**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Good Boys** - When you hear the headline ""Good Boys is first R-rated original comedy since 2016 to be #1 at the box office and the biggest original comedy debut of the year with $21M"" you can take it one of two ways. On the good side you can see this as a great way to end a summer crowded with franchise fair, which many non-Disney fair failing. However like the earth and pornography, diversity is important for the overall health of the ecosystem, so the other way you can take this news is one of despair. Really? The first R-rated comedy to be #1 since 2016, the last one being The Boss which I believe is...a fake movie. I don't think that movie is real even though I wrote about it. The first comedy to be #1 since September of last year? And this is the best comedy opening of the year? $21M? That used to be consider a mediocre opening just a few years ago and now it's heralded just for opening slightly above the teens. What is going on?
* **Good Boys** (cont.) - Comedy is in a very weird place right now. Comedy itself is well...everywhere in all kinds of forms. The internet has nichefied comedy to such an insane degree that basically you can tailor make your comedy down to the littlest details. Memes, short comedy, long comedy, stand up, surreal, film, shows, old shows, weird indie new animated surreal short comedy shows based on memes. The amount out there is endless, so the idea of the broad comedy that everybody must watch is going away. But that's been true for a while now. I think the bigger thing is, streaming may be transitioning the broad comedy away from theaters. What are the two biggest comedy hits of the summer? Not Good Boys or Stuber or Booksmart (unfortunately). It's the film Murder Mystery on Netflix and the series The Boys on Amazon. Two projects with major movie stars in comedic riffs on current trends that are extremely watched by their audiences. These things are massive hits according to their parent companies and why not? Why spend $15 to take a risk on something when I can watch the first episode of The Boys for no extra cost and go ""yeah this is great"" or ""no not for me"" and never even have to put on my pants.
* **Good Boys** (cont.) - Sorry that this discussion of this film has barely touched on the film itself, but just seeing ecstatic praise for a $21M opening has me concerned or at least wary about the future. As for the film itself it's kinda what you expect. It's got solid if not stellar reviews and a B+ on Cinemascore. It will probably do just fine by the end of its run. But that's just it, that kind of film could have easily coast to $100M domestic on just fine a few years ago. As more people become accustomed to highly produced and expensive comedies on their TV delivered at a regular pace and as long as YouTube can algorithimize my comedy tastes then comedy will continue to be in trouble at the box office. It doesn't mean the idea of comedy is going away. However, if we lose comedy from the box office landscape it feels even more like what is there left to even compete with the big tentpoles that already dominate?
* **The Angry Birds Movie 2**  - Sooooo how annoyed is everyone that technically The Angry Birds Movie 2 is the first video game movie to get a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes? Here comes the ""well actuallies"" but for now despite the surprisingly solid reviews the audience of the now decade old (jesus) mobile game franchise have probably had enough of birds v pigs. The original film was something of a minor hit for Sony, grossing $100M domestic and $300M worldwide, but that film already felt waaaaay too late to the Angry Birds train and now 3 years later even more outdated. Then you have it dropped early in the week and right before school starts (or has started for some). The whole thing felt like Sony had a solid hit and fast tracked a sequel only to realize that by the time it finally was about to come out there was just no interest in the general public. It perfectly explains why the film opened to such a terrible number, the second worst in Sony Animation history. But oh boy they will have that Castle Clash movie coming out hot and relevant in 2027. 
* **47 Meters Down: Uncaged -** It's always so funny when a franchise that has a first film with a number in the title has to have a sequel. Did you know there's a Chinese series called ""The Four"" and the sequels are ""The Four II"" and ""The Four III"". They never made it to ""The Four IV"" but maybe one day. Anyways 47 Meters Down: Another One opened this week to a weak #6 with $9M. For most films that would be pretty damn disastrous but 47MD:U (ugh) is a rather cheap affair with a $12M budget. While that's an increase from the $5.5M budget of the first film (which was originally going to be released direct to VOD) which ended up grossing over $40M domestic, it's enough that the slightly lower opening will cause problems. It seems that the boringly named Entertainment Studios was hoping that this would se an exponential growth from the first film's opening, a la John Wick. That seems to not be the case so I doubt we'll be seeing  47 Meters Down: Parabellum but hey, people need their shark movies. 
* **Blinded by the Light -** Seems either people didn't get the message about the film or The Boss is not as popular as he once was because the film that revels in Bruce Springsteen's music Blinded by the Light opened to a terrible #9 with $4.4M. The film is something of a strange option for the American audience as it feels like a British only release. The film is about a British-Pakistani man who loves Bruce and lives in Luton, a mid sized British city, and wants to leave. It's very reminiscent of films like Sunshine of Leith or Sing Street; films that have become their own mini musical genre in the country. So why did BBTL get a big push here in the states right after its British release if it feels so British? The only reason I can see is that Bruce Springsteen is a very American musician. It doesn't help that Warner Bros seemed to get extremely hyped about the movie to buy up 2,000+ theaters and then not promote it at all. In England the film is doing fine but not great. This is just a weird one culturally, a very British project about an American singer. It's maybe just a little in between all worlds to connect. It's too bad as audiences did seem to like it with an A- on Cienamscore so maybe eventually this film will find its crowd. Also, I know Blinded By the Light is a good song but you have to pick a more obvious Bruce song to get people's attention. I know calling it Born to Run is hack but hey sometimes hack sells. 
* **Where'd You Go, Bernadette -** What is going on with Richard Linklater? Here's someone who made 4 fantastic films this decade (Bernie, Before Midnight, Boyhood, Everybody Wants Some) and now ends it with this, Where'd You Go Bernadette which opened to a truly awful #11 with $3.4M. Linklater has been in an interesting slump with this and Last Flag Flying, both star studded adaptations of acclaimed novels that are going for wide appeal and Oscar attention and getting neither. The film itself was not well regarded by critics who found it one of the director's weaker efforts. But even if this was a masterpiece it would likely not have gone far, what with its production/distribution company Annapurna on the verge of complete bankruptcy. It's kinda hard to promote even a Linklater film starring Cate Blanchette when you have no money (I know, I try all the time on my limited budget). But even still the film is just too mediocre and poorly reviewed to find purchase. The good news is Linklater having dips in his career only to come out with even more audacious projects is a time honored tradition. Plus we'll always have Before Dawn on the horizon. 
* **Toy Story 4 -** Let's see the news of today: a comedy opening to #1 but with so little money it's concerning, a terrible performing animation sequel, a mediocre performing sequel to a VOD film, a poorly marketed British film, and a flop from an acclaimed director...well at least Toy Story 4 has passed over $1B...yay? Well for Pixar and Disney its certainly more good news in a fantastic year for the company. This is actually the fifth Disney film to cross $1B at the box office this year (the others being Avengers: Endgame, Captain Marvel, Aladdin, and Lion King) and would be the sixth if they owned total control of Spider-man: Far From Home. This is also the fourth Pixar movie to pass $1B at the global box office, all of which have been sequels (which is why I'm still very suspicious that Pixar is truly 'done' with sequels). TS4 actually didn't have a huge record breaking opening but in such a dull end of summer it's maintained as the best family friendly choice and in the hottest summer on record with nothing else to see. I don't see Pixar getting another $1B in the near future but don't be shocked if Disney racks up two more $1B earning films this year with Frozen II and Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker on the horizon. CONSUME ALL MEDIA!

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw** - So last week I was out because work was just......sorry done with my existential angst. Anyways let's talk large slabs of meat punching. Hobbs & Shaw was #1 for the second weekend in a row with an underwhelming $25.3M domestic. Hobbs & Shaw is a fascinating experiment in brand management, something of a concession for the fighting parties of a major franchise as well as a big step in a new direction. It's no secret Rock and Vin despise each other and this shared custody branching off of the franchise will allow Rock to keep rocking and Vin to keep mi familia-ing. But it seems that Rock and co may have overstated how much ""Fast & Furious Presents"" would allow Rock to keep the massive money train all on him. While H&S debuted last week to the worst opening weekend for the franchise since 2006's Best Picture winner Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift, it is an August release and August releases are prime for the longtail, as major films compete to be the one to hit that sweet Guardians of the Galaxy spot where you open okay but keep churning out money for months. But this weekend seems to prove that this film may not have the juice as it dropped 57.7%. While that's similar to Guardians' 52% drop on its second weekend, that film opened $35M higher. 
* **Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw** (cont.) -This is also to note that internationally the film has just crossed $330M. Decent but again we don't live in an age where decent id enough for a $200M blockbuster that's EXPECTED to cross $500M in two weekends. And no, I'm not saying Universal is packing up the goods and cancelling the whole wild Fast & Furious experience. Or even that its killing Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw & Hobbs - Revengeance: Age of Innocence anytime soon. More proof that brand management is really damn hard and even with a killer two ampersand title and the biggest movie star in the world you may not tap into that sweet surreal vein that can be so fickle and seems to constantly be moving. Perhaps I'll eat my word when H&S closes but for now, it just stands as a weird not all that winning experiment. But hey it came from a series built on wild experimentation and change. And also terribly clunky titles. Some things should never die!
* **Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark -** It must have been so annoying to hack box office people that Scary Stories only made it to #2 with $20.8M. You know they wanted to do a classic ""scares up"" pun but does #2 justify it? Anyways the adaptation of the popular children's spooky scary book was a rather interesting play of the four major new wide releases this week. August is a rather strange time for horror, too early for the more lucrative fall lead-in to Halloween and too close to the summer months to really fit in. But the value of this film is definitely in it coming in just two weeks before the majority of students return to school and this was intended as a straight to tweens/teens horror film with its PG-13 rating and young Stranger Things/IT/ummm-I-guess-Riverdale cast instead of appealing straight for that sweet nostalgia. In that regard the film did alright as 44% of the audience was under the age of 25. But the film got middling reviews from critics and a not great C rating on Cinemascore. Of course this could be the case of generational difference as older folks might be more frustrated with the film pushing aside the classic stories as part of a larger overall narrative while younger folks unfamiliar with the classic spooks might find it fun. Next weekend will tell sure (same goes for all of these films I'm discussing this week) but with a cool $20M budget this one should end up just fine no matter what.
* **Dora and the Lost City of Gold -** I appreciate we live in a time where a $50M Dora the Explorer movie exists and we all go ""oh yeah...uh-huh of course that exists"". But hey it's real and now we have to talk about another film doing some weird bit of semi-satirical take on sincere pop culture ephemera. This is to say it opened at #4 with $17M. The film pushes Dora in to high school but still maintains a fun family adventure vibe. Critics weren't insane for it but did appreciate the charm and style. However audiences that did see Dora dug it a lot, giving it an A on Cinemascore. A weird kid friendly bit of tongue in cheek humor based on a Spanish language program for very small children is ummmm a choice so I don't find the $17M opening too tragic as it's just a bit too strange to justify a massive opening. However again with that insane $50M budget it does really need to hold very well in the next coming weeks before school starts to justify costs. So again the next few weeks will really define this film's future and also the course for our continuously crumbling society. Make the $80M Street Shark movie. Just do it, let's get it over with.
* **The Art of Racing in the Rain -** Have we reached peak dog movie or have we reached peak ""have we reached"" articles because that one could actually exist? Whatever the case the case for the death of the dog movie might be The Art of Racing in the Rain (TAORITR for...short?) which opened poorly at #6 to $8.1M. The film based on the popular book by Garth Stein was something of a book blockbuster but over a decade ago in 2008. And perhaps also in a year of tons of dog movies already this just fell to the wayside. Not mention the book itself is a strange fit for this genre as it's far more lyrical and meditative than the wacky Josh Gad semi-spiritual stylings of the A Dog's franchise. Whatever the reason the critics were not fans but audiences gave it a solid A- on Cinemascore. So while it could hold well and carries a smallish $20M budget, it is too far down the pack (boo) and with another FIVE new wide releases coming next week I don't expect it to find its legs . Fuzzy, cute, adroable legs (double boo). Also this is random, but Wikipedia writers did we really need 2,000 words for the plot of this movie? Really? 
* **The Kitchen -** When a film that has a powerhouse trio like Elizabeth Moss, Tiffany Hadish, and serious mode Melissa McCarthy and it doesn't have reviews until the day of release and it's dropped off at the back end of the summer months...yeah you know something is truly rotten. And indeed critics heralded it as ""the worst of the year"" and ""just awful"" and it opened to a terrible #7 with $5.5M. The film is the first directorial effort from Andrea Berloff who wrote Straight Outta Compton and Sleepless. It seems Andrea either did not have the same abilities behind the camera or the film was stripped to ribbons in editing as most critics found the film entirely impossible to follow. Of course WB could tell the stinker they had on their hand as the film was barely marketed and came in on one of the more competitive yet potentially friendly times of the year. It's just an unfortunate affair, a film that had promise in front and behind the camera but some unknown series of events just completely ruined any chance this film ever had.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **The Lion King (2019)** \- *Don't make a royalty pun. Don't make a royalty pun.* Lion King continued its reign (*DAMN IT*) over the box office this week as it held onto #1 with $75.5M. That's actually a fairly steep drop of 60% from last weekend which could mean some of the more negative takes on the film might have some effect. That effect being it will have to wait like a day or two more to make $1B. Yes this is still a monster hit, as now the film has passed $350M domestic and $950M worldwide. So while this won't exactly become the biggest film of all time, it's certainly far from failing and will soon surpass the other slew of billion dollar Disney remakes to become the #1. All this success (see Aladdin write up below) has lead to an insane feat which is that now Disney has broken its own 2016 record for the most money made by one studio at the box office in a single year. Yes even before Frozen 2 and The Rise of Skywalker comes out the studio has amased a massive $7.67B worldwide with their 2019 films with a little under half the year left to go. Comparing the two years, it's clear the Disney forumla still works. You have a big crossover Marvel movie (Civil War/Endgame), a 'live-action' Disney remake (Jungle Book/Lion King and Aladdin), a Star War (Force Awakens/Rise of Skywalker), a Pixar sequel (Finding Dory/Toy Story 4), and a Disney aniamted film (Zootopia/Frozen 2). Box office may be down for everyone else but Disney knows what the people want...the stuff they liked before. Weirdly simple but effectively bleak.
* **Once Upon a Time in Hollywood -** In a summer where Disney's safe approach has paid off like gangbusters and every other studio's franchise fair has failed, out comes an autuer driven testament to yeteryear in every way as Tarantino's 9th and self-proclaimed penultimate film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood opened to an excellent #2 with $40.3M. The film is not just a throwback in terms of its 1969 subject matter but also in its structure. It's a film marketed entirely on A-listers and its directors. It's a 2 hour 45 minute movie that's fairly plotless that invests entirely in knowing and appreciating the director's previous work. That's just not really a film we make anymore, at least not a $90M film that needs to turn a profit and not be another notch in a streaming services belt. And Sony has banked A LOT on this film, a passion project for Sony's chief executive where he gave exclusive rights to the film in perpetuity to Tarantino forever after a certain point. So when the OUATIH toys start selling through the roof, won't Sony look foolish.
* **Once Upon a Time in Hollywood** (cont.) - But if anyone can do it it's Tino and Leo. Tarantino contiounsly managed to squeeze out profit even for his most expensive and audacious films. And Leo is well...Leo. There's a reason a Hollywood Reporter just dubbed him as ""the last movie star"", because he kind of is. Think about his last film The Revenant (man we've been Leoless for a while now) which is an over two hour long survival art film that many thought would be one of the biggest financial disasters of the decade and ended up grossing over $500M worldwide. And of course there's also Brad Pitt, who's never been the ideal box office draw but is one of our last just so damn famous people, and Margot Robbie, who if this was 20 years ago would literally be the most famous person in the world. But times are different and there's no garauantee the big opening of OUATIH will equate to a final incredible haul. The film is well regarded critically but scored a B on Cinemascore and there's a growing minority of negative voices who couldn't jive with the film. It's not an easy sell and requires 1) patience and 2) a solid knowledge of Hollywood history in the 1960s to get into. It's just not the kind of classic sell of say The Lion King. So this opening is interesting but the longtail will tell if Tarantino's mournful eulogy to times past is accurate or a bit premature.
* **The Billionaire Boyz** \- You may be tired of remakes and sequels but you know who isn't? The world. As proof both Spider-Man Far From Home and Aladdin both crossed $1B this week. For FFH that makes it the first Spidey film to ever cross that magic mark, a testament to both the longevity and constant interest in that character but more to the MCU's excellent handling of him. Also probably a film that was just Nick Fury filling paperwork for two hours would make $1B after Endgame, but hey Spidey stills deserves that nice milestone. And similarly Disney remakes are here to stay as Aladdin braved those Will Smith genie memes to also cross $1B. While the $350M domestic certainly helped, this was a huge international play across many markets: $96M in Japan, $79M in South Korea, $45M in the UK, and $53M in China. It's a testament to how popular these classic Disney stories are overseas and how screwed Disney will be when they run out of Disney Renaissance movies to remake. ""Uhhhhm guess we are doing a Three Caballeros with frighteningly realistic birds?""

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **The Lion King (2019)** \- I'm starting to think this here Disney company is on to something, as for the fifth straight week a film of theirs has been at #1 as ""newcomer"" The Lion King (2019) takes the spot with a massive $185M domestic opening. While Disney won't say Lion King (2019) an animated film because of some kind of weird cowardice, it's a goddamn computer animated film which means it beat The Incredibles 2 for the biggest ever animation opening. It also topped Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2's record as the biggest July opening. The film is an interesting beast, the most expensive of the Disney remakes and a whole new kind of filmmaking where the entire film was shot and directed in digital spaces with the use of VR. While critics were not as enthralled with the shot for shot hyper real style, audiences seem to be more down as it opened huge domestic, overseas (including $100M+ so far in China), and scored an excellent A rating on Cinemascore so I think critics will once again matter very little for this film.
* **The Lion King (2019)** (cont.) - It's been a very very good summer for Disney and pretty much no one else. While Universal is hoping to end strong with Hobbs and Shaw it's been a rough road for franchises that aren't from da mouse house. Just look at the current top 5 with its top 3 coming from the same studio. Or the five week run at #1. Or that Aladdin will probably cross $1B by next weekend. Or that Avengers: Endgame just became the highest grossing film of all time worldwide (see below). It's just been an insane moment for them. So the question becomes of course is this just the new norm, Disney box office domination with little other competition or a weird blip. One issue is that eventually this sweet spot of Disney Renaissance movies to remake will run dry and they'll have to try bigger risks (Dark Crystal live action series you cowards!) or I dunno reboot again? Neither option really seems feasible. Then there's Star Wars taking a hiatus and the guaranteed money train of Pixar sequels is ending for now. There's a sense that this could be Disney's peak but if it is it's more the top of a very gradual slope. Not to mention Disney+ is coming for your children and you cannot escape it.
* **Avengers: Endgame -** It's perhaps fitting that to start off their Marvel Direct showcase the producers first began by announcing that Avengers: Endgame finally surpassed Avatar to become the highest grossing film worldwide with $2.79B. Because the lineup of that presentation could only come from a studio confident they can just print money at every turn and their wild pitches like a horror Doctor Strange or a Lady Thor movie could only come from that well deserved arrogance. Endgame shot out like a rocket when it first opened but after that initial massive push, it became a game of inches over miles as it slowly crept towards that sweet record. The biggest help was of course a big re-release which only added a few DVD bonus level additions but that scored enough to finally push the film over the edge. And frankly I think both Avatar and Endgame deserved it. Avatar was a bold unique vision (yeah yeah get your Pocahontas jokes out, they definitely haven't gotten stale in 10 years) and for an original film to hold that title for a decade is quite impressive. And Endgame would only work that well if Marvel had been that precise and calculated with their brand management. Need I bring up another superhero team up that flopped horrible? Just because a film with all the heroes in it exists doesn't mean it will justify a huge payday. So here we are, with a dozen MCU films and shows on the horizon and Endgame taking its place at the top for a few short months until Cats makes $3B and marks the beginning of the end times.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Spider-Man: Far From Home** \- Spider-man seems keen on finally becoming a true billionaire boy as Spider-man: Far From Home held on to #1 with $45.3M domestic this weekend. That's a solid 51.1% drop, far better than Homecoming's second weekend and likely a combo of people more on board with the web-slinger again as well as the supreme disinterest in all things non-Disney this summer. Overseas, Far From Home is doing even better where it's almost grossed $200M in China, though it lost some ground when The Lion King opened to $53M in that country this weekend. That opening shows that Far From Home will likely falter some to the hyper realistic lions in the coming weeks. Still the film has topped $840M+ in just two weeks so it is practically guaranteed to become the first Spider-man film to cross $1B worldwide. Now if you'll excuse me I have to continue to find all the promo stills of Jake G as Mysterio. I need them for...reasons. PM ME JAKE G! *(I will regret this)*
* **Crawl** \- It's too bad it's no longer the 70s. I'd have so much more free coke and the trailer for Crawl would definitely end in ""Don't run to the theater. CRAWL!"". Ahh stupid modern times. Well anyways the ""what if The Shallows but gators"" premise seemed to be a good choice for folks not into the Disney stuff this weekend as Crawl opened to a pretty solid opening with $12M at #3. While not quite at the same level as the $16.8M opening of The Shallows, it's a good start and a sign that people still find things in water with sharp teeth pretty scary forever. Of course you can open like The Shallows but it doesn't mean you can hold like it, as that film ended with a very good 3.28x multiplier. Crawl scored similar to The Shallows in Cinemascore with a B rating (Shallows has a B+) rating, so it could hold well as a minor creature horror hit for the summer. So now the question is what other spooky aquatic things can one person hide from? I'd be down for Free Willy 4: The Revenge.
* **Stuber** **-** How long do you think the guy who came up with the title ""Stuber"" patted himself on the back. Like 4 hours? 8? Whatever the length the new film that matches that classic duo of Bautista and Kumail (you know a real B and K picture) opened this weekend to a pretty rough #4 with $8M. Stuber is kind of a relic of a different time in some ways. Okay yes it has two very modern people and the whole thing is about Uber, but the gruff badass matched with the funny comedian is such a staple of 80s and 90s summer comedies. It's what we used to call an ""air conditioning movie"". You don't go out of your way to see say Red Heat or Another 48 Hrs. You see it cause it exists and it stars people you like and you just want to hang with friends at the Orang Julius after. But now very few are pining to see Stuber or demanding to put up with all the hassles of movie time. Movies have become a hassle and people can watch comedy that's probably a lot more tailored to them for free on YouTube. Of course with the decline of these movies they have to come in very cheap, a measly $16M for this. So Stuber should end up just fine but in a summer of just fines and outright flops, Stuber's performance is a painfully uninteresting one.
* **The Farewell -** Well it looks like there's at least one record Endgame will not be keeping, as The Farewell managed to dethrone the space rock film, not in domestic openings but rather in best per theater averages. The film opened in 4 theaters this weekend to $351.3K, giving it a per theater average of $87.8K. That does in fact top the $76.6K per theater average of Endgame's opening weekend. That said in Endgame's favor the wider the opening, the less the average release has in terms of per theater averages so not that crazy. But still it's a very damn good sign for A24 who are really hoping this year gives them their first true no question unparalleled hit. The Farewell is a good contender, beloved by critics but also the kind of family dramedy that used to play pretty well and perhaps might find a hungry market. Of course the Steve Jobs ('15) Effect is still an issue as a great opening in costal cities does not speak for the rest of the country where it could bomb. But with a rising star in the lead with Awkwafina, I can see this play going very well for A24. If only A24 could cash in those sweet Reddit circlejerk upvotes. They'd be so damn rich.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Spider-Man: Far From Home** \- The 2019 summer blues continue for other studios but that lovely, never done anything wrong, not terrifying monopoly Disney continues to be not feel the summer heat as Spider-Man: Far From Home opened well over the July 4th holiday weekend, opening to $185M domestic for its 6 day release. It beat previous Spider-Man incarnation The Amazing Spider-Man for biggest Tuesday opening with $39.2M and almost scored the biggest July 4th with its $93.6M 3 day haul coming just under Transformers: Dark of the Moon's $97.8M haul. Overseas the film is doing quite well, scoring almost $400M after opening in three major Asian markets last weekend (China, South Korea and Japan) while it opened in all major markets except Italy (we are still salty about Italian Spider-man jokes I guess) this weekend. As per usual the pack was led by China where it's grossed a healthy $167M in that country so far. It will be interesting to see how the film drops as Spider-Man: Homecoming had one of the worst drops of the MCU with a 62.2% drop for its second weekend. The reviews and Cinemascore are practically the same for Homecoming so Far From Home could face the same drop, though Homecoming did end with a pretty good 2.85x multiplier so even with a big second weekend did Far From Home should end up doing just fine.
* **Spider-Man: Far From Home** (cont.) - In terms of the MCU, Spider-Man is in a very strange state. As the shared custody child of Daddy Disney and Step-Mom Sony it's a weird thing where Disney sets up Spider-Man solo films with these major appearances in huge crossover movies like Captain America: Civil War and the Avengers Thanos Duology and then Sony comes in with all that hype and some truly awful posters and reaps a major payday. It works for now but it gets odder when Far From Home is such a notable epilogue to the first full arc of the MCU yet all the money goes to Sony. Far From Home feels like an MCU film. It has many references to previous non-Spidey MCU films. Yet notably its very premise is extremely sweaty in a way I can't describe for fear of the spoiler cops and their many cancelled guns. That sharing seems to be working but as Spidey becomes more important in the Feige infinity gauntlet of valuable IP while Sony desperately tries to get the Me and the Boys solo movie off the ground it will continue to be a strained relationship until Disney of course devours Sony and becomes the Akira style kaiju nightmare it dreams of.
* **Midsommar** **-** There's a certain A24 horror film release strategy I love which is basically ""release it wide before people know it's weird"". And they certainly tried with Midsommar, which opened not great but okay enough at #6 with $10.8M for its five day haul. The film by Ari Aster is the immediate follow-up to last year's critical darling Hereditary which put Ari on the scene as a master horror maker and ruiner of so many a date night. Fun fact, I saw Midsommar next to a teenager and his parents who I will say were troopers and stayed for the whole thing so parents of the year or most grounded kid ever? Hereditary was a pretty good earner, ending up with almost $80M worldwide which is pretty impressive for a film with the ""thanks I hate it"" rating of D+ on Cinemascore. In that regard Midsommar did better with a much more improved but still pretty bad C+ on the polling service. It also opened worse than Hereditary, as the 3 day $6.5M of Midsommar's 3 day opening was half of what Hereditary opened to. So a big drop is far worse for this film so one hopes that weirdos will keep this one going. But Midsommar is a tough sell. I loved the movie and even I would not easily recommend it. The opening gave my bf a panic attack (and he loved it too). It's intense and creeping and slow. And it is very long for a horror film. It's not the kind of buzzy, fun, ""you have to see this"" of an Us or Quiet Place. With a $10M budget I think Aster will be fine and A24 will continue to fund his mania. But don't expect a lot of people to continue to blindly go see his movies besides absolute maniacs like me.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Toy Story 4** **-** Unfortunately I was away last weekend (big thanks to /u/fenixborealis for filling in last week) so I was not able to talk about the one goddamn movie this summer that actually made some money...or did it? Or it did but it's not enough? Or it is? Well let's get into it, shall we? This was the second weekend for the major ""final for real, last one we promise, for serious guys, never again"" in the massive franchise that started it all, and by it I mean the daily existential angst of millennials. The film opened below some of the crazier expectations but still hit a franchise high of $120.9M. And while the opening had insane tracking numbers above $150M, it's not that surprising to me that it did under that. When Toy Story 3 came out there was extreme hype for it. It had been long enough that 1 and 2 were film classics and at the time Pixar was coming off i's best run ever. Not to mention it at the time was the only Pixar franchise to have any theatrically released sequels or prequels. In that way Toy Story 3 was part of an overall trend that would dominate the studios next decade, which while it had the occasional major original hit with things like Coco and Inside Out, was very focused on sequels and prequels, producing six this decade, while making just one sequel in the previous two decades. So after a decade of constant sequels and the feeling that Toy Story 3 felt like an appropriate end to the story it's not that crazy that Toy Story 4 opened lower as people were probably very wary of potentially seeing a bad Toy Story film.
* **Toy Story 4** (cont.) - However critics quickly assuaged fans by giving the film the usually almost 100% rating on RT. So a big question now is will this make back any lost income through strong word of mouth? As of now it's unclear. TS4 is coming out the exact same time frame as TS3 so the comparisons are perfect. TS4 dropped 52.1%, which is a little steep but not too far out from TS3's drop of -46.2%. The notable thing is of course the major July 4th holiday weekend which is usually pretty good for the box office. Of course Toy Story 4 will have stiff competition from the blockbuster family hit Midsommar (and I guess Spider-Man: Far From Home) but Toy Story 3 had major teen film competition in its day and managed to make a good chunk of change during the weekend, nearly $50M. TS4 may not get that much and may be looking at a run closer to $300M domestic than TS4's $400M, but it's a good start. Overseas though is where the film is really not doing as well as TS3. A lot has been said about how the new release of the 18 year old film Spirited Away outgrossed Toy Story 4 in China ($25M vs $13.2M) but as we've seen with Star Wars, China is very wary of franchises that have not played a lot in the country before, and no other TS films have been released theatrically there. But in films where TS3 did insanely well, namely United Kingdom where the film grossed over $100M, and it has only grossed $16M so far. So yes, Toy Story 4 is doing well, about to pass $500M worldwide which is a usual success marker for a $200M film, but still this is not shappening up to be the massive $1B easy blockbuster Disney was expecting. At least not yet. But hey you gonna sneeze at $300M domestic...okay if you're Disney you might.
* **Annabelle Comes Home -** Speaking of a franchise weary summer, Annabelle Comes Home arrived with a load of laundry and a bad attitude as it opened to #3 with $20.3M domestic. That's the worst opening in the now 6 film Conjuring franchise. That's also $15M less than the previous two Annabelles which opened above $35M. Now of course look at the budget then look at the worldwide gross. Yeah it may not be making Conjuring franchise money but that franchise is insane and has always been an outlier in the horror market for how  crazy successful it is. For any horror film this is a pretty good opening and wisely WB spread it out, with the film opening a week early in overseas markets with a $45M gross so far and was released on Wednesday domestic with a total gross of $31M so far. So yeah with a $15M budget one expects this film to do just fine for WB in the long run. But the the bigger question is where this places the Conjuring films culturally. It's not a bomb but it is a crack in an otherwise flawless box office run. And with Wan probably too busy with his movies about aquatic men it seems unlikely for a main Conjuring film to come around and help revitalize the franchise with all new potential spookems spin-offs. Perhaps this just means the end for now for the spooky doll and her spooky ways but I imagine WB will find someway to rebrand her. Maybe Annabelle vs Batman?
* **Yesterday** **-** I don't think any recent theatrical film better represents the Netflix Effect more than Yesterday. But first let's talk numbers as the film that imagines what if Ed Sheeran could take credit for producing Beatles music opened to $17M at #3. That's actually above early tracking numbers and for a $26M budget film (which is kind of insane for how much extremely expensive Beatles music is to license) that's pretty solid. Even better, despite getting mediocre reviews from critics it seems audiences are game for Yesterday as it scored an A- on Cinemascore. This could mean a potentially great run as a counter-programming choice, especially to older groups who love the Beatles and hate all this superhero shenanigans. But I do wonder, what if this was a Netflix movie? I think about films like Bird Box and Always Be My Maybe and think about how despite these being big cultural hits that are widely discussed, would they really open above like #3? To me a film like Yesterday is a perfect example of that. I have had so many people react strongly to the trailer. Multiple people have told me their normally not movie interested family is dying to see it.
* **Yesterday** (cont.) **-** So why such a muted opening? Because Yesterday is that perfect Netflix movie. It's not big and bombastic and loud. It's a rom com with a fun sci-fi/fantasy twist and great music that's just kinda okay. It's the kind of film Netflix was made for, easy to make a trailer out of two months before it releases, drop it, promote the shit out of it on the site, and bang, it's the cultural hit of the week. I don't really know if that's good or bad but more it's just different. Yesterday likely went theatrical because of that initial high and the major elements like the Beatles music and Ed Sheeran being like the fourth lead. But in a time where franchises are failing left and right, it's also notable that original ideas with a buzzy premise aren't flying either. The landscape is just changing to a point it will become unrecognizable to what it was even ten years ago. Now of course you can see all about my take on an alternate what if the film Yesterday was released on Netflix with the film ""All Our Yesterday"" streaming now direct to Crackle.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Men in Black International -** Men in Black International, the attempt to relaunch the once super popular film franchise sans Will Smith and TLJ, opened to a very weak $28.5M domestic at #1 this weekend. While that's not nearly as bad as say Dark Phoenix (see below) that's still super rough for a major relaunch of a wanna-be franchise that cost over $100M to market and had a seemingly huge ad campaign. It seems this is part of a general Sony strategy of trying desperately to relaunch the few working franchises they have. Look at the way Ghostbusters was handled. Sony put a lot of marketing power into fighting back against the negative perceptions of the film and trying to prove how vital and important then film was and then it bombed and they said ""oh never mind here's a reboot from the son of the original director"". MIBI (great acronym) is definitely another notch in that.
* **Men in Black International** (cont.) - For one taking two leads from a more popular series is a key eyebrow raise. But more than anything it just felt going in to MIBI this existed because it sold well on a corporate earnings call. ""Great news everyone, we have an exciting fresh take on the popular Men in Black franchise"". I think it's not too hard to see why this failed, it was a gamble that a major corporation thought was a surefire hit. Whether it's more the brand or the man, Will Smith continues to do pretty well for himself with Aladdin about to cross $750M worldwide. And without him and TLJ I don't know how many people would care. Lackluster trailers certainly don't help either and ultimately to me and many this felt like corporate homework. Go see MIBI in theaters and get $5 in Playstation store credit. Now eat the MIBI branded popcorn. Eat it!
* **Shaft (2019)** \- Who's the man who's film  just opened to #6 with a terrible $8.3M? ...it...it's Shaft. come on don't make me do the whole song parody thing. Yeah the rather odd franchise of Shaft is one of the more strange in film history as the original film did in fact have two sequels but then it morphed into something...else. The original film is easily the most famous of the blaxploitation movement of the 70s, with Shaft (played by Richard Roundtree) being a symbol for black empowerment and general badassery. However two sequels, Shaft's Big Score and Shaft in Africa, failed to garner the same level of attention and it felt like the series was one purely of the 70s. But in 2000 director John Singleton rebooted the Shaft brand with lead Samuel L. Jackson and surprisingly made it a direct sequel to Shaft, with SLJ playing the nephew of Shaft. The results were a poorly received film but one that did pretty well, with $21M opening and ended up at $100M worldwide.
* **Shaft (2019)** (cont.) - The same could not be said here which again adds a new Shaft, this time Shaftson played by Jessie Usher, while still maintaining the first two Shafts. I'm tired of the word shaft now. The results were far far worse and despite a healthy ad campaign the attention was just not there. I think this is just a case of a franchise just being too damn old for folks to really want to see it. The original film is almost 50 years old and the reboot is almost 20 years old. The 2000 film did well but back then it was commenting on a 29 year old film, and we've seen with modern successful reboots that the magic sweet spot for nostalgia is in that 20 - 30 year old range. The hilariously bad Shaft twitter certainly didn't help (definitely go through that for some /r/comedyheaven level memes) but ultimately in a summer already done with needless franchises is all that shocking a reboot this late to the game is met with such disinterest. Oh and to top it all off the film was sold to Netflix for international distribution so it's probably made up the $35M budget before it was even released. Don't you just love the industry? Boy I'm cynical today.
* **Late Night** **-** Even non franchise fair is having a rough go of it as the indie comedy Late Night failed to garner much interest this weekend opening weak at #9 with $5.1M. The film written and starring Mindy Kaling was well reviewed during the festival circuit and certainly feels like the kind of film that film critics pine more for. A good comedy starring women and produced by a person of color. Yet still it seems that audiences just don't care enough to go out there. And in this case I really feel the shadow of streaming. I like Kaling and the co-lead Emma Thompson. It's playing at a theater I go to with AMC A-List so there's no real monetary invest for me beyond the gas to drive there. But still I'm busy and I just know this will eventually be on streaming. This is not to excuse myself for being part of the problem (it is but that's not all) but to say there's millions of those stories playing out every weekend. When entertainment becomes as easy as turning on a device and clicking a few buttons the prospect of including all those other steps to get to the theater becomes tedious. And so films like Late Night suffer. Also it's about Late Night comedy, one of increasingly irrelevant forms of entertainment out there. Is it that shocking people aren't clamoring to see that?
* **Random thoughts -**  ...are we at a turning point in cinema history right now? Is this a moment that 20 years later we look back and say, this is when things broke before they were rebuilt/changed? What is happening to franchise filmmaking right now? Each week this summer seems to bring a new DOA franchise entry, from all different studios on all different genres and each one keeps failing. On the one hand it could just be this is a bad summer season which I think is fair. Men in Black International, Shaft, Secret Life of Pets 2, Godzilla: KOTM, and Dark Phoenix all had middling to bad reviews and were generally not super well received by the general public either. Bad movies making bad money isn't rocket science but it's also not the norm. Think of the heyday of the Transformers, where terrible film after terrible film kept making insane money. But then that series finally lost the ability to just shit out money and now even its best reviewed entry, Bumblebee, ends up being its lowest grossing.
* **Random thoughts** (cont.) **-** And look I'm also not a fool to see that there are things that are working. The most successful franchise of all time, the MCU, had the 2nd biggest film domestically and internationally with Avengers: Endgame before the summer season began and will have a follow-up with Spider-man: Far From Home in a few weeks that is tracking at $150M+ opening. Toy Story 4 is poised to potentially become the biggest animated film of all time. Aladdin is doing well, almost certainly will pass $800M worldwide and even if Lion King is a literal 2hr dumpster fire it will certainly pass $1B worldwide. But notice something about those films, yeah all owned by Disney. And not even Disney/Fox, just Disney. That just makes the balance more off-kilter. If only one studio is making a profit that means the industry has become even more unstable and will continue towards less interesting material until it busts.
* **Random thoughts** (cont.) **-** Look I'm not pining for the days when garbage franchise could shit out whatever and make a buck despite the quality. I like a world where China rejects Dark Phoenix but loves Capernaum, a Lebanese art movie that made over $50M in China. And this could just be a weak summer but I feel like more and more I've been saying this could just be a weak summer/winter/fall/spring. Star Wars now has flops and needs retooling. Disney remakes now have flops. A mainstay X-Men movie with a massive cast opens below an M Night Shyamalan superhero movie that's a sequel to an off-shoot of a 19 year old movie. Shit is out of control off-balance and it's only a matter of time before the industry finds new hits or has to go through another New Hollywood era or just dissolve away into a series of TV shows and webseries, making media even more fragmented than it is. And again I don't know if that's a bad thing. I'll take a lot more limited series like Big Little Lies, Chernobyl, and When They See Us over Men in Black International and Secret Life of Pets 2. Or hell more John Wicks, lower budget mid-tier genre franchises that don't feel the need to dazzle, because audiences cannot be dazzled anymore by effects. I think the real test will be Avatar 2. If even James Cameron cannot crack the franchise fatigue code, I think the industry needs to properly have a collective heart attack and massively revaluate. I don't think we are over the edge, but the edge seems to be coming closer and closer.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **The Secret Life of Pets 2 -** For how massive the 2019 blockbuster season began with Avengers: Endgame it's been a rather muted start with notable disappointments from once very successful franchises. This week saw two of those, first with The Secret Life of Pets 2 which opened at #1 to a disappointing $47.1M. The original is a film people probably forgot was an absolute monster hit as the first one opened to a massive $100M+ and closed over $350M domestic, so a second film seemed like a surefire thing. Even with the replacement of the lead voice actor Louis C.K. after the comedian faced major sexual misconduct allegations, the film arrived mostly drama free and at the same time slot just three years later. So why then did this open to almost half the original? Well for one the trailers and the marketing for Secret Life of Pets were rock solid, doing the classic Illumination thing of putting the easiest and best gags in the trailer and making it perfect YouTube entertainment fodder for kids. But the actual film was not a light series of gags, but rather a somewhat violent adventure film with the most cliche plot around. Not exactly something that drives parents and kids to have to see a second one.
* **The Secret Life of Pets 2** (cont.) **-** The second one just has not had the same level of hype at all, feeling more like a perfunctory well we had to make a second one so eat it up! But more urgently is there's a wee bit of a behemoth franchise coming out in two weeks, the child friendly franchise Child's Play. Come on, the family friendliness is even in the title! Oh yeah and Toy Story 4 is coming out and almost certainly will pass $100M domestic in opening and that number could potentially go as high as $200M. That's a lot of families who are probably convincing their kids a 2,000th watch of Secret Life of Pets on DVD is good enough and saving the $50+ trip to the movies for the big event. But doesn't that make Disney's take over of blockbuster culture more inevitable and sad? What are the three blockbusters of the summer that so far have been unqualified successes? Endgame, Aladdin and soon Toy Story 4. Meanwhile major franchise fair from other studios has found very little purchase this season. Look not saying I'm pitying the Minions folks for not making more money, and with such a low for animation budget this will do just fine in the end. Still it is telling that despite how much you may hate Disney live action reboots, MCU films, or Pixar sequels, goddamn it so far they are the only ones that are just pure successes this summer...oh and also John Wick 3.
* **Dark Phoenix** \- Well as much as it pains me as a fan of the franchise to say this, is there any more fitting way for such a wild, long running, unwieldy, tonally inconsistent, quality inconsistent, and bizarrely structured series to end than this? A collective giving up on the franchise with a film that is so ashamed of the franchise title it doesn't even carry the X-Men moniker in the official US release. Yes ""Dark Phoenix"" (called X-Men: Dark Phoenix in every non-coward country) ~~closed~~ opened this week to a truly awful $33M at #2. That's the worst opening for the X-Men franchise, dropping below previous 'winner' The Wolverine at $53.1M. Now yes the film is not the final Fox film with X-Men characters but not only is New Mutants its own beast not related to the 'timeline' (if you can call that total mess of a continuity that) but it's not coming out until *checks calendar* 2037 so this really feels like the end of an era. And god what a colossal disinterest in the franchise in such a short time. X-Men: Days of Future Past was released just 5 years ago and seemed to be putting the X-Men back on track with a fantastic $90M opening. But now we get to here, the second adaptation of the Dark Phoenix comic book arc, written by the same writer of the first attempt, with even worse reviews and a pitiful opening that's almost 1/3 the opening of Days of Future Past.
* **Dark Phoenix** (cont.) - I don't think it's that hard to see how we got here. Future Past was a fluke in the midst of the beginning of the total dominance of the MCU on superhero franchise making and its wildly carefree tone to the cinematic universe style was quickly out of fashion. DOFP got away from it by being a multi-generational time traveling epic but once we went back to deal with Apocalypse and whatever the audience was already losing interest. Trying again just 12 years later to do Dark Phoenix felt cheap and wanting and the whole cast feels like they could be anywhere else. It just doesn't have the verve anymore and you can feel the audience feeling it. Even worse the film is stupidly expensive, a massive $200M because the entire final fight scene had to be scrapped after terrible audience test reactions which ballooned the budget considerably. >!At least they didn't have to pay J Law insane money to come back for those reshoots.!< So yeah this is a disaster, one that Kevin Feige will happily drag the corpse to Bob Iger's office and say ""yeah we can all agree this can be totally rebooted from scratch right?""
* **Dark Phoenix** (cont.) - But honestly I will miss this weird ass franchise. In being so scattershot and strange you got weird films that you don't feel would be made elsewhere. How insane the two highest grossing films in the franchise are R-rated mid budget comedies. And what about Logan or the long delayed New Mutants, unique genre exercises you are just not getting from the MCU. But then on the business side it's hard to argue. The X-Men films have always had incredible casts yet in 19 years and 12 movies they couldn't top the worldwide gross of the 4 Avengers movies released in just 7 years. X-Men paved the way for the superhero films of today but like innovators in so many fields it just never found the right balance and thus ends not with a bang, but with a whimper and being sold to the company that came along after them and did it better. Farewell OG X-Men series, you wild weird ride that ended with me puking on the tracks. Or something, you write your own metaphors.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Godzilla: King of the Monsters -** Poor pun based box office writers. You know they've had their ""Godzilla is King of the box office"" headlines ready for weeks but I'm not so sure that Godzilla: King of the Monsters opening at #1 with $49M is really worthy of royalty status. The sequel to the 2014 reboot of the American Godzilla franchise and third film in the 'Monsterverse' was not exactly a major franchise crowning itself god of all as the film opened $40M less than Godzilla '14 which opened to $92M. Overseas the numbers are a little healthier, topping off the worldwide gross with $179M, but the thing is kaiju movies have never been global blockbuster events. If we are counting King Kong (which is part of the Monsterverse, so I think so) then Kong: Skull Island is the biggest one ever at $566.6M, with almost $400M of that from overseas. And Godzilla '14 made just $325M overseas so Godzilla: KOTM needs to do way better domestically or else it will be a major blow to the franchise, especially with another film coming in less than a year (Godzilla vs King Kong). So why did this film do so much less than the previous film featuring the chonky scalie boy?
* **Godzilla: King of the Monsters (cont.) -** Well for outside factor we must note this weekend was the same as the NBA Finals on Sunday. I went to see Rocketman at the same time (are you shocked I'm not a sports guy?) and the theater was a ghost town. But that doesn't explain the low opening of $19.6M on the first day. The reviews certainly didn't help, with critics slamming the film for its over-reliance on monster fights over terrible human characters. And while kaiju fans are used to terrible characters that you tolerate to get to the big monster fights, maybe that's a tradition that doesn't *have* to exist, especially when trying to appeal to a wider audience. Also even kaiju fans seems mixed on the film, more positive than Godzilla '14 but still some strong negative vibes. I think WOM on this one could be terrible, and I wouldn't be shocked at a strong drop-off next weekend. There's also just the subject matter itself. The 2014 film was based on the most recognizable Godzilla film, the 1954 original Gojira. But the closest analog to Godzilla: KOTM is 1964's Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster which is about a princess being taken over by an alien ghost and who warns of a space dragon that will destroy the world (for real). Basically what I'm saying is, this one is for kaiju nerds, not the regular audience. And the audience likely got their fill of the big boy in 2014 which was criticized for not enough Godzilla action and people don't want to get duped again. Whatever the cause Godzilla vs King Kong will need a major glow-up for this franchise to continue, lest Toho once again takes the rights and scampers off into the night.
* **Godzilla: King of the Monsters (cont.) -** Also make a $150M solo Mothra movie, you absolute fucking cowards.
* **Rocketman** \- Despite me buying 12 tickets to just see the Taron Egerton/Richard Madden sex scene over and over the biopic about Elton John's life Rocketman did not hit #1 but did manage to score a very good debut at #3 with $25M. So of course the comparison here is to Bohemian Rhapsody, the other film about a massive 70s queer musician which definitely has and will trounce Rocketman in all box office comparisons, opening twice what Rocketman just did and going on to gross an insane $900M worldwide. But I don't think that was ever in the cards for Rocketman, which let's be frank took a lot more risks than BR. For one the film is R-rated, becoming the first American studio film to show a male on male love scene (before your comments, Brokeback Mountain was made and distributed by an independent studio). It already has faced major edits from homophobic countries like Russia and will struggle for that reason. Also the film is not your standard biopic, as it is a straight up jukebox musical retelling of Elton John's life, with various people singing his songs and large dance sequences. And while Elton John was the biggest selling artist of his day, I'm not sure younger people adore him so much they will rush out to see his biopic ASAP.
* **Rocketman (cont.)** \- So the lower opening is expected and it is the 4th biggest musical biopic opening, so it's done well in terms of overall comparisons. The real test will be how the film holds and that's harder to know. It scored a very good A- on Cinemascore, by so did All Eyez on Me, the Tupac biopic that opened the same as Rocketman but dropped like a rock when fan backlash killed its momentum. So far it seems Elton fans are very happy with the film and with it being an older generation play (55% of the opening weekend audience was over 30) you tend to see long consistent holds versus massive openings. But the pure musical style could turn off some people who don't want something so different, and may just want to see the standard Walk Hard but serious movie they've done 100,000 times now. Look you may find that style tiring but just last year it made $900M and won 4 Oscars so don't expect it to go away any time soon. Speaking of it definitely feels like Rocketman has set itself up as an early Oscar frontrunner, with Taron Egerton and the costume design feeling like locks already, though of course much of that will change in the coming months and will depend heavily on the film's performance and how many people like me ship Madderton.
* **Ma** \- MA! Get in here, Ma just opened up at #4 with $18.2M, Ma! MAAAAA! Okay I'm done, but for real the horror film that dared to ask what if Octavia Spencer was spooky had a pretty good opening this week, especially in comparison to its $5M budget. The film focused  a lot of its branding on the fact that beloved character actress Octavia Spencer was playing bad and not playing nice to some white person in trouble (ooooh the comments, they're coming in hot). The film scored decent-ish reviews, mostly for Spencer's performance but seemed less enthused by audiences with a B- on Cinemascore. I expect a fairly hefty drop next weekend but that's the thing with horror, you cost $5M to make and it doesn't really matter how bad your next weekend is cause you already got that money baby. Hopefully this will inspire a new wave of actors who usually play nice people turning evil. Tom Hanks serial killer movie when?

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Aladdin (2019) -** Aladdin this weekend proved just how sick and tired everyone is of these live action Disney remakes as it opened to a meager 4-day holiday haul of $112.7M at #1. I kid of course, because I am a hack. Indeed it was actually a pretty good opening, the fifth best Memorial Day opening and the biggest opening ever for a blue Will Smith movie. Yes genie's out of the sorting hat folks, let's talk about them digital pecs. The road for Aladdin has been an odd one. Perhaps it's no surprise that in a year that sees both the finalization of the Disney/Fox merger and the release of four major live-action remakes/sequels to Disney animation classics that at least one of them would become the poster child for all things Disney ruining cinema. Enter in the first images of the genie in this new adaptation and the internet went buck wild with memes of all sorts. While that seems quaint in a post Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer world, it combined with the low sales of Dumbo it seemed to make many that this would be the first true unexpected bomb of this Disney remake boom. So why did this make money when so many things seemed troubling?
* **Aladdin (2019) (cont.) -** Well for one, as I said when Dumbo came out I felt the failure of that film was far more due to the subject matter than an overall disdain for the Disney remake machine. That was based on a film from the 1940s that while I'm sure many of us watched, was probably not watched literally over 1,000 times by most current millennial in the country like say Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King were. And let's not forget how good the Memorial Day weekend can be. It gives you a nice holiday, right before school closes and some kids are already done with classes. It makes sense a big expensive kid friendly musical would do well. Also expect a potentially great hold, especially with a great A rating on Cinemascore and the true start of summer break. However the domestic holds will have to do pretty well for two reasons. One this film was mad expensive. $180M is quite a lot even for a big tentpole film. And worse off the film did not perform super well overseas, pulling in a solid but not great $121M. That includes every major market including China where it opened to just $18M. So it will have a long road domestically to get to profitability, but it has a great head start and this films tend to hold very well. At the very least it's a good reminder that the internet can often be ignored on these things and doesn't have the power to meme a film out of existence. Except for Sonic the Hedgehog. That film is screwed.
* **Brightburn** \- The film that dared to ask ""what if Superman but bad"" did not completely enthrall the audience as it opened fairly low at #5 with $9.5M domestic for the four day weekend.  The film that was hyped as from the producing paycheck of James Gunn was a whole Gunn family affair with his cousin and brother writing the screenplay. The film by Sony Pictures Classics was definitely not expecting to be a massive opening weekend and with a pretty low $6M budget the film had a lot of potential to make good money with a hit horror film run. But the issue with that is most horror films need to open over $10M because they drop so quickly (and with a terrible C+ Cinemascore expect the same here) and it definitely felt like Brightburn had more of a marketing push than most. It's hard to say exactly why this failed, whether the premise alone only intrigued a small fan-base or what I think the bigger issue is the release date. The three new releases this weekend were a family friendly Disney film, a teen comedy, and a violent take on the most popular movie genre currently. To me this was a perfect September/October release when people are more friendly to horror films. Of course the problem there is the rare behemoth horror release in IT: Chapter 2 which will choke out most competition. Still Memorial Day feels so strange to me, unless they were going for an attempt to critique/comment on the multiple superhero films that came right before its release. Brightburn will probably find a cult audience and eventually turn a profit (it's too cheap not to) but it shows that just because it's about any superhero/villain doesn't mean people are going to flock to see it.
* **Booksmart** \- This is one of those films where you are just kind of bummed out it didn't do well. One of the best reviewed films of the year that's written, directed, and starring women with a good queer main character and is genuinely well received by audiences. And it opens at #6 with $8.6M for the four day weekend. So what happened? Well for one it seems that United Artists Releasing has had a rough go in their new iteration, first with the super bomb Missing Link and then the mediocre performance of The Hustle. Also this is one of those films that just does suffer from no super A-list names involved. Yes Olivia Wilde is the director, but I know many who don't even know that. And the leads are two very funny up-and-comers but going ""oh hey isn't that one of the recurring guest stars from What We Do in the Shadows"" doesn't sell a ton of tickets to anyone who isn't me. Still what about Superbad? Yeah now an Apatow film, written by Seth Rogen, starring Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Bill Hader, Seth Rogen, and Emma Stone is a surefire hit but that film made most of those guys. Why wasn't Booksmart the female equivalent of that? I think the reason that film made $121M domestic and this won't (unless it has one of the craziest second lives ever) is because of a really killer trailer. Y'all who weren't in high school then have no goddamn idea how much McLovin jokes I heard *before* the film came out. That thing was everywhere so when it came out it felt like an event. Booksmart just did not have the marketing prowess or reach to get to that level, so like so many other great teen movies being made right now (seriously we are living in the best time for great teen movies since the 80s imo) like so many of them Booksmart will be discovered on Netflix or Amazon like all the rest.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **John Wick: Chapter 3** **- Parabellum -** Not only have the titles in the John Wick series doubled in size each time (John Wick, John Wick: Chapter 2, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum) but so has their opening weekends with the latest opening at #1 with $57M. That's almost double the opening of the previous film ($30M) which itself was double the opening of the first film ($15M). In fact this opening made more in a single weekend than the first film made in its entire run ($43M). This series has been the definition of a slow burn to major franchise and one of the more fascinating to watch. Before its release in 2014 the first film felt like your average run of the mill programmer with a boring title (fite me), an October R-rated action movie with a star on the wain. But John Wick surprised with great reviews and it held well enough to make a decent profit and justify the sequel. But that's when the film pulled something only the most special franchises like Pitch Perfect and Austin Powers did, find an insane second life on home viewing before the sequel. Wick became the internet's golden boy and by 2 the film moved from the harsher October months to the somewhat kinder February. The success of that film now means 3 opens in the beginning of summer, sandwiched between family friendly fair like Detective Pikachu and Aladdin.
* **John Wick: Chapter 3** **- Parabellum** \- I mean just think about how a franchise that is all about gory new ways for a man in a suit to murder folks opened the same as a goddamn Pikachu movie. That's a truly crazy feat and a testament that if you make small scale movies that people enjoy and you just keep that quality going you can find success. It's pretty remarkable that this franchise turned the name John Wick into one of legendary film badass status. Now Wick is just part of the culture, becoming the new Chuck Norris in meme culture (yes I'm a thousand years old, I know) and even playing a pivotal part in the video game Fortnite. It's really quite an amazing feat, even more so that the budgets stay in their lane. John Wick 3 isn't a $150M action epic, it's a $55M well produced series of impressive set pieces. This is a franchise that knows why audiences come to it and doesn't over extend itself to become something it's not. And as long as the quality maintains I think we will definitely see the box office continue to rise. So if we keep with this idea of each film doubling the previous opening I look forward in 2025 to proudly announce that John Wick: Chapter 6 - Eternium: Dawn of the High Table: Part 2 broke the opening weekend record with a massive $480M opening.
* **Avengers: Endgame** \- I swear I don't intend to keep writing about this film but damn son it just keeps making new records. This week the film became just the second film since Avatar's release to pass its domestic record, becoming the second highest film domestic at $770M. That gives it the #2 spot on both the domestic and worldwide spots. Speaking of, the film is creeping up on that worldwide record as the film stands at $2.61B, now $175M away from the $2.788B record set by Avatar. While not a monumental amount compared with how much money the film has made already, it's still quite a lot especially with potential major competition ahead. Endgame benefited a lot this week from Detective Pikachu under-performing overseas but this weekend sees the release of Aladdin. And look memes aside this is a major remake of a hit Disney film that has international appeal. It could easily eat into that Endgame run and cut it off right at the finish line. And yes what a tragedy, a Disney film might be too successful and cause another Disney film to keep from making the most money. Capitalism!
* **A Dog's Journey** \- Guess the audience only wanted to see one heartwarming tale of watching a dog die over and over as the sequel to A Dog's Purpose opened this week to a terrible #4 with $8M. The film which continues the tale of Josh Gad voiced dogs violently dying was an...odd choice of a sequel to make. However, the first film, despite initial controversies, was a pretty good hit making $64.5M domestic and over $200M worldwide. So why did this fail so much? I think the main issue was titling it A Dog's Journey. See I don't know if you've noticed but the cinema has become really clogged up with A Dog's movies as there was also A Dog's Way Home that came out just four months ago and despite the same title structure and writer, it has no connection to this very weird franchise. And I know a lot of people who were confused which one was which or why there was so many films called A Dog's something. But to be frank this looks like the cheapest movie released in major theaters as it doesn't even have a known budget and I feel like Dennis Quaid was paid in denim jackets. So it will probably make enough to justify whatever meager costs there was but this will exists forever to me as the weirdest damn franchise as evidence by the hilariously named Box Office Mojo page [A Dog's Franchise](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=dogfranchise.htm)
* **The Sun is Also a Star** \- The film that dared to point out that the sun is in fact a star, had a terrible opening at #8 with $2.6M this weekend. The film is actually not the world's least informative TED talk but in fact a romantic teen drama based on a popular YA novel. The film was clearly aimed directly at a teen audience as it stars two big actors from popular network TV shows, Yara Shahdi from Grown-ish and Charles Melton from Riverdale. However the thing about teens is they really don't give a crap about the theater, especially with actors they have probably seen almost exclusively through streaming platforms. It's rather bizarre to me this was a big WB release, even with a very low budget of $9M. This feels like a million Netflix movies being made for teens right now and I don't get why WB thought they would ever get kids to show up to something they get for free every week on Netflix. It will probably find a second life on streaming but that's the point, the theatrical market for this kind of film just doesn't really exist anymore.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Avengers: Endgame** \- I'm not sure if the fact that Detective Pikachu is the biggest video game opening of all time and it still didn't beat Endgame's second weekend is a sign of just how strong Endgame opened or how weak most video game movies are at the box office, but whatever the case Endgame beat the competition to come in #1 for third weekend in a row with $63M. That puts it's domestic total at a massive $723.4M, the third biggest of all time behind only Avatar ($760M) and The Force Awakens ($936M). However it's pretty much certain that while the film will capture the #2 spot, that domestic record is completely done for as the film dropped big again this weekend with 57%. In fact it's just $1M higher than what Infinity War made on its third weekend and that film opened $100M lower than Endgame. As for worldwide the record to beat Avatar is still in play but it seems like things are a lot less probable than before. The film is $300M away from the Avatar number, and while that seems like a pittance compared to the $2.4B it's made so far, let's not forget that $300M is no easy feat for most films and while Endgame is certainly not like most is slowing down with such big hits as Detective Pikachu and Detective Conan (both real films) cutting into worldwide, though it does stand at a massive $1.7B. So it will be close, damn close but maybe the Russos and Marvel need to prepare for the possibility Endgame will only be the second biggest film domestic and worldwide. What a terrible tragedy. RIP Disney.
* **Pokemon: Detective Pikachu** \- Whether it was the extreme devotion to the most successful media franchise of all time or because of that goddamn lil hat but whatever the case Detective Pikachu became the winner of the not very competitive video game movie race with the biggest opening ever for a film based on vidya opening at #2 with $58M. Interestingly that's actually under some of the more intense predictions for the film which had it over $100M (a hype I can't deny I bought into as well). It's certainly not the best opening for a major budgeted film of $150M, but it's not dire either. Just...okay. The film based on the recent video game of the same name was a rather strange choice for the first rendition of the Pokemon universe since the game wasn't even out in the US when it was first announced. But early trailers seemed promising with the Pokemon looking accurate to their original designs versus the hideous god trash that is Sanic the Hergehead. And it holds another title, the best reviewed video game movie on Rotten Tomatoes which is saying a lot for how dire the video game movie landscape is that a 63% is the new high bar.
* **Pokemon: Detective Pikachu (cont.)** \- So with all that working for it why wasn't this opening higher? Well for one, just because you like a Pokemon thing, it doesn't mean you like Pokemon in general. Yes 1 billion (!) people downloaded Pokemon Go but doesn't mean you want to spend two hours with your favorite app characters (mmm I can feel the angry comments flowing in). And there's just the fact this is DETECTIVE PIKACHU. No Ash, no Team Rocket, no Red and Blue, no Pokemon pinball, nothing. It asks a lot of the audience to be invested in the world of an okay video game hit. However, there's some good news for the lil guy in the liler hat, the film scored a very good A- on Cinemascore so it could hold very well in the coming weeks, especially being the only major kids movie choice until Aladdin two weeks from now. Overseas the film grossed a solid $100M+, more than Endgame this weekend, mostly lead by a very good $41M debut in China. Japan has seen solid returns but nothing spectacular at $10M so far. So that's where we are at culturally, talking about Pikachu in a little hat. I dunno y'all want climate change to move a little faster or you hyped for Lil Hat 2: The Lilest Hat?
* **The Hustle** \- And thus begins the round-up of the three films where you go ""wait that's a movie?"" or ""wait that came out already?"". First up we have The Hustle, the all female remake (reddit's favorite genre!) of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (itself a remake), which opened this weekend to a pretty underwhelming #3 with $13.5M. The film starring Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson seemed to be on shaky ground going into the weekend when the embargo for reviews didn't lift until the day of release and predictably when reviews came in the film was savaged, earning a pitiful 15% on RT. With a budget of $27M the film seems to be squeezing enough juice just out of the cast alone as worldwide it's crossed $27M, but don't expect it to stick around long with those kind of reviews. Perhaps the biggest Hustle of all was getting money out of the people who saw it?? Honestly, y'all it's been a long week and I could care less about this film. Next.
* **Poms** \- Now here's something really strange. Not an STX film being a giant bomb, that's about as expected as a sunrise. No a film with this many famous people in it that just...doesn't exist. I mean it might but did anyone really seem Poms, which did in fact open to #6 with $5.1M? Apparently it stars Diane Keaton, Jacki Weaver, Rhea Perlman, and Pam Grier which would be crazy if it were true. Definitely seems like what STX was going for here was some of that sweet sweet Book Club magic but a film about old people being cheerleaders (apparently that's the premise, shrug) is not as marketable as old people getting horned up by Fifty Shades books. At least I guess that's the case because I haven't seen a single piece of marketing anywhere in the last six months. At least the film got twice as good of reviews as The Hustle which means it only got a 30% on RT. STX what are you doing? First UglyDolls then this? You...you all don't exist right? Like you're just the nightmare that other studios dream about, but somehow you're real? STX are you the Freddie Krueger of movie studios?
* **Tolkien** \- The third film in the Nicholas Hoult Biopic Cinematic Universe (but only the second to see full release) opened this week in 1,500 theaters to a pretty bad #9 at $2.1M. The film about the legendary author of that hippie song Leonard Nimoy sang was originally planning a wide release but interest in the film's marketing on social media convinced the studio to not only put the film in wide release but also do a Fathom events 2 days before opening with a Q&A hosted by major Tolkien nerd and sometime late night host Stephen Colbert. The results of all of this (Fathom's earnings are included in the final number but only amount to around $200K) was a pretty poor showing and a good example that internet interest does not equal actual ticket sales. Of course this wouldn't have happened if you cowards had just released the Weinstein Cut of The Current War. Finish the NHBCU trilogy!

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Avengers: Endgame** \- Avengers: Endgame continues to fatigue to a second weekend at #1 with $145.8M domestic. That's a better second weekend than most initial movie's openings (it's higher than the 25th biggest opening of all time, The Twilight Saga: New Moon at $142M) but it is notably a 59% drop from last weekend. That's such a significant drop that despite opening $110M more than The Force Awakens the film did not top TFA for biggest second weekend gross, missing it by just $5M. Now that could be Disney underestimating Endgame on Sunday so actuals could have Endgame just barely beating TFA, but being so close shows just how front-loaded Endgame was as this clearly was not a competition issue. The difference between the #1 and #2 films is $135M, so Endgame was the only choice for most, it was just about how many showed up. So this could mean the film will have to 'settle' for being 'only' the second biggest domestic release of all time. There could be some hope for it to pass $900M in that schools will be getting out soon and certainly many folks have chosen to not waste 3 hours of finals study time on Avengers. Those folks are also better people than I. But Detective Pikachu is coming to solve that case and could eat into those sweet Endgame audiences.
* **Avengers: Endgame (cont.)** \- You probably were wondering when I'd get to that title, and don't worry I gotchu girl. This weekend the film crossed $2.28B worldwide which means it has passed Titanic to become the 2nd biggest film of all time. That makes it the first non-James Cameron film to pass Titanic, so damn good on you James. Also worth noting as it got there within just ten days of release, a massive achievement. As I said before the big test for this film to secure the #1 spot above Avatar is getting that crazy milestone of $2B in overseas gross. Currently the film stands at $1.56B overseas. While Detective Pikachu could easily eat into those worldwide profits (again Pokemon is the most successful media franchise worldwide) $440M extra doesn't seem that extreme to me. The film continues to be absolutely massive in China, grossing $575.8M so far. That is really the biggest factor it has over Avatar, the explosion of the Chinese market in the last ten years. Avatar was considered an unparalleled success in China at the time and do you know what its final Chinese total was? $204.1M Quite a change in a decade So it may not be guaranteed but Endgame seems on the right track to surpass the Avatar and cement James Cameron's fury for decades to come. Of course when Pikachu solves the mystery of my heart, who knows what will happen.
* **The Intruder** \- While no one even dared to come up against Endgame on its opening weekend, some figured they might just get enough table scraps as Endgame sloppily devours the four quadrant market, Enter our first and best off-contender, The Intruder, which did the most reliable and safest route one can do, cheap-ass horror movie. The film opened alright at #2 with $11M. The $8M budgeted home invasion thriller is a perfectly good Lifetime movie premise but with a more notable cast including Denis ""DDE"" Quaid. The film by Screen Gems clearly was going for cheap and quick thrills and it mostly worked, playing to an older audience with 68% over the age of 25. The film scored a weak B- though so don't expect it to stick around a ton longer or even remember it exists seconds after you finish reading this sentence. Without looking up what was the title of this movie? I bet many of you didn't even remember.
* **Long Shot** \- MORE LIKE A LONG SHOT FROM #1 AT THE BOX OFFICE. Take that Seth Rogen, you goddamn hippie! Sorry  new diet, I'm so very hungry. But for real Long Shot did not do so hot trying to be the fun romantic comedy counter-programming to the more serious romantic drama of Endgame, as Long Shot opened at #3 with $10M. While that's close to The Intruder, Long Shot also has a much higher budget, 4x as high at $40M. While the film scored good reviews from critics, it seems only your mom wanted to see Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron get freaky as 68% of the audience was over 35 and female. And the audiences that did see it weren't that into it as it scored a weak B rating on Cinemascore. Films like these need good long runs and I just don't see Long Shot doing it. Also did anyone else see that trailer before Avengers: Endgame that was a really desperate plea from Seth Rogen to see the film? That was...just kinda sad.
* **UglyDolls** \- Remember Uglydolls? No? Well then that explains why the film opened at #4 to $8.5M. The film based on the plush toy line of the same name has been in development hell for 8 years, originally to be produced by Illumination and then getting passed of to STX with Robert Rodriguez originally to direct who left to do Alita. By the time the film was finally in production the UglyDolls brand had really faded away and so it seems their new approach is, sell the shit out of the music and talent. There are so many goddamn musical artists across all kinds of genres involved in this film, with almost the entire voice cast being singers. Here's the list: Kelly Clarkson, Janelle Monae, Nick Jonas, Blake Shelton, Pitbull, Pentatonix, Why Don't We, Wang Leehom, Anitta, Bebe Rexha, Lizzo, Ice-T, and Charlie XCX. If that's not a desperate attempt to get some kind of fanbase somewhere to show up in mass, then well maybe this was just the perfect people for the roles. Try hard not to stifle your laughter at work. So far in the US this has really not worked, especially since with marketing the film needs over $100M net to break even. But with such an insane roster, I wouldn't be shocked to come back to either find this film closed to $40M worldwide or $350M because it's insanely huge in like Estonia for some singer related reason.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Avengers: Endgame** \- I mean...wow. Where to even begin. Well let's start with the basics . Avengers: Endgame, the culmination of the first major run of the most successful film franchise of all time, opened this weekend to a kind of okay, solid, a little underwhelming #1 with $350M domestic and $1.2B worldwide. So you know, it might break even. For real though that is the biggest opening ever, beating the $257.6M domestic and $640.5 worldwide opening records set by Avengers: Infinity War just last year. It beat every single opening record: biggest foreign opening, biggest opening day, biggest Friday, biggest Saturday, and biggest Sunday on the day that the most expensive TV episode of all time premiered. Not only is the first time any film has opened over $300M domestic and $1B worldwide, and not only is this now the 18th highest grossing film AFTER JUST 3 DAYS, but also this is the biggest jump up in the records ever. Previously, Star Wars: The Force Awakens had the biggest jump opening $39M more than Jurassic World and Infinity War set the international record with a jump up of $98.6M from Fate of the Furious. In context, Endgame jumped up $92.4M more domestic and $568.5M more worldwide! One last insane note, the #2 and #3 biggest worldwide openings combined is still LESS than Avengers: Endgame's worldwide opening. Absolute. Goddamn. Madness.
* **Avengers: Endgame** (cont.) - So where do we go now? Well the obvious question is of course will this finally be the film that after almost 10 years dethrones the 2009 megahit The Princess and the Frog as the biggest film ever. Oh no wait...sorry Avatar! To remind you Avatar's insane record has not even even come close to being broken, standing at $2.78B. The closest film is Titanic with $2.18B and if you count out Titanic's re-release it's The Force Awakens with $2.06B (Infinity War is a close fourth with $2.04B). So the good news for Endgame is of course this massive head start, especially in foreign sales. Yes, Avatar set the then domestic record with a huge $760M domestic but it's the still unbeatable $2B in overall worldwide gross that has made it such a long term champion. Endgame stands at $859M so far in overseas sales in just three days so getting to $2B does not seem that impossible. Domestic is even easier, as even if the film has an absolutely terrible multiplier (say 2x) it still passes $700M domestic. If it has the same multiplier as Infinity War (2.63x) it will gross over $900M. If it has a multiplier over 2.85x (a harder run but not unprecedented for the MCU) it will be the first film to cross $1B domestic and dethrone The Force Awakens $936.7M domestic record.
* **Avengers: Endgame** (cont.) - However, let's play devil's advocate for a second here about why it may not be the biggest domestic or foreign. For one MCU films do tend to have multipliers in the 2.5x - 2.75x range which would mean a truly amazing run of around $700M - $800M which is good but loses the record. Let's also note that The Force Awakens had the advantage of Christmas time on its side, tons of people with nothing to do which gave the film its incredible 39.8% second weekend drop and its even more incredible 3.77x multiplier. Endgame just doesn't have that on its side as again MCU films tend to drop a decent amount second weekend and it does have competition. Maybe I'm wrong here, but I really do feel that people are underestimating Detective Pikachu which opens in two weeks. Do you know what the single most lucrative media franchise of all time is? Not Star Wars, not the MCU, not Disney Princesses. It's Pokemon. And this is the first live action Pokemon film ever made by a major studio. It could put a serious dent in Endgame's third weekend. And there's the potential that this weekend was so big because so many wanted to avoid spoilers. Not to mention the three hour runtime, though remember the per theater average this weekend for Endgame was a record $75K.  So yeah theaters will make as much room as possible, but ultimately you only have so much time and theater space. And there's the film's somber tone which could leave some not wanting to revisit right away. Look, I'm not saying I will just be totally stunned if the film closes to $1B domestic and $3B worldwide. I'm saying don't open the champagne for that those records yet. Definitely keep it on ice though.
* **Avengers: Endgame** (cont.) - Now explaining how we got here is obvious but I'd like to quickly sum it up. When Kevin Feige bet the rights of the remaining Marvel characters they owned against the first four Marvel films, he was betting on the idea that he could use serialized storytelling to create a new kind of blockbuster. I thought The Avengers was the culmination of that idea but now looking back it was just a stepping stone. There's a moment in Endgame that only works if you've built this franchise up as well as he and the MCU team has for 11 years. This franchise is so powerful because of that patience, that understanding of story, that understanding of modern culture and what audiences want. You may despise these movies but goddamn, you have to respect them. This opening will stand for a very long time. And even if this film closes and Force Awakens and Avatar keep their all-time titles, it will still stand as the biggest achievement a producer has ever made. There's a reason so many other franchise have failed to replicate this formula. It's because it takes time, patience, risk, trial, and error. MCU has never failed fully but it very well could have along the way, a lot of times. It's truly a huge moment in cinema history to have a film this hyped still be critically acclaimed, generally loved by fans, and this big of hit. And it all happened because it features Fortnite. GOODNIGHT EVERYBODY!

**Written Reviews:**

[The Atlantic - David Sims](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/04/avengers-endgame-review-marvel/587821/)

>Of course, the story eventually shifts into epic mode, and the action has the usual bland competence of Marvel movies (something even outstanding entries like Black Panther struggled to dodge). But all the applause breaks and jaw-dropping developments only work because of the interpersonal bonds that have been strengthened over the years and that Endgame spends much of its time celebrating. After beginning with a mournful tone, the film turns goofier and livelier as the team’s wild gambit to save the world comes into focus; it’s to the Russos’ credit that they manage this transition with aplomb.

[The Chicago Sun Times - Richard Roeper](https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/avengers-endgame-review-movie-marvel-richard-roeper/)

>They saved maybe the best for the end. I’m not prepared to instantly label “Avengers: Endgame” as the best of the 23 Marvel Universe movies to date, but it’s a serious contender for the crown and it’s the undisputed champion when it comes to emotional punch. If you don’t feel the tears welling up multiple times during this screen-filling, eye-popping, time-hopping, pulse-pounding, beautifully filmed superhero adventure for the ages, check for a pulse — because you might be dead. So much hype has swirled for so long in advance of this sure-to-crack-$2-billion-worldwide insta-hit, you might have been wondering if even the combined powers of Captain Marvel, Iron Man, Black Widow, the Hulk, Captain America et al., would be strong enough to hold up under such an avalanche of expectations. Not to worry. As the popular movie saying goes: They got this.

[The Chicago Tribune - Michael Phillips](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-avengers-endgame-movie-review-0423-story.html) (SPOILERS)

>Their commercial instincts are fabulous, but the chief limitation with “Endgame” relates directly to how the Russo brothers approach the staging and composition of pure action. They’re just medium-good visual stylists, alternating fake-documentary handheld camerawork with generic glide-ins, back and forth, forth and back. They get the job done. But with so much of “Endgame” taken up with two- or three-character conversations, things occasionally become stilted because the camera doesn’t interact with the actors in any fluid or striking ways. (Also, the Alan Silvestri score pours it on, generically.)

[Collider - Matt Goldberg](http://collider.com/avengers-endgame-review/)

>Thankfully, Endgame never feels like a victory parade but a story with its own stakes and dangers. This is the landing that the MCU had to stick, and for the most part, they nail it. The movie may not really be about anything in particular, and yet its overarching theme (broad as it may be)—that it matters how you choose to live your life—still resonates thanks to the choices these characters make. Never in the movie’s three hours did I feel like I was getting cheap thrills or fan service. I felt like I was getting the final chapter in a long story before the new story begins.

[Empire - Helen O'hara](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/avengers-endgame/review/)

>This is not just about getting the gang back together, but taking the time to share knowledge, form a plan and work as a team in order to do some actual avenging for once. It’s a long film, but it doesn’t feel it even with all these talky scenes. We get a steady stream returning characters – and not just heroes – that ensure your interest never has a chance to wane: the cast of this film is a indie director’s fever dream, an embarrassment of riches that is well invested at key moments.

[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/23/avengers-endgame-review-unconquerable-brilliance-takes-marvel-to-new-heights)

>Avengers: Endgame is of course entirely preposterous and, yes, the central plot device here does not, in itself, deliver the shock of the new. But the sheer enjoyment and fun that it delivers, the pure exotic spectacle, are irresistible, as is its insouciant way of combining the serious and the comic. Without the comedy, the drama would not be palatable. Yet without the earnest, almost childlike belief in the seriousness of what is at stake, the funny stuff would not work either. As an artificial creation, the Avengers have been triumphant, and as entertainment, they have been unconquerable.

[The Hollywood Reporter - Todd McCarthy](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/avengers-endgame-review-1203971)

>Nonetheless, it's an amiable brand of melancholy that pervades the film, one that scarcely gets in the way of the enthusiasm and excitement that Marvel adventures almost always deliver in some measure or another. The feeling of finality and potential farewell is sometimes suggested quietly just in the way certain moments are lingered over, conveying the fatalistic sense that this might well be the last time around the block for some of these characters...Although there's loads of action and confrontations, what's distinctive here in contrast to most of the earlier Marvel films are the moments of doubt, regret and uncertainty, along with the desire of some characters to move on. Granted, this is almost always undercut, and/or cut short, by some emergency that pulls them right back in, and decisive action always remains paramount.

[IGN - Laura Prudom](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/23/avengers-endgame-review)

>There’s little that can be said about the film without at least alluding to its twists, but what I can say, with certainty, is that Avengers: Endgame is a marvel, both in terms of narrative scale and sheer logistical ambition. In Infinity War, Thanos spoke of the need for balance, and Endgame achieves that goal with surprising confidence. In the deft hands of screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and directors Joe and Anthony Russo, the film walks a tightrope between high drama and cathartic comedy, offering some of the darkest and most emotionally honest scenes in the history of the MCU, alongside some of the most ridiculous and sublime. There are fewer laugh-out-loud moments here than in Infinity War, but it’s certainly lighter and oftentimes more joyous than you might expect from a story that begins with the fallout from Thanos’ snap.

[Indiewire - Eric Kohn](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/avengers-endgame-review-1202127374/) (SPOILERS)

>It’s an exhausting collage that bears no resemblance to any kind of franchise filmmaking other than its own overpopulated ensemble. (The “Star Wars” expanded universe may have more characters, but never stuffed into a single scene.) More than that, this speedy arrangement of catchy exchanges and brawls feels like it was crafted with internet memes in mind. As “Endgame” sputters to the finish line, it leaves the impression of witnessing a Marvel Movie   to three hours — and 58 seconds, but trust me, they’re disposable — of unbridled fan service.

[The Los Angeles Times - Justin Chang](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-avengers-endgame-review-20190423-story.html)

>To push the contradictions still further: Despite its epic ambitions and tumescent running time, “Endgame” often feels shorter, looser and lighter on its feet than some of its Marvel brethren. That’s true at least until a cataclysmic showdown, an ensemble mash-up of inevitably staggering proportions that, like too many of the action sequences in these movies, devolves into a murky, indecipherable blur.

[The New York Times - A.O. Scott](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/movies/avengers-endgame-review.html)

>The personal and political bad blood between those two, most acute in “Captain America: Civil War,” continues to simmer, at least at first. But the mood over all is tender and comradely, touched by acute grief and the more subtle melancholy of what everyone seems to understand is the Last Big Adventure. About that adventure, I won’t say much, though it strikes me that the shape of the plot is less vulnerable to spoilage than the little winks and local surprises along the way. Those are the rewards for sitting through all those movies patiently waiting for the post-credit stingers, collecting Easter eggs while your friends were texting or your dad was napping and generally doing the unpaid labor of fandom for all these years. Was it worth it? In the aggregate, I have my doubts, but the chuckles and awws you’ll hear around you in the theater at certain moments attest to the happy sense of participation that lies at the heart of the modern fan experience. At its best — and “Endgame” is in some ways as good as it gets — the “Avengers” cosmos has been an expansive and inclusive place.

[ScreenCrush - Matt Singer](https://screencrush.com/avengers-endgame-review/)

>There are nits to pick about some of the ins and outs of the Avengers’ plan, and I doubt I will be the only one who found it odd that this movie openly mocks a film it then proceeds to steal from for the next hour or so. Still, Avengers: Endgame largely delivers exactly what its audience wants: Huge setpieces, massive stakes, inspirational speeches, the Avengers being ride-or-die besties, and emotional moments that may or may not have made me cry. (Okay, fine, made. I cried at least two times. \[Okay, fine! More than two times. I’m not made of stone like the Thing!\]) No matter what comes next from Marvel Studios, this Avengers is a gargantuan love letter to the equally enormous mythology that Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and the rest of their collaborators built — and to the generations of readers and moviegoers who truly believe in it.

[Uproxx - Mike Ryan](https://uproxx.com/hitfix/avengers-endgame-review/)

>Avengers: Endgame is, without a doubt, the most confusing and convoluted of any of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, yet it’s also unbelievably satisfying – and, yes, does act as an endpoint for many major character arcs. If you want to jump off the MCU train, well, Endgame provides a station for you to do that.

[Variety - Peter Debruge](https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/avengers-endgame-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-1203196048/) (SPOILERS)

>If “Infinity War” was billed as a must-see event for all moviegoers, whether or not they’d attended a single Marvel movie prior, then “Endgame” is the ultimate fan-service follow-up, so densely packed with pay-offs to relationships established in the previous films that it all but demands that audiences put in the homework of watching (or re-watching) a dozen earlier movies to appreciate the sense of closure it offers the series’ most popular characters.To the extent that it has all been leading up to this, no franchise in Hollywood history can rival what the Disney-Marvel alliance has wrought

[Vox - Alex Abad-Santos](https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/4/23/18512851/avengers-endgame-review-marvel-miracle)

>So it’s special that Marvel manages to achieve the seemingly impossible in Endgame: creating a movie steeped in years of lore that still manages to recapture the excitement of watching your very first Marvel experience. Endgame is a celebration of, and goodbye to, the superheroes that many of us have grown a decade older with. It’s an earnest reminder of these heroes’ ability to reflect our own feelings about what they stand for and the emotions we share with them.

[The Wrap - Alonso Duralde](https://www.thewrap.com/avengers-endgame-film-review-mcu-robert-downey-jr-chris-evans/)

>But if you enjoyed “Infinity War” because you are invested enough in these characters — and to their credit, these really are characters and not just pieces on a gameboard — to have enjoyed the interplay between people we never thought we’d see together, you’ll find that same delight here in reunions and partings, betrayals and sacrifices. There’s more than a whiff of World War II cinema here, with brave soldiers (of both genders) giving of themselves for the greater good alongside the sweethearts who will mourn them."

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **The Curse of La Llorona** \- You know no studio cares about this weekend when a franchise film is dumped without even making it clear it's a franchise movie. The sixth (and mostly unacknowledged) film in the Conjuring universe opened this weekend to a pretty good $26.5M at #1. The whole weekend was actual the worst Easter weekend since 2005 so for any film to do anything at all is a minor miracle as pretty much everyone agreed to stay home, smoke weed, eat easter candy, watch Game of Thrones, and wait for Endgame. While not advertised as such this film is part of the Conjuring universe though in such a very shoe-horned way it was likely a last minute reshoot situation. Still counts though which makes this the fifth Conjuring film to open to #1 of the six produced (only Annabelle: The First didn't manage that as it just barely lost to Gone Girl). However it was the lowest opening of the bunch, winning mostly by default on a bad wekeend The film got absolutely horrible reviews and a B- on Cinemascore so even if it wasn't coming up against A:E it would be a really tough hold. Of course it will probably not be #1 next weekend when Endgame makes (checks tracking numbers) $1 TRILLION?!
* **Breakthrough -** The Avengers of Christian movies that brings such talent as Topher Grace and that lady from This is Us opened this weekend to an okay #3 with $11.1M. The $14M film about a mom using the power of prayer to help heal her son who got real cold is fascinatingly the first ever Disney branded release of a Fox film and so far it's clear this wasn't what they paid over $50B+ for. Still that's not a terrible opening and the key with these films is all about the long game. So while most everyone of us heathens will be seeing Endgame, the true believers could keep this going as solid counter-programming. Obviously the goal being something like the run of I Can Only Imagine, which managed an impressive 4.8x multiplier last year.
* **Disney's Penguins** \- While Disney probably won't even remember this movie exists next weekend, they still had a weak attempt to recapture that mid 2000s penguin fever with their new Disneynature doc Penguins. The film opened terrible at #12 with $2.3M, the worst opening for any Disneynature doc yet. I mostly bring this film up to point out something fascinating I learned. Some folks I know in the theatrical distribution game all told me this weekend that they were allegedly forced to play Penguins in their biggest theater or else they wouldn't be allowed to show Endgame. This kind of dirty tactic is sadly pretty common for Disney. It was however a particular dumb movie this weekend when not only did some report less than 20 tickets sold for the evening shows of Penguins but they also noted a very packed group for Captain Marvel as the film gained this weekend (see below). Disney if you're going to be draconian and shitty at least be smart about it. Really, using Endgame to push an Ed Helms voiced doc? That's just...lame.

We in the Endgame now folks. Less than a week until the conclusion of Space Rocks: The Rock Opera. I know many of you are mad excited. Because of this and the need for many to talk spoilers on our sub, we are bringing back something we haven't done since The Force Awakens.

The live thread will be posted four hours after the first public showings in the world will air, in the Phillipines at around 6am their time. This thread will then conceivably pick up the first showings across the world then culminating in the release of the big official discussion when the last initial showings finish. This official discussion will be the main hub for all discussions of Endgame. The live thread will be linked to but not prioritized. **Remember we will remove all other discussions of Endgame when the official discussions is new**. So be sure to put all your crazy theories and thoughts in there. Remember there's also /r/marvelstudios, but they also are keeping all their discussions in one or two threads.

So the Endgame live thread will post April 23rd, 21:00 (-5:00 GMT). That timezone is also known as CDT. Then we will post the official discussion on April 25th, 22:00 (-5:00 GMT). As you may note that is an hour later than usual to account for the film's extended run time and the likely 8 billion trailers that will play before it.

One other thing to mention, for some reason reddit threads that hit over 100k comments start to get screwy and not allow new responses. Because of this we lock those threads and create new ones. We will almost certainly have to do that here, so if that happens the second official discussion will post May 2nd, 21:00 (-5:00 GMT) or May 9th, 21:00 (-5:00 GMT) depending on when those numbers hit 100k. Of course if it happens even sooner we'll do it sooner.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Shazam!** \- While the weekend was lead by an exclamation mark it was one of the more dull weekends of the year. Ss we enter the pre-Avengers doldrums we see how hard it is to compete with even pre-sales of the massive film as while Shazam did maintain #1 it did so on weak weekend, coming in with $25.1M. Of the four new releases, two didn't even make the top 5 and Shazam's main competition, Hellboy, completely fell apart. All that in mind the 53% drop for the film on its second weekend is not a great sign for a film that opened low and was hoping to ride that A rating on Cinemascore for a great three weekends in a row. As it continues to struggle internationally the film really needed to pick up steam domestically but it seems while critics and audiences like the film there's just no push to go see it right. Of course as mentioned we are past Endgame breaking the pre-sale ticket records and even worse the final season of Game of Thrones began on Sunday and looks to eat into five more straight weeks of box office. But more than that there's just not the right energy around Shazam. This should be the fun early summer movie to rally people around but it seems unlikely to get anywhere near the healthy long run it needs, even to justify its lower than normal $100M budget.
* **Little -** Don't call your movie Little! What are you, demanding for puns from hack box office writers? Anyways Little didn't even make enough or lose enough for a decent pun as it opened fine at #2 with $15.4M. The film is your classic body swap comedy, this time focusing on a black woman (Regina Hall) in the adult who's gotta be a kid to learn a lesson role. Hollywood's gone hard for black female led comedies post Girls Trip, evidenced that this almost Big remake follows the direct black female led remake What Men Want which happened to close the same week. Body swap comedies aren't big money openers, so what you want is a Freaky Friday (2003) situation where you open to $22.2M but end with $110M. Little is very unlikely to pull that off but as the only notable counter-programming slate for a while as it has absolutely no direct comedy competition until The Hustle opens in May. The film was not well received critically but it did get an okay B+ rating on Cinemascore which may mean a decent run. It's really more seeing if the core audience returns and brings friends but as of now with a $20M budget this seems like a decent earning programmer that we will all forget existed in like...what was I talking about?
* **Hellboy (2019)** \- Somewhere right now Guillermo del Toro has a sly grin on his face as he reads the trades that the reboot to his Hellboy film franchise, called very creatively Hellboy, has totally bombed opening at #3 with $12M. This is reddit so I don't need to relitigate this whole thing so here's the brief summary of the Hellboy '19 saga. Guillermo del Toro's big passion project in the mid 2000s was the Hellboy franchise, a series of two films based on the popular comic book of the same name starring Ron Perlman as the big red boi. Hellboy 1 was a financial disappointment but growing interest from TV streams got a more flashy second film produced. That film opened well and was very well received but had horrendous scheduling. It opened the week before the #1 film on /r/movies all years running list, The Dark Knight. It dropped 70% the second week and GDT spent the next decade trying to get a third made to no success. While he was promoting his Best Picture winner The Lady From Paddington Gets it On With a Fish it was announced with major surprise that Hellboy was to be rebooted with David Harbor replacing Perlman and Neil Marhsall taking the role of director. The film was to be a gory R-rated tribute to the comics. And then everything went wrong.
* **Hellboy (2019) (cont.)** \- [The Wrap wrote a fantastic piece](https://www.thewrap.com/hellboy-david-harbour-neil-marshall/) on the troubled Hellboy shoot and it's quite a ride. Essentially the film was a nightmare shoot, a constant battle between a horror director wanting to make a dark movie versus a studio who wanted their own Deadpool. The film's budget faced a massive downgrade from the previous entry, from $85M to $50M. And the results were not too pleasant. The film was trashed by critics and got a C rating on Cinemascore. The film had the worst wide release opening for a comic book adaptation since 2014's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. And it seems no one involved in the production or out of it left happy. It all reminds me so much of The Predator from last year, a hobbled mess where a person who's made great work in genre before cannot face the battles of studio mandates and maybe his own self-interests. While I certainly think the terrible reviews hurt the opening it's also a sign of just how bad an idea the reboot was to begin with. Not only did it piss off a major talent who just won Best Director, it annoyed fans of the original who likely stayed away. And it showed that Hellboy still is a very cult figure and selling people on seeing him with taglines like ""Legendary AF"" is a difficult task. This isn't to say a GDT directed Hellboy 3 would have faired better box office wise, but at least one person would have won a cinematic battle instead of seemingly no one.
* **After** \- What a world we live in where reworked fan fiction has become the new money maker. Thanks Fifty Shades you broke the world. Well at least this time it didn't work as After, which no joke is based on One Direction fan fiction, flopped opening at #8 with $6.2M. The film however is doing better overseas with a worldwide total of $18.5M. On a budget of $14M the film doesn't have to do a lot to get to profitability, especially since the film was mostly target marketed on social media sites like Instagram and YouTube (I know this old man hadn't heard of it until he made the official discussion thread). However its very existence has brought up some rather odd issues, like does a fan fiction based on a real person that then changes the names count as some form of personal slander or copyright infringement? I'm clearly no smarty smart lawyer but I can say this trend will eventually bite someone in the ass somewhere. After is too small scale to be the test case but I can't imagine Scar Jo will like my new film project about famed actor turned goth vampire hunter Jar Sco.
* **Missing Link** \- Oh poor Laika. The company is trying to keep stop motion animated films alive with well reviewed insanely detailed works and the thanks they get is one of the worst wide release openings of all time as Missing Link opened to a dismal #9 with $5.8M. That's the 11th worst opening for a film in over 3,000 theaters, being beaten by such classics as The Darkest Minds and Show Dogs. While I think the general public disinterest in stop motion is what has kept some of their films in the past from succeeding this time I place the blame solely on the utter lack of marketing. The film was barely marketed and many people I know who are Laika fans didn't even know the film existed when it came out this weekend. This is the first Laika film release by United Artists instead of Focus and there is a clear lack of engagement from them on this film or at very least a poorly managed release strategy. Not that I ever saw this film, which got decent reviews but feels like a modest follow-up to the epic scope of their previous film Kubo and the Two Strings, doing incredibly well but with such an awful opening any good will is moot. For once this is actually a company I do want bought up by Disney just to keep them safe. Oh what's that Disney has bought Laika and they are making them do a stop motion animated BB-8 movie? What have I wrought?!

**Metacritic:** [34/100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hellboy-2019)

**Written Reviews:**

[The A.V. Club - Katie Rife](https://film.avclub.com/neil-marshalls-hellboy-is-a-loud-gory-mess-only-a-teen-1833944764)

>In typical fairy-tale fashion, Guillermo del Toro’s 2004 film version of Mike Mignola’s comics series framed the demon-turned-demon hunter through the lens of a lovesick teenager. The new reboot of the franchise also approaches Hellboy from an adolescent point of view, but with a distinct variation on the concept: This is the sneering form of the word frequently lobbed at Transformers movies, the kind that prioritizes guitar riffs, sarcastic one-liners, and blustering tumbleweeds of CGI creatures wrestling each other.

[Birth.Movies.Death - Leigh Monson](https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2019/04/10/hellboy-review-shut-the-hell-up)

>It’s an engaging conflict, but not enough time or energy is spent on making these characters likable or interesting to justify the attempted nuance. The editing is a haphazard mess, but the plot feels like such a hack job from what must have been an unreasonably longer cut that I can’t really fault the effort to bring this down to size. It certainly doesn’t help, though, that there are some very obvious post-production additions in the works here, from jokes added in ADR that land with a resounding thud to metal riff soundtrack choices that desperately want you to think this is the next Guardians of the Galaxy. I can assure you that it is not.

[The Chicago Tribune - Katie Walsh](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-hellboy-david-harbour-movie-review-0411-20190410-story.html)

>With this noisy, fast, chaotic ""Hellboy,"" Marshall is at his most cheeky and most unhinged. It's certainly… a lot. Harbour is an ideal choice to sport the crown of sawed-off horns as the demon with a heart of gold, an investigator working for his father (Ian McShane) at the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. Harbour has a warmth and humor that shines through all the prosthetics, and an ease with sarcastic wisecracks too. The snarky asides, which permeate even the solemn voice-over that opens the film (which starts in yes, the 5th century, with yes, King Arthur), let us know everyone here is in on the joke. It's OK to laugh with the movie, even if it feels like we're laughing at it.

[Forbes - Scott Mendelson](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/04/10/review-hellboy-fails-for-same-reasons-as-fantastic-four-amazing-spider-man-incredible-hulk/#60b5f261f96d)

>To use the most cliché of all Shakespeare quotes, Hellboy is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. It is filled to the grim with ghoulish sights, horrific violence, punishing (if deeply unpoetic) action and unapologetic (if arbitrary) fantasy elements. That’s on its face, a good thing. I imagine some will (no judgment) enjoy Hellboy purely for what it contains. But the story is a mishmash of barely comprehensible jumble, held together only by an expository prologue and a character arc cribbed from the first Hellboy movie and thematics borrowed from The Golden Army.

[The Hollywood Reporter - John DeFore](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/hellboy-review-1201048)

>But Neil Marshall's Hellboy isn't lousy because nobody wants it, nor only because it fails to live up to both its big-screen and its printed predecessors. It's just lousy. Bloated, vastly less funny than it aims to be and misguided in key design choices even when it scores with less important decisions, the film does make bold choices that might've paid off under other circumstances. But these aren't those circumstances.

[IGN - Meg Downey](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/10/hellboy-reboot-review)

>Add to the clutter of the plot some truly embarrassing CGI--and virtually all of it is CGI, there are maybe two practical effects in the movie outside of Harbour's costume and makeup--and you've got a real recipe for disaster. There's really no other way to say it: the movie looks cheap. Sometimes there's the sense that cheap is what it was going for--there's a certain sort of Army of Darkness-flavored B-movie sensibility to a handful of scenes--but the gags and the jokes never land well enough to actually sell the self-awareness. Other scenes and characters just look downright dated, to the point where the terribly green-screened edges and horribly rendered monsters actually seem distracting.

[Indiewire - Eric Kohn](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/hellboy-review-a-bloodier-sillier-remix-guillermo-del-toro-1202057594/)

>A bloodier, sillier remix of the earlier entries in this unlikely franchise, “Hellboy” swaps Perlman for “Stranger Things” detective David Harbour, whose large frame and snarky posturing on that show was basically a Ron Perlman homage, anyway. Harbour makes for a formidable Hellboy in a visually snappy milieu that, like del Toro’s earlier entries, takes its cues from Mignola’s sardonic horror-fantasy universe. There’s plenty to enjoy about the latest absurdist odyssey, which finds Hellboy grappling with his sinister origin amidst some Arthurian gobbledygook about the coming apocalypse. However,Marshall works so hard to make the zany underworld-gone-wild formula entertaining when the entertainment value is already baked into the material. All that eager wackiness has a breaking point.

[The Los Angeles Times - Justin Chang](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hellboy-review-20190410-story.html)

>Perhaps the best defense that can be mustered in support of Marshall’s “Hellboy” is that the director’s affection for the material is no less real or exuberant than Del Toro’s; it’s just a lot more crudely, monotonously expressed. The movie seems to spring from a curious awareness of how unnecessary it is, and it responds in the manner of an uninvited guest, with no interest in behaving or ingratiating itself. We are hurled, with a rude but fitting lack of ceremony, into a smorgasbord of R-rated horror and fantasy conventions, replete with weird detours into Arthurian legend, Mayan mythology and Slavic folklore, and rendered in the director’s preferred visual idiom of disemboweled corpses and beautifully art-directed entrails.

[Slashfilm - Josh Spiegel](https://www.slashfilm.com/hellboy-review/)

>In a word, Hellboy is unpleasant. Other appropriate adjectives to describe this reboot include dreadful, obnoxious, unnecessary, and interminable. Considering the shadow cast by the two Hellboy films written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, it might be easy to presume that this new version simply pales in comparison. Though that’s true, let’s not belabor the point: this Hellboy is quite bad all on its own. There’s no need to compare this to del Toro’s films, because to do so would just inspire pain.

[Uproxx - Vince Mancini](https://uproxx.com/hitfix/hellboy-review/)

>Did it need to exist? Probably not. Am I glad it does? Absolutely. Will it be a movie people yell at me in six months for loving? …Possibly. Exuberantly gross and proudly ridiculous, this Hellboy feels like the picture Glenn Danzig sees in his head when he doodles in his notebook.

[Variety - Owen Glieberman](https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/hellboy-review-david-harbour-1203184127/)

>That’s true of the movie as well. It’s lunging to be a badass hard-R epic, but it’s basically a pile of origin-story gobbledygook, frenetic and undercooked, full of limb-hacking, eye-gouging monster battles as well as an atmosphere of apocalyptic grunge that signifies next to nothing. Playing Hellboy, David Harbour has a tough act to follow and does well, but the real tough act to follow is del Toro’s.

[The Washington Post - Alan Zilberman](https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/the-hellboy-reboot-has-more-gore-and-profanity-than-the-original-that-doesnt-make-it-better/2019/04/10/bde80b08-5105-11e9-88a1-ed346f0ec94f_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.46033a02c908)

>Sometimes “more adult” does not mean “more mature.” That’s the central problem facing “Hellboy,” the reboot of the comic book character popularized in films by Guillermo del Toro. The original 2004 movie and its 2008 sequel were PG-13 affairs, with a focus on the demonic antihero’s lovable streak. Under the direction of Neil Marshall, a filmmaker with his own horror/fantasy bona fides, this Hellboy curses, eviscerates, flays and disembowels. Marshall and screenwriter Andrew Cosby went overboard with their R-rating, introducing so much gore and profanity that it, quite frankly, gets dull. The flat performances and incoherent story do not help matters.

[The Wrap - William Bibbiani](https://www.thewrap.com/hellboy-movie-review-2019-david-harbour/)

>Marshall’s “Hellboy” is a horrifyingly good time. It captures the breathless quality of reading 30 issues of a single comic-book series in one sugar-addled afternoon, shoving as many amazing characters and storylines and images into one film as it can possibly hold. It could have seemed overstuffed and frenetic, but this new “Hellboy” instead comes across as imaginative and freewheeling. Even the shocking violence is fun and humorous, harkening back to the good old days of splatstick horror classics like the “Evil Dead” and “Waxwork” movies."

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Shazam!** \- The latest from what I am just going to call New DC opened at #1 this week with a solid if franchise low opening of $53.4M at #1. We are definitely at a fascinating moment in superhero films, as we approach the culmination of the decade that was defined by the MCU, while the once big boys of the industry DC struggle to figure out what their identity even is. Shazam is an odd duck, a $100M lower stakes family friendly fun superhero who still is kinda sort of part of the same dark and grim universe of BvS and Justice League. This could explain the odd mismatch of a very well reviewed superhero film opening lower than I'd imagine WB would like. Still this isn't a bad opening, far above the potential $40M it looked like it could hit going into the weekend which spoke in many ways to the positive word of mouth of the film exemplified by the fantastic A rating on Cinemascore the film got. Shazam has a good three weekends of runway before Endgame chews up the box office and poops out $100M weekends for the next month. Which is promising for Shazam because internationally things are not so hot.
* **Shazam!** **(cont.)** \- The film opened to $100M worldwide which is solid but nowhere near the level of a big tentpole superhero film needs to be at. In many places the film has suffered from just a general lack of interest, especially a very disappointing $30M debut in China. So again what we are looking at is that good ol' box office term, legs. In China the film seems already done, getting pretty weak reviews from the local audience. But elsewhere it's harder to say and it seems that domestic is the best chance for a Shazam 2: Shazamaloo. The $100M budget is an odd one, not small stakes enough like Joker (the next experiment from New DC) or big enough to justify a huge worldwide roll-out. But it also means comparisons are hard. The closest parallel might be Ant-Man and if that's the case a $400M final total for the film could be enough, especially if a large portion of that is domestic which goes more towards the studios than foreign gross. And again WB has a well liked film that is connecting with an audience with sequel potential. So if the interest is there all they have to do is quickly make a sequel that is just as good and enjoyable as the original. No pressure /u/dauid!
* **Pet Sematary (2019)** \- The Return of the (Stephen) King has been an interesting one to follow and now we have a possible dip in that resurgence, as the reboot of the 1989 cult classic and one of King's most notorious novels opened this weekend to a good but not great $25M at #2. Now in classic horror movie fashion this already covers the $21M budget for the film, but is a far shot from the insane $123.4M opening of the last King theatrical release, It. As we approach the release of the much anticipated follow-up to that film and following the release of the Kingaverse show Castle Rock you'd think that King fever had swept the nation, but it seems such reports were a bit exaggerated. The funny thing is until about 5 years ago when horror openings just exploded this opening would have been viewed as a big success. But now Us opens to almost 3x this and isn't based on a popular King novel so it feels a little underwhelming. There's also the matter of the fascinating track of reviews for the film. Out of SXSW the film was hailed as a fresh update but since then then Metascore has dropped from 76 to 58. Audiences were definitely not fond of the film, slapping it with a C+ on Cinemascore, so expect a big ol drop next weekend. So yes for Paramount this isn't terrible but it's not the next It and one now wonders if even It: Chapter 2 is the next It. The new horror landscape is one that is increasingly favoring original IPs like Us and A Quiet Place, and perhaps remakes of stories we already know aren't scaring us as much any more. Too bad because the post credit scene where Jack Torrance invites the zombie cat into the Tommyknockers Initiative was really exciting, but I guess that may not happen now.
* **Dumbo (2019)** \- Last Monday fell on April 1st so I made this post a parody of myself (""but I thought that was just how you always are huehuehue"") so I figured I'd owe you a semi more serious take on the big release of last week. Dumbo opened to a pretty underwhelming $45.9M last weekend, the 3rd worst opening of the current Disney remake trend (only ahead of Pete's Dragon and Alice through the Looking Glass) and is faltering worldwide, just now passing $200M. This weekend was even harsher to the little elephant with Tim Burton spooky clown makeup as it dropped a massive 60.4% to end up at #3 with $18.2M. This is really bad news for Disney...if Disney wasn't planning on making a shit ton of money in the coming year. Still this could end up being a $100M+ loss for the company and proof that just because it's a Disney live action remake doesn't mean it will assuredly print cash. Unless it's called The Lion King.
* **Captain Marvel** \- The little $152M movie that could just passed $1B worldwide as Captain Marvel became the 7th MCU film to pass that milestone. Hell let's just point out this is the 7th MCU to pass that milestone this decade and the 3rd in just two years with a certain fourth coming in less than a month. Also worth noting that Captain Marvel is only the third superhero origin film to pass $1B and the first where the protagonist did not appear in a previous film (both Aquaman and Black Panther appeared in previous films before their $1B debut film). It's a very impressive turnout for the first time appearance of a character and proof that MCU's grip on global market is insanely high as they approach Endgame. This decade has been insanely good to Marvel and it's still not even over yet. But hey, good start right?
* **The Best of Enemies** \- Oh STX god bless ya, you're trying. The studio attempt to get in on that sweet sweet Green Book money did not go so well as the biopic opened to a fairly low $4.5M at #6. While the film was in less than 2,000 theaters it still had a pretty weak $2,639 per theater average. The film tells the true story of Ann Atwater, a civil rights leader, and C. P. Ellis, a KKK leader, working together in an unlikely you get the rest. The film was clearly a wanna-be Oscar play but after the festivals went gaga for Viggo eating folded pizza the film just fell by the wayside and ended up in April, a pretty common dumping ground for Oscar players that went nowhere. As expected it didn't find much purchase, which is too bad as it did score an A on Cinemascore which showed the same audience that pushed Green Book past $80M domestic may have liked this too. But alas little interest does not a good box office run make. However don't think Hollywood is done, especially after Green Book's win. Seriously if you have some inspiring story about a black and white person getting along in the old days, you better sell the shit out of that story right now. That stock is hot hot hot.

* **PROGRAMMING NOTE -** Just a quick note I want to address [the recent news](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/b83pau/a_welcome_note_to_our_new_friends_the_walt_disney/) of the purchase of /r/movies by Disney Co. While I am excited to now be paid to make these write-ups I understand the concern that a major producer of theatrical films is in charge. I want to make it very clear I negotiated complete control over my content with Disney and in no way will feature bias for their films. I will continue giving you my own personal opinions despite who's writing my checks. Okay let's do it
* **Dumbo (2019) -** In a shocking display, Dumbo opened to an incredible #1 with $45M. This broke records becoming the 5th highest debut for a March Disney live-action release, the 25th best debut for a film with a CGI lead (almost beating Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel), and destroying as the biggest debut ever for a movie about a smart elephant (I think, there's not a box office mojo chart about that). In comparison with other major programmers with hearty and audience beloved debuts like Nutcracker and the Four Realms ($20.3M) and Wrinkle in Time ($33.1M). Now this may sound like a major downgrade from the $116M that the last Burton directed Disney live-action remake, 2010's Alice in Wonderland, made but let's also note that both got an A- on Cinemascore and the joy of an audience is what really counts. It's also worth noting the original Dumbo is 10 years older than the original Alice in Wonderland so inflation really evens it out.
* **Us -** I guess it's worth mentioning that the $20M horror film had another whatever weekend where it made $33.6M, crossing over $125M domestic. Sure that all sounds impressive but let's see Universal try to sell Tethered Lupita action figures and novelty scissors at Target. Yeah, good luck.
* **Unplanned** \- I have a statement I need to read: *We at the Disney Corp do not engage in serious political and moral debates such as presented in the film Unplanned. We believe in everyone's right to express themselves and we invite you all to remember that Galaxy's Edge, the exciting new Star Wars land in Disney World and Disney Land where no one ever talks about abortion.*

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Us -** It seems that despite having a title that is impossible to Google (and also to torrent in the near future) the much anticipated second feature from Jordan Peele opened to a massive #1 with $70.2M. That's the biggest opening ever for an original horror film and is the third highest horror opening overall only falling below It ($123.4M) and Halloween '18 ($76.2M).  If that wasn't enough, Is is actually the biggest opening for an original live action film since Avatar in 2009. 
* **Us (cont.)** - That's pretty damn remarkable for just the second feature from a director, let alone an original IP with a wild premise. This opening definitely speaks to where Peele is culturally as he jumped from hit sketch comedian to major influencer with Get Out's $250M box office run and eventual Oscar win. This combined with a well advertised Twilight Zone remake with Peele in the Rod Serling role as showrunner/host means the man is very present right now and people are very invested in him as a brand. It's perhaps no surprise then that Us more than doubled the $33.3M opening of Get Out, but now the question is will it maintain?
* **Us (cont.)** \- Review wise the film scored similarly good reviews to Get Out but Us scored worse on Cinemascore, a B rating to the A- of Get Out. Now it should be noted that for horror a B is actually pretty solid, as many acclaimed horror films like The VVitch and Hereditary got a C or D rating. But it does show that perhaps the more surreal and less obvious themes of Us means it's not the same kind of crowd pleaser as Get Out. And let's not forget that Get Out had incredible word of mouth, with it dropping just 15% on its second weekend and dropped less than 40% for 7 straight weeks. Already we are seeing a difference as Get Out actually gained on its first Saturday and dropped very little on Sunday while Us had drops on both of those days.
* **Us (cont.)** \- But of course we can't even consider the most drastic drop until we actually get to next weekend, although Us does face tough competition with Shazam which is coming in with excellent reviews as well. Whatever sophomore slumps this film may or may not have it's still another critical darling that far outperformed its $20M budget and if Peele continues to play in this scale he will certainly have massive control and influence for years to come. So now the question is what will be the next pronoun named horror hit after the massive success of It and Us. A remake of Them? A film version of You? My new terrifying possessive pronoun horror movie trilogy: Mine, Yours, and Ours?

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Captain Marvel -** Once again seems like that protest of Captain Marvel is going just fantastic as the film dropped 54.8% to come in #1 again with $69.3M. In all seriousness that hold is just fine, better than the 56% average MCU second weekend drop but definitely not as good as Black Panther's 44.7% drop so seems like we have a very classic MCU film run ahead for this film domestically. This week it passed $250M domestic and now has its eyes set on a $400M+ domestic run by the end. Worldwide the film continues to do incredibly well, passing $750M as it rockets towards $1B. That overseas success has mostly been lead by a massive $132M in China but also $36.5M in South Korea and $30.9M in the UK. It will be an interesting fight for #1 next weekend as Us, the highly anticipated follow-up to Get Out from director Jordan Peele, hits theaters with a possible $40M opening which should top CM unless it has a better drop or Us underperforms. Either way CM is unquestionably a hit, now it just has to define how big of a hit it will be.
* **Wonder Park -** Did you know Wonder Park doesn't have a credited director? Last year the director of the animated film Dylan Brown was fired for sexual misconduct allegations and they never could settle on a new director credit so it...just doesn't have one. That should speak to what a mess this production which opened to a weak #2 with $16M. The film was produced by Nickelodeon Pictures under the Paramount Animation brand and received pretty negative reviews for feeling like a very expensive pilot to a TV show, which it turns out is true! Nickelodeon is releasing a Wonder Park show in the fall and this was intended as a huge debut for what they want to become their next big brand, a la Spongebob. If that's the case then this is just a complete disaster, especially considering the film carries a budget of $100M. There could be enough juice here to give the film a counter-programming run but with such a low opening and a B+ Cinemascore rating it has a lot of trouble ahead. As it stands to me this is exactly how you don't try to create a new brand, especially as Cartoon Network and Disney have found much better success with it's new properties like Steven Universe and Star vs The Forces of Evil that debut you know as shows instead of movies in 3,000 theaters. Making a $100M pilot just feels not wonderparkful strategy...I dunno this movie is so dull even jokes about it stink.
* **Five Feet Apart -** Oh sick lit, you are a problematic genre but boy have you become a strange but stable economy at the box office. The latest in this genre is Five Feet Apart which opened solid at #3 with $13.1M. For those who don't know, sick lit refers to a new YA genre about teens falling in love despite one or both of the protagonists having a chronic illness, in this case both of the leads having cystic fibrosis. This one bucked the trend of previous sick lit hits like Everything, Everything and The Fault in Our Stars (bless poppa sick lit) by being an original IP written directly for the screen. While nothing will top the Avengers of sick lit openings TFIOS this was a better opening that E,E which shows that it could be more the genre itself running the show than the fans of the source material. With a budget of just $7M and a great A rating on Cinemascore this one should manage a solid profit and keep this unique genre going. Now I'm off to pitch my new YA genre, refugee-lit. Oh what's that, I've been cancelled. Makes sense, bye everyone!
* **Captive State -** Hmmm this is strange, I'm seeing that Captive State was a movie that was in fact released when all evidence points to it [just being a cool poster](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyNjU0NTAxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTc4MDIzNjM@._V1_SY1000_CR0,0,674,1000_AL_.jpg). Weird, I guess they quickly made a movie out of the poster premise which was released this week to a terrible #7 with $3.1M domestic. In comparison, No Manches Frida 2, a film entirely in Spanish released in 1/4th of the screens as CS, beat it coming in a #6 with $3.8M. CS's opening is the 7th worst opening for any film opening in 2,500+ theaters. So what happened to a film with an interesting premise, a successful director, and a solid cast? Well for one clearly other than the bang-up poster crew the marketing was not there at all. I personally never saw a single trailer in the theater or TV spot or YouTube ad, and I'm the target demo af. And there's likely the possibility Focus Features knew they had a real stinker on their hands as the film got savaged by critics and scored a terrible C- rating on Cinemascore. There's not much more to say here other than stop making bad sci-fi movies in hopes Netflix will buy them. That well seems to be drying up guys.

**Summary:**

Stella Grant is every bit a seventeen-year-old...she's attached to her laptop and loves her best friends. But unlike most teenagers, she spends much of her time living in a hospital as a cystic fibrosis patient. Her life is full of routines, boundaries and self-control - all of which is put to the test when she meets an impossibly charming fellow CF patient named Will Newman. There's an instant flirtation, though restrictions dictate that they must maintain a safe distance between them. As their connection intensifies, so does the temptation to throw the rules out the window and embrace that attraction. Further complicating matters is Will's potentially dangerous rebellion against his ongoing medical treatment.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Captain Marvel -** Captain Marvel has a fantastic opening at #1 with $153M domestic and $455M worldwide! That's pretty goddamn fantastic (notice my tactful non-use of a synonym for fantastic btw) on numerous levels so let's break it down! Domestically that puts it as the highest opening ever for a female superhero film. Okay now frankly the only real competition there was Wonder Woman but beating her opening by $50M is still quite impressive, especially since I would argue WW culturally is more well known than La Capitana Marvela. It is also the second highest opening ever for a superhero origin story. While it didn't come close to the insane $200M+ opening of current champion Black Panther it is notable that BP had a full intro and storyline in CA: Civil War while Captain Marvel's pre-solo film origins were...a pager. A space pager!  Internationally it's even more impressive, as CM opened to the 6th biggest worldwide opening in history. That actually far out paces Black Panther by $80M and is a higher worldwide opening than the first two Avengers films, Batman v Superman, and The Last Jedi. It is in fact the second biggest superhero opening worldwide under Infinity War. So where did all that sweet Disney capital come from? Well, China of course, which gave up $89M to the sexy super space saiyan...spilot. But the film also had massive pulls in the UK ($16.8M), Brazil ($13.4M), Mexico ($12.8M), and Australia ($10.7M). So of course now the question remains, how long before a Goose spinoff? Oh and will it make $1B?
* **Captain Marvel (cont.) -** In direct comparison I think it's good to look at other Phase 3 MCU origin stories. Of course the gold standard is Black Panther which had a drop of just 44% on its second weekend and ended with an incredible 3.4x multiplier. But on the scarier side you have something like Spider-man: Homecoming which dropped a significant 62.2% on its second weekend and ended with a 2.8x multiplier which while not bad is more in line with classic MCU standards. On the advantage side the newness and cultural relevancy of the film which pushed the crazy long runs of BP and WW (4x multiplier) could hit CM. On the bad side while it does have a great A on Cinemascore so did Homecoming and the audience was older than most MCU films with 64% over the age of 25 so it could run out of steam quicker than expected. If that's the case then we are looking at around $400M domestic whereas it could potential hold all the way over $500M. But I think even with lower numbers this has huge potential for $1B. 3 of the 5 films that are listed below CM on the all time worldwide openings list made over $1B so it's definitely in the money-making zone (also the name of my Patreon rip-off company).
* **Captain Marvel (cont.) -** Ultimately this was a damn good move for Marvel. Being a throwback film, having one of your main stars a CGI de-aged character, going back to the old format of the origin story is the first appearance of a character, and being pro flerken is all very unique. While I wouldn't say risky it is at least a little bold for them to shoulder so much of apparently large elements of Endgame on this gamble. This wasn't shooting for three from downtown but it's still a solid three. It also begins in full the great heralded Mouse House New Age when the Disney economy becomes the 5th largest GDP in the world....ok google. Where do I cash my shill checks? What do you mean you are stuck on text to speech. SHIT.

2,Feed (2005) was a real stomach churner It is one of the grossest movies i have watched. That is an extreme fetish and it is really dangerous. The concept was pretty interesting and the aussie movie was unique. Disturbing and stylish horror. It makes you want to vomit and not overeat. You have to be really messed up to be turned on by that. Alex o'loughlin was terrifying in it. Any other movies like it?
2,"Crash (1996) was weird and arousing It was a messed up movie but i would expect nothing less from the great david cronenberg. He always makes interesting and intense movies. I understood the appeal of having sex in cars but getting aroused by car crashes is another story. James spader is a powerhouse. Rosanna arquette, elias koteas, holly hunter and deborah kara unger were nice additions too. Makes you want to have sex in cars. Any other movies like it?"
2,"John Wick 3 was all over the place As much as i love keanu reeves, it was pretty clunky. The fight sequences was pretty cool and the cinematography was amazing. There was a lot going on and it really dragged on. Halle berry was a nice addition. Thought she would have a bigger role though. Asia kate dillon is pretty interesting. Still a fun action movie."
2,"The East was Fascinating Brit marling is a darling. She makes unique and meaningful movies. I enjoyed the sound of my voice and another earth. They are trying to stick up for the planet and make big polluting companies accountable. They also make dangerous drugs and only care about profit. It was about an underground activist, anarchist and ecologist organization that launches attacks against corrupt corperations. Pretty stellar cast too. Any other movies like it?"
2,Enter the Void put me in a head spin Gasper noe makes some really weird movies with meaning. They have depth and substance. This movie was pretty messed up. Not messed up as his other movies but still pretty crazy. You shouldn't watch it if you are prone to seizures. Those flashing lights are no joke. Made me dizzy and uncomfortable. That is his style. It was interesting to find out he does not speak english and needed help with the cast. Any other movies like it?
2,Lovelace was an interesting biopic I didn't know much about linda lovelace. Just heard about deepthroat. She lived a crazy life and i felt bad for her. All that abuse and degradation. The pornographic industry is intense. Her husband chuck is scum. Peter sarsgaard is good at playing unlikable characters. Haha i thought he was related to the skarsgard family but he is not. Just a similar name. Amanda seyfried was a nice surprise. Any other movies like it?
2,All About Nina was a breath of fresh air Mary elizabeth winstead delivered a powerful performance as a comedian. It is one of the toughest gigs out there. I've been waiting for her to make it big. Hope this movie gets more exposure. It was raw and relentless. Some scenes were pretty heavy and a lot to take in. Amazing directional debut from eva vives. Parts of it were based on her experiences. Any other movies like it?
2,American Animals was a different kind of heist movie It was a true story and it had the real people in it. I have seen my fair share of heist movies but this was different. I don't even know why they did it. You do stupid things when you are young i guess.  It really went under the radar. Barry keoghan always plays weird and mysterious characters. Good to see evan peters again. Any other movies like it?
2,"Sexy Beast was weird For some reason i thought it was a fighting/boxing movie. I remember seeing the dvd cover with sir ben kinglesy boxing. Sir ben kingsley was terrifying. It was a nice surprise seeing gandhi in a different light. It was a different kind of british gangster movie. It was stylish, crude and it had a killer script. Ray winstone was good as a bloated retired gangster. Any other movies like it?"
2,Melancholia was Deeply Depressing I'm starting to thing lars is a really depressed guy and has a lot of issues. The cinematography was breathtaking and the story was intriguing. The acting was phenomenal. Kirsten dunst was amazing. Bonus points for the killer body. Her best role and she was unlucky not to get nominated for an oscar. Surprised to see tough guy kiefer sutherland in it but he was good. Any other movies like it?
2,"Dancer in The Dark was Deeply Depressing I know lars von trier is a terrible person but he makes some bleak movies. Bjork was cute and bizarre. She brought innocence and sweetness to her role. I feel sorry for her, lars is abusive and intimidating. I don't really like musicals but this movie touched me. It was so sad and it really affected the way i see the world. Losing your vision is pretty much a death sentence in itself. Any other movies like it?"
2,"Defiance (2008) was an epic ww2 movie It really went under the radar. Daniel craig, liev schriber and jamie bell were amazing as brothers trying to survive the holocaust. Alexa davalos and mia wasikowska were great too. They built a community in the forest of belarus. It was an interesting movie based on true events. Those were scary times. The attention to detail was amazing. The accents were a bit iffy but i still enjoyed it. Any other movies like it?"
2,The Gift(2000) was Spooky It is visually stunning and has an amazing cast. Cate blanchett is one of the best and she put in another strong performance. Keanu reeves was chilling and repulsive. A completely different role for him. Hilary swank was good too. Giovanni ribisi is very underrated. He was really spectacular. Good to see peak katie holmes in all her glory. Also jk simmons was a nice addition. Any other movies like it?
2,I am Mother was a Pleasant Surprise I thought it would be boring but it turned out great. It really makes you think about life and the choices you make. A solid sci-fi/ end of the world movie. Clara rugaard was amazing. She has depth. Rose byrne and hilary swank were nice additions too. Pretty cool that it was filmed in australia. I hope they make a sequel. There is more to explore. Any other movies like it?
2,Zero Dark Thirty was Intense Hope jessica chastain can finally win an oscar. She always plays strong female characters and carries the movie. She has been in a few good movies and she always shines through. It had such a stacked cast. The torture scenes were brutal. The hunt for osama bin laden took many years. The cinematography and story were amazing. Kathryn bigelow doesn't disappoint. Been a fan since point break. Any other movies like it?
2,High Life (2018) was Bleak I thought it was just about his man and his baby in space but it was so much more. It was all kinds of messed up and disturbing. The cinematography was amazing and haunting. There was so much going on. It is the first english speaking movie for director claire denis and she did a stellar job. Robert pattinson and juliette binoche were excellent. There was a feeling of dread and emptiness. Any other movies like it?
2,"Disconnect (2012) was intense I watched men, women and children a while ago and people recommended disconnect. I finally watched it and it was pretty sad. Jason bateman and the cast were great. The story was interesting and relatable. Stay safe out there online. It is a dangerous place. Online addiction is a serious problem. Any other movies like it?"
2,"Holmes and Watson was god awful I wasn't expecting much but it was terrible. I knew i should have listened to all those critics and reviews. Not going to lie, i laughed at some of the jokes. They tried too hard to make it edgy and all the jokes seemed forced. Just another pay cheque for them. It was still enjoyable but it is a total mess. Rebecca hall is a delight though."
2,Stronger was Inspirational I am a big fan of jake gyllenhaal and he always has powerful performances. He really dives head first into the character and makes it his own. Tatiana maslany was great too. Hope she gets more roles. She killed it on orphan black. The story was sad and uplifting. There is so much evil in the world. Solid autobiographical movie. Any other movies like it?
2,Us was Thrilling It was not as amazing as get out but still a pretty good movie. Jordan peele is on a roll. I can't wait to watch the twilight zone show and the candyman. He is really making a name for himself. There were some shocking scenes and the characters were interesting. The story was pretty intriguing. Any other movies like it?
2,"The Watcher (2000) was not that bad Keanu reeves was not believable as a serial killer but in a messed up way, he could be. Sad to hear about the treatment of keanu during the movie. James spader and marisa tomei were good. Ernie hudson too. It is pretty complicated and he has basically disowned it. It was alright and it was enjoyable. The story was too basic and not enough suspense. Any other movies like it?"
2,Faults (2014) was amazing I've always been a fan of mary elizabeth winstead since sky high. I thought it was just a movie about saving someone from a cult but it was so much more. This could be her best role. It was a different kind of movie. Nothing much happens but the dialogue and actions are exceptional. It doesn't sound that interesting but i was blown away. Better than i expected. Any other movies like it?
2,"The Perfection hit all the right notes It was intriguing, mysterious and disturbing. There were a few twists and turns. It had you thinking about different scenarios throughout the movie but it didn't end like that. Allison williams is backing up her truly amazing performance in get out with this masterclass. Logan browning was good too. Any other movies like it?"
2,"Sound of My Voice was Intriguing I haven't seen a movie quite like it. Brit marling was charismatic, enchanting, mysterious and beautiful. I have to watch her other movies. Can't believe i haven't heard much about her. She makes you want to join her cult. Cults are really messed up and i feel bad for the people that are brainwashed. Any other movies like it?"
2,Suburbicon was a mess It was like two movies in one but it was enjoyable. It was a different time back then. You could see the influence of the coen brothers but clooney tried to do too much. Matt damon and julianne moore were great. I really enjoyed the tone and mood of the movie. The storyline was pretty interesting along with the characters. Any other movies like it?
2,Greta was a nice little surprise I am not familiar with isabelle huppert but heard she is a talented actress who is starting to make a name for herself in hollywood. She has been dominating french cinema for a while. Good to see maika monroe. I've been a fan since the guest. She has it all. Chloe grace moretz is always a nice addition. The story was a little clunky and some things didn't make sense but still engrossing. She played the sweet lonely widow really well. Any other movies like it?
2,"Happy Death 2U was pretty fun I enjoyed the first one. I was expecting the sequel to be better but it was still interesting. They explained a few things from the first one. It was a good mix of horror, action and sci-fi. Jessica rothe is beautiful and talented. Hope to see her in more movies. She really carried the movie on her shoulders. Can't wait for the third one. Any other movies like it?"
2,"Spinning Man really went no where I am a big fan of guy pearcre, pierce brosnan and minnie driver but the movie didn't live up to expectations. I thought it had an interesting story when i first read about it. It had nice cinematography and quality acting but it lacked polish. It was missing that spark and mystery. I still enjoyed it though. Hope they make better movies together. Any other movies like it?"
2,Replicas was a mess I had no idea what the movie was about when i watched it. Thought it was keanu in space or something. Alice eve is a hottie and keanu is one of my faves. I still enjoyed it and i would try to play god if i lost my family. The science and cloning seemed too easy and there was lack of emotion from keanu during vital parts. There were also heaps of plot holes. Any other movies like it?
2,Love (2015) was quite explicit It was a deep and intense movie about toxic relationships. I wasn't surprised that they actually had sex in the movie. I really enjoyed this movie. It was quite an emotional rollercoaster. Gasper noe is known for really bizarre and intense movies. This was a highly sexually charged movie. They had good chemistry. I was surprised that the main actress wasn't an actor but a model and artist. She was solid and stunning. Any other movies like it?
2,"Peel (2019) was surprisingly heartwarming I know emile hirsch has struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction but he is an amazing actor. He also assaulted daniele bernfeld an executive from paramount. Good to see he is turning his life around. I really liked this movie. It was heartfelt and sweet. It is about family, growing up and learning about the outside world. Any other movies like it?"
2,Cold Pursuit really plowed through I thought it would be another liam neeson special but it was different and unexpected. I found it unexpectedly hilarious and brutal. The dark humour mixed well with all the kills I wish emmy rossum and laura dern had a bigger role. Sad that this movie is liam's last action movie. There were a few twists and turns. Any other movies like it?
2,Love and Other Drugs had its' Highs and Lows It is such a sweet and interesting movie. It is about the emergence of viagra and the rise of pharmaceutical reps. They are still the scum of the earth though. Jake gyllenhaal and anne hathaway have good chemistry. They are also incredibly talented and stunning. I don't usually like romantic comedies but this movie really touched me and also the hot ladies. Any other movies like it?
2,Beautiful Boy was Intense Drug addiction is one of the hardest things to recover from. It destroys your life. Timothee chalamet is everywhere at the moment. He is the next big thing. He really immersed himself in the role as a drug addict. Steve carell is redefining himself. He is a whole different person with that beard. It is really tough on the families too. Any other movies like it?
2,"Don't Worry He Won't Get Far On Foot Was Heartwarming John callahan is quite the character and i knew nothing about him, when i watched the movie. Joaquin phoenix and jonah hill were amazing. Rooney mara is a beauty and so talented. It was funny, heartfelt and intriguing. People suffering with quadriplegia are capable of living a full and productive life. Your life can change in an instant so don't drink and drive. When all hope is lost, he found a reason to live and overcome alcoholism. Any other movies like it?"
2,"Beautiful Creatures (2000) was a fun movie It was quirky and it had dark humour. Rachel weisz and susan lynch had good chemistry. The movie covered a few issues ranging from domestic abuse, kidnapping, drug abuse and corruption. People in abusive relationships should get help if they can. Don't know if it was meant to be intentionally funny but i laughed a few times. Any other movies like it?"
2,Hold the Dark was pretty weird I am a big fan of jeremy saulnier so i was excited about this movie. It was different to his other movies and i enjoyed it. The cinematography was breath taking and it really set the mood. Riley keough is a stunner and is pretty talented. Alexander skarsgard was dark and mysterious. Jeffrey wright was great too. Any other movies like it?
2,The Paperboy was Brutal It was gritty and dark. The cinematography and cast were amazing. It had an intriguing plot. There was so much racism and sexism in those days. John cusack was repulsive and putrid. Nicole kidman was trashy and promiscuous. Matthew mcconaughey was solid as usual. A different take on his usual shtick. Zac efron is doing a good job of shedding his clean cut image. Any other movies like it?
2,"Boy Erased was intense Can't believe gay conversion camps still exist. It is cruel and evil. Why can't accept people for who they are? Powerful performances from russell crowe, nicole kidman, joel edgerton and lucas hedges. Another fine directing job from joel. There were some scenes that stay with you. It is a messed up world out there. Any other movies like it?"
2,"Under the Silver Lake was Mysterious and Cryptic I had no idea what to expect when i first watched it. Thought it was about some monster in a lake but it turned out to be one big adventure. It is a very unique and puzzling movie. One thing led to another and it got pretty confusing. I understood most of it but there were some things that didn't make sense. Subliminal messages, cryptic puzzles, conspiracy theories and random stuff all mixed in one weird ass movie. Any other movies like it?"
2,The Frozen Ground was a solid movie It is a pretty thrilling serial killer mystery movie. Vanessa hudgens showed her vulnerable side and killed it. Intense performances from nicolas cage and john cusack too. It is based on a true story about john hansen. He was a monster who murdered and raped close to 50 women. One of the worst in history. Any other movies like it?
2,"Demolition was a solid movie about coping with loss Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the best actors out there. He never disappoints. This movie was sad, heartwarming and gives us hope. Naomi watts is a nice addition too. Sometimes you just need to vent and destroy stuff to feel something. People deal with grief and loss differently. Any other movies like it?"
2,The Upside was a touching movie I know it is a remake of the intouchables but i though it was pretty good. Haven't seen the original yet. Kevin hart is usually trash but he showed a whole different side in this movie. Funny and caring. Bryan cranston is always a delight and he owned the role. Nicole kidman was a lovely addition too. It makes you look at your life differently. Life is precious and you should make the most out of your life. Any other movies like it?
2,"Sorry To Bother You was a Wack Ass Movie Amazing debut from boots riley. It was something different and i have never seen a movie like that before. It was visually stunning and was totally weird. It is relevant to today's society. There are lots of different themes about slavery, unions, friendship, capitalism and fame. Tessa thompson is everywhere right now. Any other movies like it?"
2,Cop Car was a fun ride It is always good to see kevin bacon in these small movies. He is an amazing actor and one of my faves. He hasn't let me down yet. This movie had a simple plot and was interesting. I was so scared for those kids. Playing with guns is never a good idea. I thought it was a little short. It would have been perfect with an extra 15 minutes. The ending was ambiguous. Any other movies like it?
2,"The House That Jack Built was deeply disturbing I was surprised it wasn't as gory and messed up, as i thought it would be. It was more philosophical and puts you in the mindset of a psychopath/serial killer. Matt dillon always freaked me out and he always gave off those serial killer vibes. He just looks seedy and menacing. Thought uma thurman would have a bigger role. Lars von trier is a terrible person but he makes weird ass movies. I still have to watch his others. Any other movies like it?"
2,"Triple Frontier was a mixed bag They tried to fit in a few different genres in one movie. It was enjoyable but it was a mess. What a stacked cast: ben affleck, oscar isaac, charlie hunnam, pedro pascal and garrett hedlund. It had all the ingredients to be a blockbuster but it fell short. I enjoyed the heist but there wasn't much planning. There was barely any character development. Any other movies like it?"
2,"The Front Runner was intriguing I didn't know anything about gary hart but i think he would have made a decent president. I usually don't like political biopics but hugh jackman made the movie worth watching. Vera farmiga too. Even though it got savaged by the critics, i enjoyed it. It was a different time back then. Any other movies like it?"
2,Dragged Across Concrete was a slow burn It was made on a pretty small budget. Craig zahler is 3 for 3. He has made another amazing movie. Not as gory or disturbing as his last movies but still engrossing. I really loved bone tomahawk and brawl in cell block 99. I thought it dragged on a little too long. I like his style. Wish there was more action. Mel gibson and vince vaughn stole the show with michael jai white and tory kittles. The cinematography really set the dark mood. Any other movies like it?
2,Welcome to Marwen was all over the place It was enjoyable and i didn't know what to expect. Not as bad as the reviews say. It was visually amazing and the special effects were pretty cool. It was a clash of genres and too much going on at once. Steve carell and all the other actresses did a fine job. There needed to be more character development for the women in his life. It felt disjointed and messy. Mark hogancamp is incredibly talented and i'm glad that a movie was made about his trauma. I knew nothing about him before watching the movie. Any other movies like it?
2,"Climax gave me convulsions Gasper noe does some weird ass movies. I have to watch his other movies. Irreversible was intense. The choreography was riveting and the cinematography was amazing. There was a feeling of dread, paranoia and anxiety. Sofia boutella is a star on the rise. There was not much of a plot but it was like an acid trip. Any other movies like it?"
2,Submergence flopped hard It felt like i was watching two different movies. I enjoyed it but it was messy and didn't really make sense. James mcavoy and alicia vikander work well together. It was trying to hard to be something it wasn't. Why didn't she try to find the love of her life? I haven't seen a movie like it. There were some interesting parts and i learnt some stuff about the ocean. Any other movies like it?
2,Serenity really reeled me in I have mixed feelings about it. The movie was something different and simple but also pretty crazy. Jason clarke is always intimidating. He just has that face. You can't go wrong with macca and hathaway but they missed the mark this time. Diane lane is just so sexy. Always nice to see djimon. It was just all over the place. Any other movies like it?
2,Vox Lux Sux I was pretty disappointed with it actually. I was expecting more from it. The first half an hour was pretty good then it went downhill from there. The story had no substance and it was a mess. There were a few plot holes. Natalie portman's overacting was unbearable. I knew she was in character but still pretty bad. I am a natalie portman fan but not her finest moment. Jude law was pretty predatory in it. Raffey cassidy was the shining light in the movie.
2,"The Favourite was not the favourite I am a big fan of yorgas but this movie missed the mark for me. Hope he returns to form with his future movies. Weird and unsettling is what he is good at. It wasn't even a good period movie. It was not interesting or unsettling at all, like his other movies. The cinematography and the costumes were exceptional though. It should win the best costume design oscar. I am surprised by all the oscar nominations. I know it will probably win some awards but it was underwhelming and disappointing for me."
2,"A Star is Born is epic Thought it was one of the rise to stardom movies with no substance but it was so much more. It was about the rise, love and addiction. Bradley cooper took it to another level. He learnt how to play a guitar and sing like a pro. Amazing directional debut too. Couldn't believe he got snubbed by the oscars. It was aesthetically pleasing and all the colours really set the mood. I can understand the criticisms by some people about it being a little long and some things didn't add up. Lady gaga was always going to be a star. She is just ridiculously talented. I think she will win best song. Any other movies like it? "
2,Crazy Rich Asians was amazing It is your standard romcom with an asian cast but the cinematography was breathtaking. Surprised it only cost $30 million because it was so lavish and extravagant. I definitely want to visit singapore. I think the tourism in singapore soared after this movie. I was salivating while watching the movie. There were so many cliches and cheesiness but the characters were so lovable. Good to see an asian movie kill it at the box office. I think henry golding would be a solid choice for the next james bond. Any other movies like it?
2,Upgrade was all kinds of awesome I didn't know much about it but it was so cool. Budget tom hardy killed it. Have been a fan of leigh whannell since saw. Him and james wan are taking over hollywood. It was an interesting movie about advancements in technology. There was some crazy biohacking going on. Mesmerising and intriguing. It had a bit of everything in it. Any other movies like it?
2,Powder Blue was bittersweet It was an emotional rollercoaster. It is one of those interconnecting stories movies. I first heard about this movie because jessica biel was in it. Thought it wouldn't be good but it turned out good. Her stripping moves were world class. It was pretty impressive. Good ensemble too.Eddie redmayne was surprisingly good. Ray liotta should do more emotional dramas. Patrick swayze's last role and he knocked it out of the park. Timothy linh bui needs to do more movies. We need more vietnamese directors. Any other movies like it?
2,"The Runaways was a cool biopic It is amazing that dakota fanning was only 15 in the movie. Killer cast: kristen stewart, dakota fanning, scout taylor compton, riley keough and michael shannon. The music industry is so seedy and abusive. I didn't know anything about the runaways before watching the movie. I knew a little bit about joan jett but not the others. It was a different time back then and it was shocking they got away with all that stuff. Sex drugs and rock and roll! Any other movies like it?"
2,Rubber was bizarre It is one of the oddest movies i have ever watched. I got no idea what was going on. It was visually amazing but quite pretentious. This is what high art looks like. There is not much of a story but it was fun. There were some funny bits and the script was pretty bad. It is a big waste of money. Don't know how this movie was made. Any other movies like it?
2,Widows was a different take on a heist movie Elizabeth debicki stole my heart. She is super stunning. The cast is amazing but the movie didn't live up to the hype. Not the best liam neeson movie. Viola davis was a powerhouse. Michelle rodriguez and carrie coon were great too. It dragged on a bit. I expected more from steve mcqueen. Any other movies like it?
2,"You Were Never Really Here was unsettling The lack of dialogue and overpowering sounds really set the mood, for the dark and gloomy movie. I am not sure if i liked it or not. I liked we need to talk about kevin by the same director but this movie didn't feel right. Joaquin phoenix was intimidating and electrifying as usual. It was too short and it was missing something. Any other movies like it?"
2,"Mad Max Trilogy was incredible I finally watched the mad max trilogy and was blown away. They were all amazing movies. George miller is a true visionary. Also the late byron kennedy. The stunts were dangerous and crazy. Amazing cinematography, costumes, story, characters and action sequences. I wish he had a larger body of work. He hasn't done much in his long career. I know people hate beyond the thunderdome but it was fun and something different. Tina turner was a bold choice. Mel gibson killed it as mad max. He had that sense of vulnerability and toughness. I was disappointed there was no love interest between max and the warrior woman. I wish gyro was in the third one. Any other movies like it?"
2,The girl in the spider's web was a mess It was not a good addition to the millennium movies. I didn't like her look and it didn't feel like lisbeth. Claire foy is talented but she wasn't the right fit for the role. Her origin story was different in this movie so it was a little confusing. Fede alvarez is one of my fave directors but not a fan of this movie. The action and cinematography was pretty good but the screenplay was schlocky. Any other movies like it?
2,"BlacKkKlansman is still relevant in today's society The racial tensions, police brutality and bigotry still exists today. We live in a scary world. It doesn't help that trump is in charge. He is fueling the hate. Good to see denzel washington's son in a lead role. He owned it. Some parts were disjointed and it was clunky but overall it was amazing. Another spike lee masterpiece. Hope it wins a few oscars. The script and cinematography was solid. Ron Stallworth is an interesting guy and it is based on his life. David duke is a monster and i'm surprised he is not rotting in a dark cell. Any other movies like it?"
2,Sleepaway Camp were fun cheesy slashers I just watched all three of them last night. They were pretty outdated but they were still enjoyable. The first one was darker than the others. It was hilariously bad. The acting was so cringe worthy and they didn't take themselves seriously. I can't wait for the reboot. It will be interesting to see what they do with it. I haven't seen the 2008 remake yet but i heard it sucks. Any other movies like it?
2,"Under the skin is weird I had no idea what the movie was about, when i watched it. Not much dialogue and it is very random. Mysterious and bizarre. I understood it but i didn't really enjoy it. I am a big scarlett johansson fan so i decided to check it out. There wasn't much going on. Don't know why it got such great reviews. I thought it was some alien movie."
2,"Assassination Nation was hectic It was so loud and really in your face. Overload of the senses. I saw some similarities with the purge and some other dark teen movies. It was bloody, crude and funny. I thought it would be something different but it turned out fine. Thought bella thorne would be a main character but they just used her as a marketing tool. Any other movies like it?"
2,Trance was hypnotic I thought it was a movie about robbing an art gallery through means of hypnosis but it was so different. Danny boyle makes interesting movies with great depth. Rosario dawson left me in a trance. She is sexy as hell and she played the role so well. James mcavoy and vincent cassel were nice additions too. I'm still skeptical about the powers of hypnosis though. It is a bunch of hogwash. Any other movies like it?
2,The Clovehitch Killer was chilling It is not gory or ultra violent but it showed how normal the serial killer is. The urge to kill is too strong for them. He is a family man and someone you know. They conceal their identities so well. You could be living next to a serial killer and you won't even know it. I was pleasantly surprised how tense it was. We will never understand why they do what they do. Any other movies like it?
2,Truth or Dare was fun I was expecting it to be crap. It wasn't scary or anything but it had some meaning. The snap chat filter faces was pretty funny. I had a good laugh. Lucy hale is cute and she plays the innocent girl well. Violett beane was a pretty terrible person in the movie. Pretty good for a teen horror. Any other movies like it?
2,Cam is bizarre I didn't know what to expect when i watched it but it turned out great. Madeline brewer was amazing in the handmaid's tale so i decided to give cam a shot. It was well shot and really pulled you into. The cam girl world is really weird and scary. They expose themselves to the world. It would be terrifying to meet your admirers in person. It is based on isa mazzei's experiences as a cam girl. Any other movies like it?
2,Unsane is mental Steven soderbergh strikes again. It was filmed using an iphone so it was a bit annoying sometimes. It was pretty disturbing and unsettling. I thought it would be a run of the mill mental institution movie but it was insane. Those places are terrifying and i feel sorry for people who get admitted there. I guess it is a complicated problem. Any other movies like it?
2,Searching was something different Good to see more asian representation in hollywood movies. John cho really took the lead. It was filmed through online searches and devices. It was interesting and kept me entertained. Debra messing was a lovely addition too. Every parent's worst nightmare. Do you really know what your children get up to online? Pretty accurate depiction of the modern world and the changing online landscape. Any other movies like it?
2,Bad Times at the El Royale was pretty neat I didn't know what to expect when i watched it. The characters were intriguing and mysterious. It really made you think. Quite a stacked cast. Chris hemsworth was mesmerising and dakota johnson was dreamy. Cabin in the woods was a cluster fuck. Drew goddard has style. Jeff bridges is such an amazing actor. Any other movies like it?
2,A Simple Favor was delightful! Anna kendrick and blake lively were magnificent. Anna played the innocent mother really well and she added her quirkiness to the role. Blake was mysterious and obnoxious. Henry golding is a lovely addition. It was not what i was expecting. A few twists and turns. Time to start a blog. Paul feig knows how to make funny movies. Any other movies like it?
2,Aquaman was epic I knew nothing about aquaman when i watched it at the aussie premiere. I was pleasantly surprised. I was enthralled for the whole movie. James wan did a fantastic job with his first superhero movie. He is going from strength to strength. The dialogue was pretty cheesy in some parts but still lots of fun. The special effects and the cinematography was unreal. Amber heard was a delight and she was so damn attractive. Jason momoa was born to play aquaman. He looks like a god. I thought nicole kidman looked a little young to play the mother. We have been bombarded with superhero movies and it is getting out of control. It is a fine addition to the dc universe. Any other movies like it?
2,"Mandy is a weird ass movie It was totally different from what i imagined. Everyone involved in that movie, must have been on acid or something. It was stylish, bizarre and gory. Psycho cage is the best cage! It felt like i was in another world and they took me on a wacky adventure. Haven't seen a movie like it and i've seen some weird movies. Cage seems to be in so many movies. He never turns down any roles. Any other movies like it?"
2,Ladybird was sweet and heartfelt It is one of the best coming of age movies i've ever seen. Sensational directional debut from greta gerwig. Saoirse ronan is a talented young actress who is making a name for herself. She has already been nominated for an oscar and she will win one eventually. The movie made me quite emotional. I despised timothee chalamet's character. Such a douche. Any other movies like it?
2,Peppermint was crazy fun! I know the revenge genre has been played out but peppermint was very nice. Jennifer garner kicked ass. I wish it showed more of the killings though. I really like revenge movies. Normal people pushed to the extreme. Losing someone you love that way is awful. I see the similarities between this movie and death wish. I hope jennifer garner does more of these action/thriller movies. Any other movies like it? 
2,Mom and Dad was hectic I thought it was a zombie movie but it turned out different. Nicolas cage always brings his weirdness to his roles. Fun to watch. Selma blair played her role well. We got to see another side of her. Anne winters is a babe. I think parents can relate to it. Sometimes kids are out of control and crazy. Any other movies like it?
2,The Year of Living Dangerously is another Peter Weir Masterpiece Sigourney weaver is a knock out and mel gibson is a dreamboat. I wish they did more movies together. They had good chemistry. Peter weir knows how to create masterpieces. The soundtrack really set the mood. Surprised it wasn't nominated for best picture and director. Linda hunt deserved her win. Her character was amazing. These countries struggle to survive and it is heartbreaking. They die from starvation and preventable diseases. Any other movies like it?
2,Romper Stomper was raw! I've heard about it for a long time but i just saw it the other day. It was quite scary and still relevant today. Crazy world we live in. People don't have sympathy for the struggles of refugees and immigrants. They just want a better life for themselves. Russell crowe was menacing as hando. Jacqueline mckenzie was amazing. Sad that daniel pollock who played davey jumped under a train after the film was finished. Drug addiction destroys lives. American history x was much better but romper stomper is still a classic. Any other movies like it?
2,And soon the darkness was a let down. I didn't think it would be that bad. The acting was terrible and the script was bland. I still enjoyed it a little bit. It lacked suspense and the plot was pretty flimsy. Nice scenery though. Argentina is a beautiful place. Amber heard and odette annable are not good actresses. They are really attractive though. Any other movies like it?
2,"The Belko Experiment was bloody fun! It was not a perfect movie. It was flawed but it was enjoyable. Didn't know what to expect, when i watched it. Greg mclean is a talented aussie director. Survival of the fittest. You can't go wrong with a james gunn script. It could have been a little longer. I usually don't like movies shorter than 90 minutes but this movie didn't overkill it. Any other movies like it?"
2,Den of Thieves was a solid heist movie It is not as good as the masterpiece heat but it was fun and enjoyable. I was skeptical about the movie because 50 cent and gerard butler were in it but it turned out well. Gerard butler is a cool dude and he always does fun movies. 50 cent is building his empire. Oshea jackson jr has a bright future. Can't believe the stripper was 50 years old. She didn't look that old. I can't wait for the sequel. Any other movies like it?
2,The killing of sacred deer was bizarre Yorgos lanthimos is a real weirdo and i love it. He makes the most unusual and unsettling movies. This movie wasn't as bizarre as his previous movies but it still made me uncomfortable. Martin was a freak and there was something really wrong with him. It was a slow burn and the way they spoke was classic yorgos. Any other movies like it?
2,"The Master was a strange movie. I know it is not based on ron hubbard and the origins of scientology but i saw some similarities. Phillip seymour hoffman is one of the greats and will be sorely missed. His screen presence is overpowering. Joaquin phoenix is another powerhouse. He is quirky, weird and amazing to watch. Paul thomas anderson knows how to make masterpieces. Unreal cinematography and immaculate script. Any other movies like it?"
2,"Men, Women and Children is a real eye opener! Online addiction is a serious problem and it can negatively affect your way of life. It is cluttered at times but it delivers a strong message. It is an interesting movie about all kinds of relationships and addictions. The cast is amazing and they bring something special to the table. Good to see adam sandler in a serious role. Jennifer garner is killing it. Judy greer is always a nice surprise. Any other movies like it?"
2,"Picnic at Hanging Rock was hauntingly beautiful I've been wanting to watch it for a long time but never had a chance. I just watched it and it blew me away. It was eerie, beautiful and the atmosphere was incredible. The actresses were ethereal and angelic. Amazing cinematography and soundtrack. Peter weir knows how to create masterpieces. I like these kind of unsolved mystery movies. It still gives me chills. I have to watch the tv series now. Any other movies like it?"
2,Good Time was a wild ride Robert pattinson is doing some amazing stuff. He has come a long way from the goblet of fire and twilight. He is becoming a great actor. The intensity he brought to connie was something to behold. It was a different kind of crime drama. You didn't know what was going to happen next. Crazy ass soundtrack too. Nice work by the safdie brothers. Any other movies like it? 
2,"The Dirty Harry movies made my day I just finished the dead pool. The last entry in the dirty harry series. They all are different but similar. It is not your typical serial killer movies. Harry callahan is funny and tough. There are some great one liners and they are action packed. The score is excellent and so is the cinematography, and dialogue. Clint eastwood is a living legend and will go down in history as the best. His body of work is extraordinary. I still have to watch a lot of his movies. I only scraped the tip of the iceberg. I don't know which one i liked the best. Probably magnum force but it is hard to choose one. Any other movies like it?"
2,Hereditary is unsettling and unnerving! I didn't know what to expect when i watched it. Just heard it was a scary horror movie. An amazing directional debut from ari aster. It drags on for a while and it haunts you. Wonderful performance from toni collette. Her reactions were insane. That little girl freaked me out. There was something really wrong with her. It is different from other horror movies. It is a good movie about mental illnesses and coping with grief. Any other movies like it?
2,"The killing gene was messed uap! I didn't know what to expect when i watched it a few days ago. It was intense and disturbing. Melissa george did a killer job along with stellan skarsgard and selma blair. Tom hard was evil as hell in it. It has a few twists and turns. It didn't hold back on the violence and torture. There is so much evil in the world, it is scary. Any other movies like it?"
2,The Thoroughbreds was unsettling. I didn't know what to expect when i watched it last night. Just heard it was dark and funny. Anya taylor-joy is out of this world. She has a very unique look and makes her characters so much more interesting. There was good chemistry between her and olivia cooke. It really makes you think about life. I liked the back and forth between the leads. Anton yelchin was amazing in his role. Gong to miss him. Any other movies like it?
2,Arrival is mind blowing. I thought it would be just another basic alien encounter sci fi but it was so magical. Language is a powerful tool. Amy adams is beautiful and such a joy to watch. She really chooses good movies. Always good to see jeremy renner too. It was an emotional rollercoaster. Denis villeneuve does some really weird and interesting movies. Any other movies like it?
2,Irreversible was nauseating I heard a lot about it but it was still hard to watch. It put me in a head spin. The shaky and shoddy camera work got a little annoying and made me dizzy. It got better throughout the movie. Monica bellucci is stunning and a mighty fine actress. Vincent cassel always adds that intensity to his roles. Gasper noe is known for his disturbing movies. It reminded me of memento. Any other movies like it?
2,"The girl on the train was chilling I knew it was a mystery thriller but it wasn't what i was expecting. Emily blunt stole the show as an alcoholic and messed up woman. I don't know why people keep comparing it to gone girl, because it is not even close to gone girl. It got panned by the critics but i thought is was pretty good. The cast was excellent. Haley bennett is a beauty and she has depth. Justin theroux, allison janney and rebecca ferguson were nice additions too. It kept me guessing until the end. Any other movies like it?"
2,"Split was intense I didn't know what the movie was about, when i first watched it. It blew me away. James mcavoy really stepped it up. He was creepy and menacing. It was unsettling. Anya taylor-joy is uniquely beautiful and talented. She showed vulnerability and strength in her role. Haley lu richardson and jessica sula were good too. M night shyamalan is back to his best. I should really watch unbreakable now. Any other movies like it?"
2,Joint Security Area was an amazing movie! I didn't know what to expect when i watched it. Just heard it was good. It covered themes of forbidden friendships. We are all humans in the end. It was a pretty sad movie and a realistic view of the brutal world we live in. It was a different kind of mystery thriller. I wasn't expecting such a powerful movie. Any other movies like it?
2,Bitch Slap was Titillating and Crude! It was so terrible and cheesy but it was heaps of sexy fun. It was full on puns and innuendo and horrendous acting. There was no nudity unfortunately but there was a lot of flesh. It paid homage to those exploitation movies from decades ago. I was laughing so hard throughout the movie. It looked amateurish. Any other movies like it?
2,The Chaser is a different take on the serial killer genre I didn't know much about it when i watched it. It is not the best korean thriller but it is pretty good. There were a few plot holes and some things didn't make sense. I have so many questions about it but i can't find any answers on the internet. Not as bloody as i was expecting but it did keep me interested. Hope you guys can help me. Any other movies like it?
2,"The butterfly effect trilogy was mind-blowing! The butterfly effect is one of the best scifi/psychological horror movie, i've ever watched. Ashton kutcher played the role very well. He tried to change the past and had to live with the consequences. Amy smart was good too. Quite an emotional movie. The sequel was disappointing and quite pointless.  It was an awful mess. The third one was decent and pretty interesting. It should have been longer. Any other movies like it?"
2,Baby Driver was truly a feast for the eyes and ears. I thought it would just be a regular heist movie with some music but it turned out great. The cast was amazing and the storyline was unpredictable. It had heart and it was an emotional rollercoaster. Ansel elgort turned up the heat. He played the role so well. He showed off his range. Lily james is cute and so talented. I felt their chemistry. Jamie foxx was intense as usual. Jon hamm and eiza gonzalez added some spice and humour. Edgar wright is a man on top of his powers. The use of sounds and music was incredible. Blended well with the movie and added depth to the story. Any other movies like it?
2,"Soldier's Girl was a depressing movie. I watched it ages ago when it was on tv but it has always stuck with me. It is even more sad, considering it is a true story. It is about love, jealousy and sexual identity. If you are in the army, there are a certain set of rules to oblige by. Lee pace was amazing in it. It is the first movie i have ever seen about the trans community, and it was really intense. Any other movies like it?"
2,Annihilation was a weird ass movie. There were some parts i didn't really understand but i've read up on it. Didn't study physics in high school but i got the gist of it. It was visually spectacular and interesting. Not the best acting in the world but it was solid enough. Ex-machina is one of my fave movies so i wanted to check out annihilation and i wasn't disappointed. It really messed with my mind. Any other movies like it?
2,Alyce Kills was a crazy downward spiral I had no idea what the movie was about when i watched it. I thought it was a revenge thriller but it was so different. It was just on my computer so i wasn't disappointed. The movie was a bloody mess. It really makes you think. It has some crazy gory and random moments. Sometimes you have to take matters into your own hands. Any other movies like it?
2,Jennifer 8 misses the mark I didn't know what to expect but it was alright. I didn't see it coming but it was missing that killer blow. Andy garcia is an underrated and great actor. Uma thurman was great too. The movie was lacking suspense and action. It had some good moments but it was flat. I was a bit disappointed. Thought it would be more interesting and more of a story. This movie destroyed the director's career. Any other movies like it?
2,"Trash Fire was something different It wasn't as good as excision but it had it's moments. Pretty dark movie. Annalynne mccord was terrifying in it. She is a beautiful and talented actress, that plays some ugly roles. Adrian grenier was terrific and it really looked like he was having seizures. Angela trimbur was great too. Richard bates jr makes some weird dark messed up movies. Any other movies like it?"
2,"Tragedy Girls is really messed up and funny! I thought it would be a run of the mill slasher flick but it turned out great. It has a good blend of violence and dark humour. It is something different. One for the millennials and their obsession with social media and being famous. It reminds me of mean girls, heathers and scream. Killer cast too. Any other movies like it?"
2,Happy Death Day was a nice little surprise! I thought it would be lame but it turned out great. It was funny and had a bit of mystery. I like those guess the killer movies. A homage to groundhog day and scream. I thought it was different to other cliched horror movies. It had meaning and depth. The main actress is a delight. She played the role very well. All the others added to the story line.  Any other movies like it?
2,Running Scared was crazy fun! I always wanted to watch it then paul walker passed away. I forgot about it for a while until i watched it the other night. It is his best role. He had so much raw emotion and it was action packed. There was no boring moments. It was an adrenaline rush. There were some messed up scenes. Vera farmiga is a delight and a total stunner. Not your average action thriller. Any other movies like it?
2,"Still Alice was quite sad! I wasn't too sure about the content of the movie, before watching it but i was pleasantly surprised. It was sad and depressing. One minute you are on top of the world, the next your memory is gone. Strong performance from julianne moore who is one of my fave actresses. Her performance was so raw and intense. Alec baldwin has that intimidating screen presence and he is never boring. Kristen stewart was a nice little surprise too. It really makes you value life and gives you some perspective. Any other movies like it?"
2,Ken Park was pretty messed up! I know why it is banned in australia but times have changed. The characters are all flawed and deeply troubled. It was hard to watch some scenes. Makes me sad. It was raw and brutal how your life can get so messed up. I still think larry clark and harmony korine are pretty creepy. It is based off his teenage life. He has seen some disturbing stuff. Any other movies like it?
2,"Berlin Syndrome was unsettling and a decent psychological thriller! I didn't know what to expect when i first watched it. It is a layered movie about stockholm syndrome, relationships, abuse and other stuff. The ending was pretty sloppy and there were some unanswered questions. Teresa palmer is always a delight and she bared her soul in this movie. She was raw and stripped back. Max was scary and quite intimidating but still very charismatic. Hope others can help me with it? Any other movies like it?"
2,"It was Freaky! I haven't read the stephen king novel even though i'm a big fan, so i didn't know what to expect. Bullying is the worst and more should be done to prevent it. I think it is quite sad to see kids go through hell and fear for their life. The movie wasn't scary at all but it was still a good movie. Bill skarsgard did an amazing job as pennywise. The kids were great too. I wonder who they will cast as the adult version of the teens. Can't wait for the sequel. Any other movies like it?"
2,The Town was a heist movie with heart! I've seen lots of heist movies but the town is up there. Ben affleck is an amazing director and actor. Stellar cast and i thought it would end differently. Rebecca hall is always a delight and she is beautiful. Blake lively played the trashy crackhead really well. Jeremy renner killed it and he never disappoints. Jon hamm should be in more movies. Any other movies like it?
2,"Black Mass was a Cool Gangster Movie! It had a star studded cast: johnny depp, benedict cumberbatch, kevin bacon, david harbour, joel edgerton, adam scott and so on. Johnny depp was scary as hell, as james 'whitey' bulger. I don't know much about him but he is a thug. Johnny depp was unrecognisable as he transformed into that monster. Joel edgerton is going places. Any other movies like it. "
2,"Manchester By the Sea was an emotional movie about grief, loss and depression! I know casey affleck is considered by many to be a monster for the sexual assualt and harassment allegations against him, but he is an amazing actor. The movie was very depressing and makes you ponder about your life. Your life can change for the worst in an instant. You should appreciate your life and live life to the fullest, because you don't know when you will lose it all. Oscar worthy performance from casey and it hits you right in the heart. Michelle williams was good in her limited screen time. Lucas hedges is a talented young up and comer. Any other movies like it?"
2,"The Accountant Shines a Light on Autism! It was surprisingly good and enjoyable. Ben Affleck played the role well. It was different to his other performances. He made accounting seem interesting. I guess i have to watch good will hunting now. Anna kendrick is cute and she was good in the movie. She is always smart and witty. J.k simmons is always a nice surprise. He can change it up. Cynthia addai-robinson, john lithgow and jon bernthal were good too. Alison wright was an intriguing character and she added value to the story. There were some cool action scenes and forensic accounting. Any other movies like it?"
2,Molly's Game was a Royal Flush! I didn't know much about the movie. I only heard about the incident with tobey maguire and making her bark like a seal for a tip. The movie draws you in with the amazing cinematography and the intriguing characters. Molly bloom really knew how to network and build her poker game. Jessica chastain was simply irresistible and easiest her sexiest role to date. I hope she wins an oscar but she has stiff competition. Excellent performance. Idris elba always gives stellar performances. He has that air of coolness and suaveness about him. Kevin costner is a lovely addition too. You can tell it is a sorkin movie with the extensive and witty dialogue. It translates well on film and it is an amazing directional debut. He is one of the best in the business. Any other movies like it?
3,"The Crow Remake Director Idea Unlike a lot of other people, I actually want the proposed remake of 1994's The Crow to be remade. I love the original film and the style Alex Proyas brought to it, but I also think a remake can work. James O'Barr (Who wrote the Crow comic) said that the film would be even darker and more faithful to the graphic novel. I'm all for that despite the constant delays and actor changes this film has been facing.

I actually have a director choice for this film. Justin Kurzel. He's become one of my favorite filmmakers working today thanks to his work on Macbeth and Assassin's Creed (And his Kelly Gang film sounds really good as well) and I think his dark/bleak style would fit in really well with The Crow story. I had thought before about what potential comic book adaptation Kurzel would be a good fit for. Instead of Marvel or DC based films, I think he should do a one shot film like a Crow or a Nemesis (Based on Mark Millar's great comic).

3,"Movie Quality Predictions Gone Wrong? As movie fans, we always have out big predictions on what movies we think will turn out great or horrible. Here are my 2 big examples (Both 20th Century Fox films ironically).

On the movie I thought would suck but ended up being great side is Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes (2011). I remember finding the trailers and commercials to this movie laughably bad and there was that consensus among many people that trying to relaunch the Apes franchise again was a dumb idea. But the movie ended up being a well told story with a great lead character in Andy Serkis's Ceaser. It wasn't just big dumb action, it was a very strong sci fi drama and reminded people that summer blockbusters can also have great stories and compelling characters. And it of course led into 2 excellent sequels and one of the best trilogies.

On the movie I thought would be great but ended up being poor side is Fantastic Four (2015). Many people were hating on this film years before it came out and I was actually a defender of it because of all the talent involved in front of and behind the camera. I also thought the first couple of trailers were excellent and teased an interesting new take on Marvel's first family. Sadly the movie turned out to be a huge failure with critics, fans, and the box office and had enormous behind the scenes drama and production issues. I'll admit that I don't hate the film like most people do and actually think it starts off alright, but it completely falls apart at the end. I would love to see Trank's original cut someday.

3,"Was The Last Airbender Really M Night Shyamalan's Fault The 2010 adaptation of Nickelodeon's Avatar The Last Airbender is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I remember being excited to see it because of the trailers and ads, but it ended up being a an awful mess with a rushed plot, terrible pacing, horrible dialogue and acting, mostly unfinished looking CGI, poor character development, and just plain soulless. Many people (Myself included) believe it's M Night's worst made film, but is it really all his fault?

Well if stories are to be believed, the answer actually might be no. Not a lot of people seem to know this, but a few years ago it got reported that the production of the Airbender film was a very troubled one. Apparently, M Night was really passionate to make this film as he and his family are huge fans of the cartoon, but several producers forced changes to the script and casting choices that he didn't want. That also lead into the some of the casting and race controversies the movie received before and during it's release. Also, they were forced to change filming locations, ILM had trouble rendering the VFX, the budget was changed, and they cut out about half an hour of footage because they wouldn't be able to post convert all of the scenes they filmed into crappy 3D. All of this proved to be a miserable experience for M Night and other members of the crew and they lost enthusiasm for the film because of it.

https://web.archive.org/web/20171212232703/http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/insight-into-the-failure-of-the-last-airbender-why-m-night-isnt-to-blame-576

I believe these stories. The movie is so bad that I can't see it just being one person's fault and it would explain several of the film's issues. Now I'm not saying this makes M Night blameless, but it also shows that he may not have been the main source of the problems.

3,"Best Movies Of 2014? It's always interesting IMO when fellow film fans discuss what we consider some of the best years for movies. Some of the big ones that come up include 

1982 (Blade Runner, The Thing, E.T., Conan The Barbarian, Rambo First Blood, etc)

1994 (The Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, The Lion King, The Crow, True Lies, etc)

1999 (American Beauty, Toy Story 2, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, Fight Club, etc)

But another big one that comes to my mind is 2014. I know it's more recent compared to the previous years, but there were a lot of great films to come out of 2014. Here's a list of my personal favorites.

1. Whiplash (Damien Chazelle)- This is one of the most thrilling films I've ever seen. Chazelle directs this film perfectly IMO. He gets incredible performances out of Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons as Andrew and Mr Fletcher for a psychological thriller about obsession and impressing your tutor. The film also contains some of the best editing I've seen in recent years and one of the best finales to a film I've ever seen. You're so on the edge of your seat like it's some big car chase and you want to cheer as the screen goes to black. Best film of the year in my humble opinion and destined to mentioned alongside all time classics.

2. X-Men Days Of Future Past (Bryan Singer)- I know some film buffs mock the idea of putting a big superhero movie in a best of the year list, but I don't care. Not only is Days Of Future past the best film in the X-Men franchise IMO and the best comic book movie of that year, it's also become my personal favorite superhero film. It's so well balanced. Say what you will about Bran Singer as a person, but he and writer Simon Kinberg knew how to put in the right amounts of heavy drama, humor (Especially with Quicksilver), and action setpieces (That opening fight with the Sentinels was awesome and intense). The film also contains an amazing score from X-Men franchise composer John Ottman and terrific performances from everyone involved like Hugh Jackman, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Peter Dinklage, Patrick Stewart, etc. The stand out though IMO was James Mcavoy as Xavier. He was already great as the character in First Class, but he plays this broken misguided Xavier so well and I think he could've gotten an Oscar nom for this role.

3. Nightcrawler (Dan Gilroy)- This film deserved to make more money than it did and deserved more love at The Oscars. First time director Dan Gilroy gave us a compelling film that captures that feeling of nightlife in L.A. and one of the best performances I've ever seen with Jake Gyllenhaal as Lou Bloom. He gives a performance so committed, charismatic, and creepy that it's an absolute crime he wasn't at least nominated for an Oscar. It also introduced me to Riz Ahmed's talents and has one of the best and darkest endings to a film this decade.

4. Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes (Matt Reeves)- 2011's Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes really surprised me. I thought it was a stupid idea and thought the trailers looked dumb, but it ended up being one of my favorite films of that year (And Andy Serkis deserved nominations for all 3 of these films for his work as Ceaser). Some were a bit skeptical about the sequel though since Rupert Wyatt was replaced with Matt Reeves, but those fears were quickly put to rest. This ended up being the Empire Strikes Back/Godfather Part 2/Dark Knight/Toy Story 2/Spider-Man 2 of the Planet Of The Apes franchise. A great looking post apocalyptic world, excellent drama between the humans and apes, great performances from everybody involved, a really strong score, some of the best visual effects I've ever seen, and one of the best and most compelling villains in recent years with Toby Kebbell's Koba. Combine all of that and you get an amazing sequel and more proof that big popcorn summer blockbusters can also be excellent films.

5. The Babadook (Jennifer Kent)- Horror films can sometimes struggle thanks to an overreliance on jump scares, flat performances, and showing too much of a creature. That's not the case with The Babadook. Instead we get a dark and psychological  film about a troubled relationship between mother and son without a lot of the actual creature on screen. And my god Essie Davis's performance in this film is just phenomenal. I'm surprised she isn't a bigger name in Hollywood.

6. A Brony Tale (Brent Hodge)- I saw this documentary on Netflix before ever seeing a full episode of My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic (I've become a big fan since). It follows Ashleigh Ball (Voice of Rainbow Dash and Applejack in the series) and her discovery of the brony fandom and shows interviews with several fans. In an age where there's a lot of toxicity in fandom, I think this is a film more people should check it out as it shows how a property can be so important to many different across the world. In this film's case it's My Little Pony, but it's also true with many other franchises like Star Wars, Harry Potter, Star Trek, etc. I hope one day this toxicity dies off and it's all just good and loving fans.

7. Birdman (Alejandro González Iñárritu)- The film that won the 2015 Best Picture Oscar. While I would've personally given it to Whiplash and thought Inarritu's follow up film The Revenant was better, I have no complaints with Birdman winning. It's a brilliantly told story with excellent performances (Michael Keaton's comeback) and editing that makes it look like it's all done in one take. The film is also a really good commentary on movies, actors, blockbusters, critics, etc. I'll admit that I wasn't a big fan of the very last scene in the film, but it's great overall.

8. 22 Jump Street (Phil Lord and Chris Miller)- It's tough to make a comedy sequel good, but 22 Jump Street ended up being one of the exceptions to the rule. Yes the film has the exact same plot as the first film (Cops going undercover as students in a school to try and stop drug dealers), but they're totally aware of it and have fun with it. There are so many jokes in this film that really got me laughing, particularly the moment when Schmidt and Jenko hallucinate after taking some of the drug. I would have loved to have gotten a third film with more of Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill's bromance chemistry and Ice Cube as their boss, but I'll cherish the 2 films we got.

9. Edge Of Tomorrow (Doug Liman)- I initially thought the trailers to this film looked terrible and boring, but it turned out to be one of my favorite Tom Cruise films. Based on a Japanese novel, we get to see a sci fi Groundhog Day like story where Tom Cruise (Doing more crazy stunts) plays a coward and is trained by a badass Emily Blunt. I hope the planned sequel to this film actually happens.

10. The LEGO Movie (Phil Lord and Chris Miller)- Everything is awesome after all. I know many thought this movie sounded like a stupid idea at first, but the great duo of Lord/Miller proved us wrong by making a clever and funny film with likable characters and gorgeous stop motion like animation that all ages can enjoy. It's a shame that the franchise may be dead now, but that first film will always be special.

Honorable mentions go to Lenny Abrahamson's Frank, Craig Johnson's The Skeleton Twins, and David Fincher's Gone Girl.

That's my Top 10 list, but what's yours? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"My Little Pony The Movie (2017) In Depth Review/Analysis If you had told me almost a decade ago now that I would become a fan of the new My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic show (AKA a brony), I would've thought you were crazy. I had no issues with the fandom (There's actually a great 2014 documentary about the fandom called A Brony Tale), but thought that it didn't look like something for me. That changed last year after my little sister started watching the show on Netflix and after a few months of watching some episodes with her, I started to see why this show has such a following and it became my second favorite cartoon (Right behind Spectacular Spider-Man). It's a really sweet show with likable lead female characters and a really interesting fantasy world in Equestria and is really about reminding how we can be good friends with others and be good people in general.

Anyways, this review is for 2017's My Little Pony The Movie. I also saw this movie with my little sister before becoming a true fan of the series myself and thought that it was just okay and felt more like an extended episode of the series (Like the Spongebob films and The Simpsons Movie). But I kind of had a desire to rewatch it now that I am a fan of the series and because it would be a good fit for this series of reviews I'm doing. So I did and I can say that I do appreciate it a bit more despite some issues I still have with the script.

The biggest strength of the film IMHO is that it still retains the heart and energy from the Friendship Is Magic series. The lovable personalities of the Mane Six are still there along with the colorful animation (I know it's updated a bit for this film, but it still fits the tone and style of this world), music, and character designs.

Speaking of the animation, it was pretty nice to see to see a major wide release 2D animated film again. Don't get me wrong, I love good 3D animated movies from studios like Pixar and Dreamworks, but I do kind of miss seeing 2D animated films. My Little Pony The Movie is one of only 3 theatrically released 2D animated films this decade along with 2011's Winnie The Pooh and last year's Teen Titans Go To The Movies. It would be nice if we got more of those soon. The film also contains really colorful and nice looking designs for all the new places our heroes visit and helps expand the lore of this G4 incarnation of the franchise.

The movie also retains the great voice acting from the show. Tara Strong (Twilight Sparkle), Andrea Libman (Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy), Ashleigh Ball (Rainbow Dash and Applejack), and Tabitha St Germain (Rarity) have brought so much life and energy into these characters for almost a decade now and once again they bring their A game to this film. The best scene of the film IMO is that argument scene between Twilight and Pinkie where Twilight lashes out at her and the others after she tried (And failed to steal) the hippogriff's pearl. Incredible voice over work from Strong and Libman. I sometimes feel like true voice actors like them and many others get overlooked because of how many times animated films (Including this one) cast big celebrities to voice the characters. Sure that can work out really well like with Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allan as Buzz in the Toy story films, but there are also times where it probably would've been better had they cast professional voice actors.

One of the big issues I have with the film though is that certain characters are really underused. Twilight is the central character and you get to see some of the other members of the Mane Six form a bond with the new characters in the film. Pinkie forms one with Princess Skystar, Rainbow Dash forms one with Captain Celaeno, and Rarity with Capper. But for some reason, they didn't do that with Applejack or my personal favorite character in the series Fluttershy (Although she does this one great brief moment where she reforms one of the evil guards) It's one of the reasons why I feel like this film should've been a bit longer (Plus it could've given the film a bit more breathing time) Also, the main villain of the film is The Storm King and yet he's barely in it and is killed near the end.

Speaking of villains, Tempest Shadow was quite good in the film (And has a really cool character design). Yeah they give her tragic backstory like some of the other villains in the series, but it worked for me and it allowed her to have the best song in the film with Open Up Your Eyes. With her reformation at the end, I also feel like that worked. Yes I do feel like MLP FIM reforms their bad guys too much, but there have been intances where it works like with Discord, Starlight Glimmer, and IMO, Tempest.

About the musical numbers/songs, great as always (Aside from maybe the cover of We've got the beat at the very beginning). I just mentioned that I feel like Open Up Your Eyes is the best song in the film, but I close second would maybe be We've Got This Together.

So yeah, I like this film overall. Was it one of 2017's best? No, but it's a pretty sweet film with the same likable characters from the series, great ,music and animation, terrific voice acting, some funny jokes, etc. And at least we didn't get Sony's version of this film where the Mane Six would've come to the real world and turn into CGI characters Smurfs style. I've defended Sony sometimes and think they have put out good films recently, but this sounded like a trainwreck to me.

To go along with ""What Could've Been"", I want to talk about some deleted scenes. There's only one deleted scene on the Blu Ray which is an alternate opening narrating by Twilight where she explains who the princesses and her friends are. I actually feel like this should've been kept in the film for newcomers. And according to an art book for the film, there were supposed to be a couple of more scenes of the Mane Six travailing to new locations.

I now give MLP The Movie a 3.5/5.

What do you think of the film? Love it? Hate it? In between? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Excitement For The Next Mortal Kombat Movie? They're finally going start filming the long in development hell Mortal Kombat reboot this September in Australia for a planned release in March 2021. On one hand, I'm really excited because I've been wanting another Mortal Kombat with a bigger budget for years, James Wan is producing it, and because I've been playing the newest game (MK11) with my brother recently and it's really fun (Scorpion is my favorite character and Sub Zero is his). But on the other hand, the director they've hired has never helmed any movies, TV episodes, or short films (Just commercials) and the writer has never written anything that's been released. Not saying these guys aren't talented, but there's no track record with them and I don't know if something like Mortal Kombat should be a director's first movie.

How do you feel? Excited? Nervous? (I'm kind of both) Comment and let me know and thanks for reading."
3,"Man Of Steel In Depth Review/Analysis So I'm back with another one of these in depth reviews of films. Today's one is for Zack Snyder's 2013 superhero/sci fi film Man Of Steel. I'll admit I was never the biggest Superman fan. I never disliked him (Except in Superman 3 and 4), but he was never one of my favorite heroes. But when I saw MOS, I grew a real appreciation for the character. I love this movie and think it should be mentioned along side The Dark Knight, Deadpool, X-Men Days Of Future Past, Spider-Man 2, and Logan as the greats of the comic book movie genre.

The film starts off great with the Krypton scenes (All of which look gorgeous thanks to amazing SFX and set designs and Amir Mokri's cinematography). We see that the planet is about to be destroyed due to mining of it's core and that Joer-El (Played brilliantly by Maximus himself Russel Crowe) and wife just had a son (Kal-El) who is the first natural birth in years. Everyone on Krypton is essentially engineered at birth to become a solider or doctor or a scientist, but Kal-El is the first true natural birth in a long time and is free to chose his destiny. Brilliant idea from Zack Snyder and David Goyer.

After we see Krypton's destruction, the film decide's to start using it's nonlinear story telling and cut years later to Kal El/Clark Kent as an adult working on a ship and saving everyone there before when it crashes into an oil rig. We learn that Kal-El has been using different aliases and getting different jobs after he's forced to use his powers to save people. We also get a lot of great flashbacks to him as a kid in Smallville. My favorite ones are when his X-Ray vision kicks in during school and his mom tells him to imagine himself on a beautiful and quiet island to calm down, where he has to save the people on the bus when it falls into the water and his dad tells him he has to keep his powers a secret (I know most people hate when Pa Kent says ""Maybe"" when Clark asks him if he should've let everyone die, but I think he responded with that because he honestly didn't know how he felt about that), when Pa Kent finally shows Clark the ship where they found him and tells him he's an alien from another world (Powerful acting from Kevin Costner in this scene BTW), and when Pa Kent is killed by the tornado and he tells his son not to save him since he feels the world isn't ready to know about his powers yet (Not gonna lie, this scene actually made me tear up a little). I know that even several other MOS defenders weren't big fans of the way Pa Kent was handled in this film, but I thought it was brilliant.

Since I've mentioned that Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner are great in this film, let's talk about Michael Shannon as General Zod. Brilliant. Unlike Terrace Stamp's Zod (Who I did like), he's not a one note character. He does have that hate on for Joer-El's son like in the comics and past films, but he's also a guy who is trying to save his race and will do almost anything to do it. And the villains who think they're the heroes are the most freighting since they won't stop no matter what.

Now let's talk about Supes himself Henry Cavill, fantastic. Some people complain that he's wooden. I disagree. I thought he was great and really sold a god trying to find his place in our society. One my favorite moments in the film is when Kal puts on the Superman suit and flies for the first time and the look on Cavill's face is ""Oh my god! Wow. I'm f#cking flying!"". I do wish he has better chemistry with Amy Adams's Lois Lane though. Both give great performances in this film, but I felt like they didn't develop real chemistry until Batman V Superman and fell in love way too fast IMO.

The action in the film is some of the best I've ever seen in a comic book/sci fi film. The fight in Smallville is fantastic and the final battle in Metropolis is great, although I do feel it could've been trimmed down a bit (Like they could've gotten rid of the giant tentacle machine and get to the Zod battle). And the Zod battle is very realistic, that's how a fight between 2 gods would happen. And everyone complains about how Superman was fighting him in a city where innocent people are. Keep this in mind though, Kal/Clark has only been Superman for less than a day and is fighting an experiences solider who said that he's keeping the battle in the city until one of them dies. There are also some really good easter eggs/foreshadowing for BVS in this fight with the Wayne Satellite and the LexCorp logos and the Keep Calm And Call Batman poster.

And of course, there's the whole Superman snapping Zod's neck thing that caused a lot of controversy. I believe he had to do it. There was no other choice. Zod was about to kill an innocent family and every one else on Earth, The Phantom Zone was already closed off, and there's no prison on Earth that could hold him. And Supes didn't want to kill Zod, but he had too and screamed in agony that it came to that and that he killed the only other Kryptonian left.

And before I forget, the score by Hans Zimmer is all kinds of spectacular. Very uplifting, thrilling, and heroic (Perfect for a Superman score). I'll even go as far as to say that I like this score more than the great John Williams's score.

So overall, I love this film and think it deserved much better reviews when it came out. IMO It's a great comic book film, a fantastic sci fi film, a great start to a DC Movie Universe, and an amazing character study about a god in our society with fantastic performances from everyone, great action, amazing score, great cinematography, etc.

I give MOS a 4.5/5. It was my second favorite film of 2013 behind Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners. I do think some of the action in the final battle could've been cut and Kal El and Lois Lane could've had better chemistry (Although I do like their final conversion and the Welcome To The Planet line at the end), but other than that, I think this film is phenomenal and one of the greats of the CBM genre.

What do you think of Man Of Steel? Love it? Hate it? Somewhere in the middle? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"A Nightmare On Elm Street (2010) In Depth Review/Analysis For those who don't know, I used to do some in depth reviews of movies that I like that many people don't or movies that I agree aren't that good/great, but don't think are as bad as others do. I've kind of missed doing them and have decided to bring them back. I updated my first 2 reviews (For Assassin's Creed and Fantastic Four 2015) a couple months ago and here are links to those reviews if you're interested.

Anyways, today's review is the Nightmare On Elm Street remake from 2010. I'll admit that I didn't see any Elm Street film until a few years ago when I did a double feature of the original 1984 film and this remake (No wonder I was kind of scared going to sleep that night) on IFC. They also remain the only films in the franchise I've seen (Aside from the Freddy Vs Jason crossover). 

The original film was a very creative and creepy film with Wes Craven's strong direction, great nightmare setpieces, an amazing score, and Robert Englund's fantastic performance as Freddy Krueger. It lived up to the hype IMO. 

With the remake directed by music video director Samuel Bayer (His only film credit) and produced by Michael Bay and his company, I heard extremely negative things about it before seeing it and was somewhat pleasantly surprised by it. The movie isn't as good as the original and has several big issues, but I don't think it deserves all the hate it gets. Let's talk about why.

The film starts with some pretty creepy opening credits involving kids playing at a pre school and Steve Jablonsky's take on the classic Nightmare theme. His score in the film is quite strong and fits the tone, but the theme is easily the best piece of music in the film IMO. We then transition to a diner at night where Dean (Kellan Lutz) is one of the very tired teenagers. He has a nightmare where he follows a waitress into the kitchen, sees dead pigs, and runs into a man with a black and red striped sweater, a burnt face, and a bladed glove (Jackie Earle Haley). He then wakes up and finds a severe cut on his hand. His friends are also at the diner and when he's left alone again, the burnt man returns and forces him to slit his throat with his knife (Why didn't he just use his glove?) in front of Kris (Katie Cassidy).

After Dean's funeral, Kris begins to experience these odd nightmares as well (Including one in class where the burnt man creepily calls her beautiful) and starts to suspect that there could be some kind of big cover up going on as she discovers a photo of her and Dean having fun as little kids when she initially believed that she didn't meet him or her other friends until they were older. She continues to have these horrific nightmares involving the burnt man and finds more evidence to suggest there is some big mystery/cover up involving her friends. When she's vised by her friend Jesse (Thomas Dekker), she horrified to learn that he's having the exact same nightmares as her so he decides to spend the night with her. This is where she has another nightmare where she finds herself in an abandoned pre school before getting killed by the burnt man. Jesse leaves covered in her blood and manages to warn his friend Nancy (Rooney Mara) of Kris's death and how bad these nightmares are before getting caught by the police and arrested for Kris's murder. He's later killed in his cell by the burnt man (Now known to be named Freddy) after asking him what he wants with him and Freddy angrily asking him if he can turn back time or revive the dead.

Nancy and Quinton (Kyle Gallner) are the only 2 main teens left and are desperately trying to figure out what's going on while trying to stay awake. They are later terrified to learn that soon they'll begin to experience micro naps and start dreaming while they're awake before they go into a coma. Nancy then has a nightmare involving the abandoned pre school after falling asleep in the bathtub (A forced tribute to the original film). Freddy then appears and seems romantically attracted to her. 

Nancy and Quinton eventually learn the full truth from Nancy's mother (Connie Britton) after finding a photo of them and all their friends together for a pre school class photo. They were all best friends since that age and played with a gardener at the school (He also lived there) named Fred Kruger. At first it seemed like he was a sweet guy who loved the kids (Nancy was apparently his favorite), but it turned out to be a facade. The kids parents discovers marks on their bodies and where told that Fred was actually abusing them. The mom tells her daughter and Quinton that Fred left town before she and the other parents could confront him, but Quinton later suffers another nightmare during swim class that reveals that that parents chased down Freddy and that his dad (Clancy Brown) burnt the abandon building he was hiding in down so that he would be killed and the kids would have an easier time forgetting about him instead of having to go to court and tell everyone how Krueger tortured them. Nancy also discovers that every other student in the photo was mysteriously killed, indicated that Freddy wants revenge on them.

This causes Quinton to think there's a chance that his dad and the others may have killed an innocent man considering that no definitive proof was found that Freddy actually abused them. After and incident in a drugstore where Nancy begins to experience dreaming while she's awake, she's taken to the hospital but before they can put her to sleep, she escapes with Quinton to find the pre school. They get there, find Freddy's secret cave, and discover that Freddy did actually abuse them. He isn't out for revenge because they lied. He's out for revenge because they ratted him out.

Nancy comes up with an idea to defeat him by going to sleep and pulling Freddy out of the dream world with her since she was able take a piece of his sweater when she stopped dreaming in the drugstore. Quinton tries to stay awake so that he can be the one to wake her up, but accidentally falls asleep and Freddy starts injuring him, jealous of Nancy being attracted to him. After hearing Nancy though, he goes after her and manages to trap her in a bed and change her outfit to a dress she wore as a kid. Nancy is completely terrified as Freddy continues to creepily flirt with her and blame her for his injuries and death. He then reveals to her that while he wanted to kill all the other kids, he saved her for last and tried to keep her awake for so long that she'll pass out, never wake up again, and forever be his plaything. But before Freddy can hurt her again, Quinton wakes up and injects Nancy with a adrenaline, waking her up and pulling a now powerless Freddy back  to reality.

Freddy is about to kill Quinton, but Nancy cuts his hand off before sitting his throat. She then burns down the school before leaving with Quinton and they are taken the hospital, thinking that now it's finally over. But then we get one final scene where Nancy and her mom arrive home and Freddy appears in a mirror, kills the mom, and drags body through the mirror while Nancy screams. How does that make sense considering Freddy is only supposed to have powers when he's in the dream world? I don't know. Same confusing ending as the original film where Freddy returns.

So yeah, that's the movie we got. It has several issues like mostly bland performances from the teens (Aside from Cassidy and Dekker), poor CGI, a bang you over the head moment where Nancy's mom calls one of the other parents saying that she's figuring out the truth despite the fact that we as the audience already know there's some big cover story, and some forced attempts to pay tribute to the original film (Like the already mentioned hand in the bathtub scene and when Freddy turns into a terrible CGI wall behind Nancy). But it also has some really strong things IMO like Jackie Earle Haley's creepy performance as Freddy (And I thought the make up on him was really good too), Clancy Brown as Quinton's father, some of the nightmare setpieces, the inclusion/use of micro naps, the score, and the fact they went back to a more serious and dark tone. The films isn't great, but I also don't think it deserves to be listed among the worst horror movies of all time (Have you seen Rob Zombie's Halloween 2?).

This version of Freddy is actually what Wes Craven intended him to be. A truly evil killer and child abuser (They had to change the later part due to some actual cases going on at the time). Robert Englund will always be the definitive Freddy Krueger, but Jackie Earle Haley was a great one as well (He's actually one of my favorite actors). He didn't to a cheap Englund impression, but still captured the core aspects of Freddy (Creepy, evil, dark/sadistic sense of humor). He also just plays creeps really well in general like in his Oscar nominated performance in Little Children or as Rorschach in Zack Snyder's adaptation of Watchmen.

The film also has several deleted scenes (Some of which are available on the Blu Ray while others were only in trailers/commercials/featurettes). They include

Freddy making his glove.

Freddy dying in the hospital after being severely burnt.

An alternate opening where Dean dies at a pool party instead of the diner.

Freddy using Kris's blood covered body to taunt Nancy during the climax.

Freddy coming out of Quinton during a nightmare.

An alternate climax where Nancy, Quinton, and Freddy are in a church.

And best of all, an alternate ending where after Freddy traps Nancy on the bed, he reverts back to his regular non burned form which scares Nancy even more and brings back memories of abuse. After Quinton wakes her up and Freddy is brought to reality, he laughs and says that there's nothing Nancy can do because he will always be her nightmare. But before Freddy can strike her, Nancy ultimately faces her greatest fear and beats Freddy with with a bat, severely hurting him, starts setting the place on fire, and destroying his glove. She then repeats what Freddy said to hear a bit earlier (Look at me. Look what you did to me). Freddy is the terrified victim now, but he tries to laugh it off and still call Nancy his. Nancy then tells Freddy to burn and hits a bottle of gasoline with the bat, causing him to burn and die as a scared and twisted man. They then leave the pre school and are sent to the hospital to recover (No dumb ending involving Freddy's return). This ending was so much better than the original. I wonder why they changed it? I'd love to see a director's/alternate cut of this movie one day. Don't know if that will ever happen, but a man can dream.

I give A Nightmare On Elm Street (2010) a 3/5.

What do you guys think about this remake? Love it? Hate it? Somewhere in the middle? What would you like to see in a future Elm Street film (This was supposed to start a new trilogy, but was scrapped after the disappointing reception)? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Batman Unchained Discussion For those of you who don't know, Batman Unchained was the planned sequel to Batman And Robin that would've been released in June of 1999. Unlike Batman Forever and Batman And Robin though, Joel Schumarcher planned on making this one a darker tale with Scarecrow (Played by the one and only Nicolas Cage) as the main villain and Haley Quinn as the secondary antagonist (Though instead of being Joker's lover, she would've been his daughter and a toymaker wanting revenge on Batman for her father's death). Akivia Goldsman (Who wrote the previous 2 films) did not write the screenplay for the proposed film. Instead, writing duties were given to Mark Protosevich (I Am Legend). The film would've also included Batman and Robin having an estranged relationship, Scarecrow and Harley teaming up to drive Batman mad, and the return of Joker, Penguin, Two Face, and Riddler via Scarecrow's fear toxin as the put Batman on trial. The film was also planned to be the grand finale to that Batman franchise

However, the film was quickly scrapped after Batman And Robin was released in 1997 and was universally panned (Rightfully so) and was a box office disappointment. It's probably for the best this got cancelled considering what we got years later (The Dark Knight Trilogy), but I'm not going to lie. If WB were actually willing to make this a darker film and not another bloated toy commercial, this could've maybe made for a good film (Although I would change the part about Harley being Joker's daughter). 

Even though the film was never produced, aspects of the script/story did make it's way into some other Batman stories. Batman Begins (Which had Scarecrow as a villain) had that great scene where Bruce Wayne returns to the cave and confronts his fear of bats. That was intended to be the final scene of Unchained.

But what the Batman story that really seemed to have taken inspiration from Unchained was the 2015 video game Batman Arkham Knight. Both stories include Scarecrow as the main villain, Harley Quinn as a supporting villain teaming up with him, Batman having a kind of estranged relationship with Robin, a pretty dark tone, the return of a deceased Joker via Scarecrow's toxin, a moment where several of Baman's other villains confront him via the toxin, and true endings to the series.

What do you think of the idea of Batman Unchained. Do you think it could've redeemed the series so that it could go out on a high note? Or would it have been another Batman And Robin like disaster? How do you feel about Batman Begins and Arkham Knight possibly taking some inspiration from it? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Favorite Guilty Pleasure Films? We all have some films that we know aren't the best made films, but we still love them. Here are some of my picks.

Also, I'm not including films like The Room, Troll 2, Birdemic, etc. Those are horrible films that I also enjoy watching, but to me a guilty pleasure isn't always a so bad it's amazing film. I also don't consider movies that we think are good that others disagree with to be guilty pleasures. To me it's a film that you know isn't the best, but you still love it like it's a great film.

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie (1995)- I remember watching this movie so much on DVD with my brother when we were little kids. We watched Power Rangers a lot and we felt like this was the greatest film of all time back then. Watching it now, it's a terrible film with even worse effects than the show, but I still love it. We get some hilarious over the top action scenes with the Rangers and one of the most ridiculous villains of all time with Ivan Ooze (Played by Rene Belloq). A most own 90's classic that's being released on Blu Ray soon.

Con Air- Back when Nic Cage was a big action star. In this film, Cage speaks in a southern accent, fights a villain named Cyrus The Virus, has the best smile and wink to the camera (With Sweet Home Alabama playing over that moment in the credits), and beats up a guy for not putting a stuffed bunny down. What more could you possibly ask for?

Ghost Rider Spirit Of Vengeance- Another Nic Cage film makes my list. I know people completely hated this film and consider it one of the worst CBM ever made. I disagree. It isn't the best made film, but it's also far from the worst of the superhero genre and is really crazy and entertaining. We get a more vicious Rider compared to the first film, better CGI, Nic Cage being Nic Cage (SCRAPING AT THE DOOR!), weird and awesome action scenes from the Crank/Mom And Dad directors, etc. I kind of wish Sony kept the GH rights and made a sequel.

What would your top picks be? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Happy Birthday Jon Schnepp Today (May 16) would've been the 52nd birthday of director/writer/film pundit Jon Schnepp. There's a reason he was refereed to as ""The King Of The Sweaties"". He was so passionate about the things he loved (Films, comics, superheros, horror, animation, etc) and spread that joy, knowledge, laughter, and excitement to others and had a lot of talent making movies and shows as shown with Metalocalypse and The Death Of Superman Lives What Happened. Every fandom needs more people like him. I still miss him a lot.

I've never cried due to a celebrity passing until his death last year. It felt like loosing a close friend and no one should pass away at age 51. Not only was Schnepp incredibly smart, a gifted filmmaker, hilarious, passionate about nerd culture, and from all accounts one of the nicest people on the planet, he also helped me overcome a lot of demons. I discovered AMC Movie Talk back in 2013 while dealing with a ton of anxiety that I didn't really understand and that show and it's cast like Schnepp eventually helped me get better at dealing with it and sparked my love for movies, cartoons, and storytelling in general. If it wasn't for Schnepp, I honestly don't know what my main passion would be.

So today let's celebrate Schnepp's B Day by sharing some of our favorite on camera moments with him, his great body of work, and just fandom in general. He taught me (And others) a valuable lesson. Never be afraid to express your love of something and be loud and proud about it.

Thank you Jon Schnepp. For everything. I hope you've been hanging out with Stan Lee and Jack Kirby a lot in Heaven and have been able to watch all of the upcoming big movies many many times before us. :0)"
3,"Ranking The Predator Films 1. Predator (1987)- Whenever the topic of best action movie comes up, my picks are always Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Mad Max Fury Road, and the original Predator. Not only is this a thrilling action movie, it's also an intense sci fi thriller. You don't actually see the Predator in this film a lot, but that's okay because it adds to the suspense and makes his reveal at the end more awesome (Some of the best creature design ever BTW). John McTiernan (Who later went on to direct Die Hard) directed this film perfectly. It's incredibly tight and focused with a charismatic and likable cast and very well timed (And awesome) one liners. I'm not trying to say that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jesse Ventura should be acting in Macbeth and stuff, but in this film they were perfect. Plus it has an amazing score from Alan Silvestri and the most awesome hand shake in film history (Dillon! You son of a bitch!). 5/5

2. Predator 2 (1990)- This film was initially a failure when it was released but later developed a cult following and I'm glad it has. This movie is nowhere near as good as the first film, but it's pretty entertaining IMHO. Danny Glover is a likable lead, I like the change of setting from the jungle to LA, you get some awesome Predator kill scenes and you get to learn a bit more about there lore (And you get that Xenomorph skull easter egg near the end), and while Bill Paxton and Gary Buesy are basically cartoon characters here, I'm still entertained by them (Especially Paxton). 3.5/5

3. Predators (2010)- I love this movie's premise. Different people get trapped on a planet where the Predators are hunting them for more of their games. Yes some parts of the film are drag on, Topher Grace's turn at the end felt forced to me, and Adrian Brody's Royce trying to pay tribute to the classic ""Come On! Kill Me!"" moment felt off, but it's still an interesting film with good performances and action. I would've liked to have seen a direct sequel to this film instead of what we got last year. 3.5/5

4. Alien Vs Predator (2004)- Paul W.S. Anderson is usually not a good director to me (I had to turn off Resident Evil The Final Chapter and The Three Musketeers), but he's also made some fun guilty pleasures like the 1995 Mortal Kombat film and the first AVP. This isn't one of the best films in either franchise, but's also not one of the worst IMO (The AVP films are also non canon). The characters in the film are passable but not great and the lead girl and The Predator teaming up at the end felt kind of off to me, but I actually do like the history of the Xenomorphs, The Predators, and the Pyramid, some scenes involving the characters getting trapped are actually kind of suspenseful, and the fights between the Xenomorphs and Predators are pretty cool. Yes I know people were mad about the PG-13 rating and while I do agree that films in the Alien and Predator franchises should be rated R due to their DNA, the PG-13 rating for AVP 1 didn't ruin the film for me and it's actually pretty violent for a PG-13 film. I wouldn't call this film a really good movie, but it's fun. 3/5

5. The Predator (2018)- I think Shane Black is a really talented guy. I thought The Nice Guys was one of the best films of 2016 and deserved more love. So that combined with the fact that he was in the original Predator as Hawkins made me pretty excited to see this new film. Sadly, it ended up being a sloppy, unfunny, mess with mostly poor CGI. I actually thought the movie started okay and some of the action is fine, but it quickly falls apart after the opening scene and the story becomes really stupid (It includes Predator dogs and a poor use of Autism) with terrible characters who tell bad and poorly timed jokes. It also feels like several parts of the movie have been cut out or rearranged (And you can obviously tell Act 3 was changed a lot). And of course the movie ends with one of the dumbest things in the franchise. The Iron Predator (I mean The Predator Killer). 1.5/5

6. Aliens Vs Predator Requiem (2007)- The worst film in both franchises IMO. They allowed this movie to filled with terrible characters you would find in a bad slasher film, horrible dialogue, not enough Alien and Predator stuff, awful/forced tributes to previous films, and maybe the worst lighting I've ever seen in a big franchise. Sure it's Rated R this time, but that doesn't matter when your whole movie sucks (They even take the violence too far in the film at times). 0.5/5

But's that's just my ranking. What would your's be? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Hasbro Cinematic Universe? I'll admit that I am somewhat tired of hugely interconnected shared universe. It's great that MCU has a lot of fans (Even though I think some of their recent films are overrated) and I'm really looking forward to Godzilla Vs Kong next year (Team Kong all the way), but I personally prefer for big film franchises to focus less on how all the films connect to each other and just making the films good on their own (Like what Fox did with their X-Men films and it looks like DC and Sony will be taking that approach as well with DC and the Venomverse). We've seen many attempts to set up a larger universe backfire like The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Ghostbusters 2016, The Mummy, and Transformers The Last Knight (One of the worst films I've seen in awhile). And yet, the people over at Paramount and Hasbro might be thinking to try and launch an even bigger Hasbro movie universe.

According to the Youtube Channel Midnight's Edge (Which covers a lot of big franchise film production and studio politics), Hasbro may tease a connection to last year's Bumblebee film in the upcoming G.I. Joe spin off focused on Snake Eyes by saying that Jon Cena's Sector 7 general was the first G.I. Joe.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c00Tx3rSfks

I know Bumblebee turned out to be great and brought excitement back to the Transformers franchise. So that's why they should just continue that series and maybe make some other TF films that don't really crossover (Like the rumored Cybertron prequel). But instead, there's now a possibility may make a giant universe not just with Transformers, but with other Hasbro properties. I know Transformers and G.I. Joe have some crossover history in comics, but I don't think that would work well on film.

Also, what else would they put in this universe besides Transformers and G.I. Joe based films? Would wee see Optimus Prime get trapped in Equestria and team up with the Mane Six from My Little Pony? Would we see G.I. Joes get sent to the Command Center and team up with Power Rangers (Which Hasbro acquired last year). Maybe, but why? Stuff like this could be cool as animated specials or comics (There actually was a planned Transformers/MLP crossover comic that was cancelled), but not in a big film franchise IMHO.

What do you think of the idea of a shared universe based on Hasbro's properties? Good or bad idea? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Filmmaker Driven Superhero Movies This is something I've been meaning to post for awhile and I feel like now is the perfect time considering Avengers Endgame is almost here, the behind the scenes drama about the Hellboy shoot getting out, the amazing Joker trailer from a couple weeks ago, etc. 

Like a lot of people, I love good comic book movies and I used to love the MCU as a whole a few years ago, but as I've gotten older my opinions on the MCU have changed. I still like/love some of their films like the original Iron Man, the first Thor, and Guardians 1, but I've also been really disappointed by their last few films like Guardians 2, Spider-Man Homecoming, Thor Ragnarok, etc and one of the big reasons why is because the Marvel formula is getting stale IMHO. Some people jokingly call the MCU the greatest/most expensive TV show being produced right now with Kevin Feige as the showrunner and they kind of have a point. It feels kind of like a TV show where the producers and in house writers have far more creative say than the directors. And because we have an MCU that's so producer driven and concerned with how all the movies connect, that can limit creativity. A prime example of this is Edgar Wright's scrapped Ant-Man film. Many were excited that the director of Shaun Of The Dead and Scott Pilgrim would be directing a superhero movie (Myself included), but because Wright's vision and style didn't fit into the larger MCU, he left.

Meanwhile, other studios that have made movies based on Marvel/DC properties have allowed their superhero movies to be more filmmaker driven and for the directors to put their fingerprints on the movies. Look at Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films (Even Spider-Man 3, with it's forced inclusions of Venom and Gwen Stacy, still fills like a Raimi film), Tim Miller's original Deadpool, Guillermo Del Toro's Hellboy films, James Mangold's Logan, Patty Jenkins's Wonder Woman, Zack Snyder's Watchmen, Man Of Steel, and Batman V Superman (Love or hate those films, those were HIS films), etc (And if that trailer is any indication, Todd Phillips's Joker). They're able to do this because they don't make hugely interconnected franchises like the MCU. The Fox X-Men films (Which will be ending soon sadly) don't care that much about the overall continuity and just focus on the movie they're making and with DC, they're now focusing on just stand alone solo films.

But it's not just about the MCU formula. We also have had some big instances where studio meddling has ruined superhero films. Prime examples of this include

WB going over budget on Green Lantern and kicking Martin Campbell out of the editing room, firing the original directors of Jonah Hex and instead cobbling together a horrible mess of a film, having a trailer company edit Suicide Squad without David Ayer, and having Joss Whedon reshoot large portions of Zack Snyder's Justice League.

Lionsgate and the producers of Hellboy (2019) screwing over Neil Marshall by firing the cinematographer and taking the film away from him.

Marvel forcing Jon Favreau all that unnecessary Avengers set up in Iron Man 2.

Sony forcing Marc Webb to put in all that Sinister Six set up and sub plots in The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

20th Century Fox micro managing Gavin Hood during the production of X-Men Origins Wolverine and ruining Josh Trank's original cut of Fantastic Four (2015).

So yeah, I personally believe that we need more filmmaker driven CBM for the genre to continue going for years to come. But what do you guys think? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading."
3,"Why I'm Looking Forward To Dark Phoenix The upcoming X-Men film Dark Phoenix has gotten a lot of pre release hate ever since it was first announced (And it amped up after the Disney/Fox merger was confirmed). But I actually have a good amount of hope for the film (Second most anticipated CBM of the year behind Joker for me) and here's why.

1. I'm glad they're adapting the Dark Phoenix storyline again- The Dark Phoenix story is great and has so much cinematic potential. They obviously tried adapting it in X-Men 3 (As a B plot) and it didn't really work out. So far IMHO, this looks like a much better adaptation of the story (And it will have a cosmic element this time).

2. James Mcavoy and Michael Fassbender as Xavier and Magneto- The whole cast for this film is great (Jessica Chaistain, Nicholas Hoult, Even Peters, etc), but the 2 big guns to me are Mcavoy and Fassbender as Xavier and Erik and this will be our last chance to see them in these roles. They're 2 of the best actors working today and have crushed these roles in the previous 3 films (I actually think Mcavoy's performance in DOFP was kind of award worthy and that the scene in Apocalypse where Magneto's daughter dies is one of the best acted scenes in a CBM thanks to Fassbender). Plus it would be great for Fassbender to have another critical hit as he hasn't one since 2015 when Steve Jobs and Macbeth came out (Even though I personally find his Assassin's Creed movie highly underrated).

3. Good trailers- So far the trailers have gotten a mixed reaction, but I've personally enjoyed them. The first one was pretty good for a first teaser and the second one was fantastic IMO. I like the darker tone they're going for and the struggle our lead mutants will have (Do we try to save Jean grey from this Phoenix Force, or kill her?). Some people are saying it looks too similar to X3, but remember that in X3 the Dark Phoenix storyline was B plot to the mutant cure main story. In this film, DP actually is the central story.

4. Musical score by Hans Zimmer- What else can I say. It's Hans Zimmer scoring an X-Men film. The guy who scored The Dark Knight Trilogy, Man Of Steel, The Lion King, Pirates Of The Caribbean, The Ring, The Rock, Inception, The Last Samurai, Interstellar, Gladiator, 12 Years A Slave, Dunkirk, etc.

5. The end of a great era- This will be the last main X-Men film released in this franchise before Disney announces a reboot in the MCU a few years from now (Not very excited about that). This saddens me since I think Fox has done a fantastic job with all of their X-Universe films aside from X3 and Wolverine Origins (X-Men Days Of Future Past is also my favorite CBM of all time), and were willing to give us different kinds of comic book adaptations (Like DOFP, Logan, Deadpool, and Legion if you want to count TV) besides the usual Marvel formula will get out of Disney. But since we can't stop this merger, all I can do now is hope this film is good and ends the series on a high note with no major cliffhangers.

So there you go. I still believe this movie could end up being pretty good. I obviously won't know that for sure until I see it, but I still have hope. What do you think? Agree or disagree? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Why Don't Some People Understand That All Film Is Subjective? I believe the the online film fan community would be a much better place if everyone got this. There is no such thing as an objectively good or bad movie, Movies are meant to give us an experience and because we all have different tastes and opinions, we'll each have different experiences with the same film (Some positive, some negative). 

Some people like to make fun of people who dislike a film that's beloved or considered a classic or love a movie that is divisive or wildly hated. This is ridiculous. Because all film is subjective, we'll all have several films where we disagree with the general consensus. For example, I don't like Roma, Fences, Citizen Kane, Halloween, Moulin Rouge, Spider-Man Homecoming, and Thor Ragnarok and I really like/love Man Of Steel, Batman V Superman, Assassin's Creed, Venom, Ghost Rider Spirit Of Vengeance, Only God Forgives, and Hook. Plus, the most famous film critic of all time (Roger Ebert) gave a negative review to the action movie classic Die Hard and no one complains about that. How boring would film fandom be if we all had the same points of view on all films?

I also believe the lack of understanding that all film is subjective leads to toxic fandom. I hate most of Michael Bay's Transformers films, but I would never call someone stupid or say they have bad taste in films if they loved them. I've seen real fans of Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Ghostbusters, My Little Pony, Harry Potter, etc get insulted because of trolls and morons who don't get it.

What do you think? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"In Depth Review/Analysis Of Assassin's Creed (2016) Assassin's Creed has been an interesting film for me. I was really excited to see it because of how great the concept and world sounded and the extremely talented cast and director (At that time, I hadn't played any of the games and only knew the basic concept. I've since played some of the first one and it's good.). I saw the film on opening day after reading and watching a lot of the awful reviews and went in with lowered expectations. But surprisingly, me and my grandmother (Who knew absolutely nothing about AC) kind of enjoyed it. I still remembering feeling a little disappointed though and I gave the film a 2.5/5. But the film never left my head and the more I thought about it, the more I appreciated it despite it's problems and it's become one of my favorite films to rewatch.

I want to talk about what worked, what didn't work, what was cut, and the future of the franchise. Before I start though, I want to make something clear. My goal with this post isn't to say ""I'm right and all the haters just didn't get it"". I'm just posting my personal opinion and explaining why I feel this way. You can agree or disagree with it and that's fine. All film is subjective and that's the best thing about the movies and film fandom. :0)

With all that said, let's get started!

The film starts off really well with an opening text and crawl telling us all about how the Assassins have protected the Apple Of Eden from the Knights Of Templar for centuries. We also get our first taste of the fantastic score by Jed Kurzel (Brother of the film's director Justin Kurzel and one of the best composers working today). It goes from a very haunting theme (Similar to his Macbeth score) to a drum beating action suspense theme throughout the film and it's really well done. My personal favorite tracks on the album are Young Cal, You're Not Alone, and Future Glory. We then get are first scene with Aguilar being accepted into the Creed and we sense that he and Maria have a very close and romantic relationship.

Once we cut to 1976, I felt that the choice in music felt really out of place. Entrance Song by The Black Angels isn't a bad song (It's actually quite good), but it doesn't feel like a good fit for this type of film. I would've preferred if they used a score track instead of a song. I also feel like there was a big missed opportunity in this scene to show what happened to Callum Lynch after he escaped from the Abstergo team. We find out later in the film that he was a big troublemaker as a teen and that he was arrested for killing a pimp. Why didn't they show us that? And why did he kill this pimp? According to the AC Movie Novelization (Which is a fun read and a bit better than the movie IMO due to some stuff feeling more fleshed out), Cal developed a deep hatred for men who beat/abuse women because of his father killing his mother and he murdered a man who was abusing an underage prostitute. Because of that and his previous criminal record, he was sentenced to death on his birthday. They shouldn't have cut that out.

When I originally saw the film, I thought all the performances were very good except for Marion Cotillard as Sofia Rikkin. It surprised me because she's obviously a great actress, but I felt like she was just going through the motions. But rewatching the film, I feel like her performance and the character weren't the problem, I feel like it was the script having her being kind of an exposition machine (Mainly when she's first introduced). Expositional dialogue isn't always bad and it's sometimes needed in films like this, but if you overuse it, it can start to feel kind of annoying/tired.

One character that I feel was very underused was Moussa. Michael K Williams (Who was awesome as Freddy in HBO's The Night Of) is great in the role and has a lot of charisma, but I wish that we got to see Moussa and the other Abstergo prisoners interact with Lynch more so that when they come together at the end of the film and protect the apple, it feels more real and believable.

Most people agree that the best scenes in the movie are the scenes in 1492 where we get to see all of the big Assassin action and lore and that more of the film should've taken place there. I agree. These scenes are really well done. Adam Akrapaw does a great job with the cinematography and Justin Kurzel's visual style that he used in Macbeth works really well in these scenes. Most of the fights and chase scenes are also really impressive (All of it is real BTW, no CGI). I used to have a problem with the film cutting back in forth to Aguilar being a badass to Callum in the Animus, but I've grown to appreciate the choice more. Yes, some of the action scenes in the past have the quick cut editing that I hate (Thankfully no shaky camera though), and that bothered me, but there's still a lot of terrific action to make up for that. I also really liked the romance between Aguilar and Maria. It felt genuine and the actors had really good chemistry. You do feel something when Maria tells Aguilar to let her die so that the apple can be protected and the Creed can live on and when Aguilar just starts beating the Templar who killed his beloved (And his entire family according to the novelization).

Another one of the films best scenes is when Cal reunites with his father and the heartbreaking truth is revealed. Joseph Lynch was asked by his wife to murder both her and Cal so that Abstergo couldn't capture them and locate the Apple. But killing his wife was just too much so he told Cal to run away. Fassbender and Gleeson are incredible in this scene and it shows how damaged Cal really is. 

One scene that felt really out of place though was Callum singing ""I'm Crazy"" right before he's hooked up into the Animus. I get that's the song that played when he saw that his mother was dead. But it just feels really out of place in a movie about Assassins and Templars. And if you want to hear Fassbender sing, go watch the movie Frank (Underrated gem).

Speaking of Michael Fassbender, I already mentioned that everyone does a really good job in this film, but Fassbender really sells being both a mentally disturbed man and a badass Master Assassin. One small moment in the film that I didn't notice on first viewing was that when Sofia is explaining where he is, he just starts to smile and laugh and have that ""What the F am I listening too?"" face. He's one of my favorite actors working today and his performance got me to really care about Cal.

About the last scenes in the film, some people thought it felt too quick. I do agree with that. I feel like it could've been extended a bit and show us Cal, Moussa, and the others getting to know each other more while tracking down Jeremy Irons's Alan Rikkin. I don't have a problem with the way Alan is killed though. I know some people wanted a bigger final battle, but in reality there's no way Alan could beat Cal and the others in a fight. And with the shot of Cal jumping off the building, I prefer the deleted scene version where the other assassins jumped first and and Cal stands still, looking a little unsure, but then he sees a vision of his mother and is reminded about his destiny and finally jumps of the roof and accepts it. Great ending and the one that should've been in the film IMO.

Speaking of deleted scenes, let's talk about some of them.

The biggest surprise was that they removed an entire character from the film. A teenager named Lara, a descendant of Maria and an adoptive daughter to Sophia. I felt like this character added a lot of nice emotional moments in the film with Cal and Sofia and shouldn't have been cut IMO.

There's also a scene where The Bleeding Effect (Which works very well in the film BTW) causes Callum to not only see his ancestor, but the ancestors of Moussa and the other prisoners. Pretty cool and a nice scene for fans of the games since these ancestors are characters from the greater franchise.

There's an alternate ending where all of the prisoners are killed except for Cal and he escapes from Abstergo alone. I feel like it was a good idea to change this because it would've felt very abrupt.

And finally, there's one where Joseph actually fights off the guards at the end, dies in front of his son, and Cal (Now knowing the full truth about his mother's death) forgives him. Cal and the others than say the oath of the Creed. I feel like this was a better death scene for Joseph than the one in the final cut. We get to actually see him fight, it's a better way to end Cal's hatred of him, and gives Brendan Gleeson a little more to do in the film.

Could we ever see an extended cut of this film? I wouldn't bet my money on it, but it's possible. Justin Kurzel revealed in a Reddit AMA that the original cut was close to 2 hours and 25 minutes. The actual film is an hour and 48 minutes including the end credits. And I heard from some fans who went to one of the premieres that the film was originally 20-25 minutes longer (And may or may not have including a kiss scene between Cal and Sofia). Some might say that an extended cut won't happened because of the film being panned, but that didn't stop films like Kingdom Of Heaven, Sucker Punch, the Rob Zombie Halloween remake, and Alexander from getting director's/extended cuts (I think Alexander has 4 different cuts).

As far as sequel chances go, it's unlikely. Most critics and audience members hated the film and while it made a little over 240 million dollars worldwide, it cost 125 million dollars to make (Not counting marketing) and that means the film sadly lost a lot of money. So I guess we'll never know for sure if that assassin that looked like Sofia means that she and Cal are somehow related. Than again, stranger things have happened, so you can't say never. We do know that Adi Shaker is working on an AC animated series for Netflix. That could be interesting considering he also developed the Castlevania show on Netflix. And maybe since Disney owns 20th Century Fox now, they can partner up with Ubisoft again and give the Assassin's Creed lore another shot on film.

So overall, I really like this film. It has problems, but for me the good outweighs the bad and I don't think it deserves the hate it gets. It's definitely one of the best video game films ever made (Maybe the best along with 2018's Tomb Raider) and compared to films like Super Mario Brothers, House Of The Dead, and Mortal Kombat Annihilation, it's a masterpiece. I feel like this movie could've been better though if some tweaks were made the the script and some scenes were put back in, but I still enjoy it and it made me a big Justin Kurzel fan (Very excited for The True History Of The Kelly Gang).

My score has gone up to a 3.5/5.

3,"What Happened To Shane Acker's Thomas The Tank Engine Film? Back in 2011, it was reported that Shane Acker (Director of the highly underrated PG-13 animated film 9) would helm another big screen adaptation of Thomas The Tank Engine. I always felt like that was an interesting choice (Going from a dark post apocalyptic animated film to a fun children's film with talking trains), but I was curious about it. I watched Thomas a lot when I was a little kid, played with the toy trains, and saw the 2000 film Thomas And The Magic Railroad with Peter Fonda and Alec Baldwin (Which I enjoyed as a kid, but haven't seen in many years and eventually learned that a lot of people hated it). But ever since then, nothing. Why do you think this film died? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,What's Going On With The Kung Fury Movie? So last year it got announced that Michael Fassbender would star in (And produce) a feature film sequel to the awesome cheesefest short film Kung Fury along with Arnold Schwarzenegger and David Hasselhoff and that filming would begin in September (Yay). Well here we are now and still no new updates on the film. Is it dead or has some new announcement come out that I'm just not aware of. Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)
3,"With The Disney/Fox Deal Closing Days From Now, What Are Your Final Thoughts On It? Disclaimer- This Isn't an attack on Disney. I think they are a good company overall and I love a lot of their animated movies and shows like almost all of the Pixar films, Lion King, Beauty And The Beast, Moana, Zootopia, Gravity Falls, Star Vs The Forces Of Evil, etc and even what they've done with the Star Wars movies so far.

I think it's very disappointing that one of the biggest movie studios is  being sold. That means that lots of people will lose their jobs and that we'll get less movies every year. And while Fox has put out some crap (As all studios do), they've also but out some great stuff. Here's some of the really good/great films they've put out this decade

X-Men First Class

X-Men Days Of Future Past (Best CBM ever made IMO)

Deadpool 1 and 2

The Wolverine

Logan (First CBM to get a screenplay nom at the Oscars)

The Shape Of Water (Best Picture Winner)

Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri (Nominated for Best Picture)

Bohemian Rhapsody (Nominated for Best Picture)

Kingsman The Secret Service 

Chronicle

Black Swan (Nominated for Best Picture)

Life Of Pi (Nominated for Best Picture)

12 Years A Slave (Best Picture Winner)

The Martian (Nominated for Best Picture)

The Planet Of The Apes Trilogy (Rise, Dawn, and War) (One of the best trilogies of all time)

Birdman (Best Picture Winner)

Eddie The Eagle

The Revenant (Nominated for Best Picture)

Gone Girl

And I even really liked/appreciated Kingsman The Golden Circle, Assassin's Creed, The Greatest Showman, X-Men Apocalypse, and Prometheus/Alien Covenant.

Some people say that one of the big reasons Fox is selling is because they feel like they wouldn't be able to compete in the streaming wars. But with big franchises like X-Men, Wolverine, Deadpool, Alien, Die Hard, Predator, Avatar, Planet Of The Apes, Kingsman, etc and TV shows like Simpsons, Family Guy, Bob's Burgers, X-Files, Legion, Sons Of Anarchy, Atlanta, Orville, etc, I disagree. Plus like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Disney Plus, and Apple, they could also create their own original successful shows.

3,"Why Do People Dislike The First Acts Of Venom And Christopher Robin? IMO, Venom and Christopher Robin were 2 of 2018's most underrated films. Christopher Robin was sweet modern version of Hook with a Winnie The Pooh skin in place of the Peter Pan one, and Venom was a really fun film and gave us a much more faithful adaptation of the character than Spider-Man 3 did. Venom deserved better critically IMO and Christopher Robin deserved better financially (I believe it lost Disney money).

With that being said, two common criticisms I've heard with both of these films (From people who like and dislike the films) is that the first acts are kind of rough and/or boring and that it takes too long to get to the cool stuff (Pooh and the gang with Christopher and Eddie Brock with the symbiote). I personally disagree. I didn't mind having to wait for adult Christopher Robin to reunite with his stuffed childhood friends or for Venom to fully show up. I felt like they were paced just fine and we got to know the characters of Christopher Robin and Eddie Brock well.

But that's just my opinion. What's yours? Why did you like/dislike the first act for these movies and what did you think of the films overall? Am I missing something? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Anticipation For The Breaking Bad Movie? I just finished the series and absolutely loved it (I give it my highest score of 5/5. The best live action show I've ever seen). So I'm very excited about this film. Showrunner Vince Gilligan is coming back to write and direct the film and it will reveal Jesse Pinkman's fate after the series finale. Yeah he escaped from the Neo-Nazis, but he's far from being a free man. Another report I saw says that we may see some deceased characters from the series return like Walter, Mike, and Jane. My guess is that these characters will probably appear in flashbacks and/or dream sequences that Jesse has since he had close relationships with all of them.

What do you think of Sony and AMC making this movie? Are you excited or skeptical? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Will The 2020 Bob's Burgers Movie Be Impacted By The Forthcoming Disney/Fox Merger A movie based on Fox's animated comedy Bob's Burgers (Which is hilarious BTW) is scheduled to be released next year on July 17 (And will have to compete with another cartoon based film in the third Spongebob film). But with the Disney/Fox merger about to be completed soon, I wonder how this will impact the film. Since the film is in production, it will be released but I wonder if it will be delayed or maybe moved to Hulu or something like that. I hope that doesn't happen as I want to see this movie on the big screen.

3,"Certified Rotten Movies Of The 2010's That You Like/Love? Since all film is subjective, we all have some movies that were divisive or critically panned that we actually really enjoy (And vice versa of coarse). I would like to know some movies that have come out since 2010 that are certified rotten on Rotten Tomatoes, but you either liked or loved. Here are some of my personal choices.

Dinner For Schmucks (42%)- Tragically underrated comedy IMO. Yes, the actual dinner at the end is kind of disappointing as well as Zach Galifianakis's role, but Paul Rudd and Steve Carell's amazing chemistry really carries the film and it has a lot of funny moments IMO (""He's best friends with Morgan Freeman!"")

Legend Of The Guardians The Owls Of Ga'Hoole (51%)- One of the best animated films this decade and Zack Snyder's second best film behind Man Of Steel. It does such a great job at taking the first 3 books of the Guardians series and adapting them into a movie that tells the classic hero's journey story with beautiful animation. Sad we never got a sequel with Kludd as the new Metal Beak.

Ghost Rider Spirit Of Vengeance (18%)- I know most people seem to think the second Ghost Rider film is worse than the first film. I disagree. The first movie was a weak movie overall with some really terrible things (Blackheart, some of the CGI) and some really cool things (The Ghost Rider stuff, an awesome soundtrack). But this sequel/reboot hybrid gave us a crazy, weird, and crazy B Movie helmed by the directors of Crank with much better effects, villains, and Ghost Rider action than the first film and some glorious Nicolas Cage moments (""SCRAPING AT THE DOOR!"").

Man Of Steel (56%)- I was never a huge Superman films until MOS came out. I never disliked him or anything, but he was never one of my favorite superheroes (My personal 3 favorites are Spider-Man, Batman, and Venom) and while the first 2 Reeve films were good for their time, I never loved them (And the other 2 films are just awful). But when I saw MOS in 2013, it moved me. It was a great sci fi film about a god like being trying to find his place in our world and has 2 different father figures who have different desires for him (One wants him to become Earth's Savior while the other just wants him to be a good man). My favorite Zack Snyder film and my second favorite superhero film right behind X-Men Days Of Future Past.

Only God Forgives (40%)- Nicholas Winding Refn is a very interesting and brilliant filmmaker. Films like Bronson and Drive are excellent and while I wouldn't call Only God Forgives excellent or great, I still enjoyed it. Yes it has some story issues and some of the brutal violence is unnecessary IMO, but it's a beautifully shot film with great ambition and performances.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2014 (22%)- I was expecting this movie to suck just as much (Maybe even worse) as 2014's Transformers Age Of Extinction. While the movie wasn't great, it wasn't horrible either IMO. I never read the original comics or saw much of the cartoons, but I thought the 2014 reboot was kind of fun and I liked the bromance chemistry the Turtles had. Sucks that the 2016 sequel was crap.

Dracula Untold (24%)- Other than the forced ending that Universal put in to potentially connect it to the Dark Universe, I thought this was a pretty cool origin story for Dracula. Not the best Dracula film ever made, but solid.

Chappie (33%)- While Die Antwoord's performances were crap, I thought this was a pretty fun and interesting film with great performances from Hugh Jackman, Dev Patel, and Sharlto Copley as Chappie. No where near as good as District 9, but still solid.

Tomorrowland (50%)- I remember being amazed by the teaser trailer for Tomorrowland where Britt Robinson picks up the pin and is instantly transported to the other world. It looked very imaginative and while many may disagree, I found most of the movie to be that as well. Sure it was clunky and weird in certain places, but the good outweighed the bad for me.

Batman V Superman Dawn Of Justice (27%)- I don't know if I've ever been more excited to see a movie more than I was for BVS. I'm a fan of Zack Snyder, I loved MOS, and we were finally seeing DC's Titans on screen together. I'll admit that I was very disappointed in the theatrical cut due to clunky editing and scene transitions. But after I saw the Ultimate Cut on Blu ray, my mind started to change and the more I watch it the more I like it. MOS and Watchmen are still the better films to me, but Snyder once again managed to make a very complex CBM.

X-Men Apocalypse (48%)- I love Fox's X-Men franchise and I'm sad that it's ending after Dark Phoenix and New Mutants come out. Other than X-Men Last Stand and X-Men Origins Wolverine, I like/love every film in the franchise and that includes Apocalypse. Apocalypse has several structure problems, a disappointing final battle, and a villain that needed some more development and screentime. But it also had some great stuff like Mcavoy and Fassbender once again delivering great performances (The scene where Magneto loses is one of the best acted scenes I've ever seen in a CBM), another awesome Quicksilver scene, and the introduction to younger versions of the classic X-Men.

The Accountant (51%)- As someone with autism, I thought Ben Affleck's portrayal of the autistic Christian Wolff was fantastic and that the whole film was an excellent character driven thriller. It could've easily gone wrong and been very flat and boring, but thanks to Gavin O'Conner's (Who also made the excellent Warrior) direction, the performances of Affleck, Anna Kendrick, J.K. Simmons, John Lithgow, and Jon Bernthal, and the fitting slower pace, we got an underrated gem of 2016.

Passengers (30%)- I'm sucker for movies like this, Cast Away, Apollo 13, and The Martian where you a character or several characters isolated and having to survive with no ways to contact others. In Passengers, we get the usually likable Chris Pratt who makes a terrible and selfish choice to wake Jennifer Lawrence up early just so that he wouldn't die alone. Very interesting story to me.

Assassin's Creed (17%)- This is the film that made me a fan of director Justin Kurzel (Who worked with Fassbender before on Macbeth which I also enjoyed). Unlike most video game based films, you can tell that the director and actors were trying to give us a movie that would be able to transcend it's video game origins with great worldbuilding, terrific performances, an awesome soundtrack, and beautiful cinematography and set and costume designs. Most people seem to like the scenes in the past but find the present day scenes boring, but I was interested in Callum Lynch's redemption/origin story. I will admit though that the novelization is better because it does flesh more things out and has several moments not present in the final product (Would love to see the director's cut). I wish this film did better and got a sequel since I considered this the best video game movie ever made until Tomb Raider came out.

Power Rangers (47%)- I grew up with the original Power Rangers show (And the amazingly terrible 1995 Power Rangers movie with Rene Bellog as Ivan Ooze) and this film did a great job adapting the Power Rangers lore for modern audiences while still keeping the core elements of the series. The movie also did an amazing job of giving us characters to route for and care about. I loved the Rangers in this film (And we got Walter White as Zordon for Heaven's Sake). Yeah Rita Repulsa was hammy (Good hammy for me though) and you didn't see the Rangers suit up until the final battle, but that's okay.

Kingsman The Golden Circle (52%)- The first Kingsman was a big surprise for me. I love a lot of Matthew Vaughn's films like Stardust (My favorite one of his), Kick Ass, and X-Men First Class, but I didn't have super high expectations for the first Kingsman. Wow, such an awesome film and it left me wanting a sequel. While many found the sequel disappointing, I thought it was a lot of fun. It's no where near as good as the first film and a certain reveal in the third act felt forced, but I loved it's gleefully silly tone and the chemistry between Eggsy and Harry Hart.

My Little Pony The Movie (48%)- In recent months, I have become a proud brony. The series is really sweet and charming with lovable and strong main characters (Fluttershy being the best), good morals, colorful animation, and surprisingly good songs. Now the movie isn't as good as the show, but still an enjoyable watch IMO. Despite a pretty cliched script and most of the characters besides Twilight Sparkle being a bit underused IMO, I did like the worldbuilding they did, the new songs, the villains, and most importantly, that they retained the charm of The Mane 6.

The Greatest Showman (55%)- I usually don't get super excited for new original musicals, but the trailers for Greatest Showman really impressed me and I found the movie to be a wonderful watch. Hugh Jackman is charming as always and the musical setpieces in this film are so friggen good. Sure the movie does have some script issues and takes a lot of liberties with P.T. Barnum, but that doesn't change the fact that this was a wonderful experience for me.

Bright (25%)- This film has many script problems and I get why a lot of people hated it, but I still thought Bright was a lot of fun and better than David Ayer's previous film Suicide Squad. I loved the world they created where it's our modern world but with magic and magical creatures there and the chemistry between Will Smith and Joel Edgerton. Very excited for the sequel.

A Wrinkle In Time (42%)- I never read the book it's based on and I thought the trailers looked mediocre and then I heard it wasn't good so I originally slipped it. But I finally saw AWIT on Netflix a few months ago and while it defiantly has story structure and third act issues, I still enjoyed it. I loved the performance of the main kid, the story, and the visuals and creativity shown on screen.

Tomb Raider (51%)- This is now the best video game movie ever made IMO. While the Angelina Jolie Tomb Raider movies were goofy fun, this film takes a more serious approach in telling Laura Croft's origin story and I thought they nailed it. Alicia Vikander was excellent in the role and I thought Walton Goggins was a lot of fun as the villain. Best video game movie so far.

Venom (28%)- Venom is my favorite anti hero of all time and I remember being so excited to see him on screen for the first time in 2007 when Spider-Man 3 came out. I'll admit I don't hate that film, but it has a lot of problems and they really butchered Venom in it. So ever since then, I waited for years to see another cinematic Venom and I finally got my wish last year with a stand alone film starring Tom Hardy (My favorite actor right now) and I really enjoyed it. It's not perfect and has a weak villain in Carlton Drake and several scenes missing, but it was a really fun movie that was very faithful to the 90's Lethal Protector, featured a committed Tom Hardy as both Eddie Brock and the Symbiote, didn't focus on setting up a larger world and proved to the people outside of the comic book circles that Venom can be great and successful on his own without others.

Mowgli (52%)- When this film got dumped on Netflix like Cloverfield Paradox did, many feared for the worst. I gotta say that while it's not as good as the 2016 Disney Jungle Book, it's still a pretty good film IMO. It's clearly a different take on the story and I liked the darker tone. And a lot of the voice casting was great like Christian Bale as Bagheera and Andy Serkis as Baloo.

So those were my picks. What are yours? Comment and let me know and thanks so much for reading. :0)"
3,"Most Anticipated Films Of 2019? I know this has been said about previous years in film, but man 2019 looks like a big years for movies. So many exciting films coming out and here are the films I'm the most excited to see.

Joker- A movie about one of the greatest villains of all time, that's a gritty character study/crime drama set in the 80's, and starring Joaquin Phoenix? Sign me up. I know some people are still upset that it's a stand alone film not connected to the larger DC Universe, but that's one of the reasons why I'm excited. Not every CBM needs to be part of a shared universe. We can also have some amazing one shot movies. And with all the talent involved, I think this will be one of them

Once Upon A Time In Hollywood- It's Quentin Tarantino's next film. Of coarse this is making the list. I love the cast (Dicaprio is back after a 4 year hiatus) and premise and that it's not really a film about the Manson Murders, but instead takes place during them.

Fonzo- I believe this film will be Josh Trank's comeback. After Fant4stic's failure, he's going back to what worked for him with a smaller film. And a movie about Al Capone starring Tom Hardy is a great choice. The story about the final years of his life sounds great and we all know Hardy will deliver another killer performance.

A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood- I'll admit that I never watched Mr Rogers Neighborhood as a kid, but after finding some episodes of the show last year and doing research on the guy, I now see that he was the gold standard for a human being and why he inspired so many people. So making a movie about a man (Not a kid) who's whole view on life is changed after meeting him sounds beautiful and the type of film we need now.

The True History Of The Kelly Gang- I'm a big Justin Kurzel fan. I haven't seen Snowtown Murders yet, but I thought his Macbeth film with Michael Fassbender was emotionally powerful and visually stunning and I'm one of the few people who enjoyed his Assassin's Creed film. Now he's making a film set in the 1870's about a group of thieves. Count me in. 

The Irishman- This has been Scorsese's passion project for years and now it's finally coming to Netflix this year. Yes I know some people think that means it will suck, but it's not like they finished the film and then sold it (Like Paramount did with Cloverfield Paradox). They decided it will be a Netflix movie before the cameras started rolling. And I have full faith that it will be good. It's a crime film directed by Martin Scorsese, written by Steve Zaillian, and stars Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci.

IT Chapter 2- The first IT turned out to be one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever made so of coarse I'm excited for the sequel. Yes I know the adults part of the mini series sucked (Though to be fair, the whole thing kind of did), but I have faith in that the filmmakers will crank out another winner.

Godzilla King Of The Monsters- I thought that the 2014 Godzilla film was solid (Though I agree that the lead was dull and that it needed more Godzilla and Bryan Cranston) and I really enjoyed Kong Skull Island despite it's mostly disappointing characters. But this Godzilla film looks like it could be the spectacle of the year. The trailers have been awesome so far (The first one won Comic Con alongside Glass IMO) and seeing Godzilla go toe to toe with Rodan and King Ghidorah makes me wish this film was coming out sooner (As in tomorrow).

Glass- Speaking of Glass, it's almost here! I love Unbreakable (That and Signs are my 2 favorite M Night films) and really enjoyed Split and the trailers have been fantastic. Seeing Mr Glass and The Beast team up looks exciting as hell and it looks like Bruce Willis actually cares about this movie.

Toy Story 4- I consider the Toy Story trilogy to be the greatest animated films ever made (Yes, I rank them above Lion King), so I can't wait to see the 4th film. I know there's a lot of people who are against it because of how perfect the ending for Toy Story 3 was, but you could've made the same argument about the ending for the first 2 films as well. I have full faith that Pixar will give us something that's at the very least, really good.

Honorable mentions go to Shazam, Zombieland 2, Dark Phoenix, Kingsman The Great Game, Kung Fury The Movie, Us, Detective Pickachu, Lion King, Jumanji 3, Pet Sematary, The Curse of La Llorona, The Lighthouse, LEGO Movie 2, Alita Battle Angel, MIB International, The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot (Yes this movie is real), and Star Wars Episode 9.

I'll also through in a couple of shows I'm excited to see too.

Star Vs The Forces Of Evil Season 4 (Finally)

Stranger Things Season 3 (Obviously)

My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic Season 9 (A very sweet show)

The Mandalorian Season 1 (A hopefully great live action SW show)

Legion Season 3 (Loved season 1, need to catch up on season 2)

Black Mirror Season 5 (One of the strangest shows I've ever seen)

What Happened (For those who don't know, it's a show from the late Jon Schnepp and his fiance talking about movies that could've happened, but never did).

What are the films/shows yo're the most excited to see? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"What's More Important To You? Great Characters Or A Great Plot? This is a question I've heard for years and has always stuck in my head. For me, while I always hope for both, I do think great characters are more important than a great story. You can have a movie or show where the plot isn't super complex, but you still enjoy it because you love the characters (That's the case with 2 of my favorite comedies, Elf and The Hangover). If a movie has bad characters or ones that you don't really care that much about, then it can be hard to really get into the plot.

What do you think? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading."
3,"We Lost Three Legends This Year (Stan Lee, Steve Ditko, And Jon Schnepp). Do You Think We'll See Them In The In Memoriam Oscar Tribute? I hope so. I know some people might be tempted to say no because Lee and Ditko are most well known for their contributions to comics and Schnepp is most well known for working on animated and online shows, but I strongly disagree with that. While characters like Spider-Man, Hulk, X-Men, Iron Man, Black Panther, etc are big comic book icons, they are also big movie icons now and I think the Oscars should pay respect to the guys who created them in the first place by including them in their tribute. And with Schnepp (First time I ever cried about a celebrity's passing actually), he directed the great documentary The Death Of Superman Lives What Happened and his online contributions were movie themed shows with AMC/Collider Movie Talk and Heroes.

3,"The Main Cause Of Toxic Fandom I love movies and the online film fandom. However for the last couple of years this fandom (And others) have been plagued by really toxic a##holes who will insult you and others just because you have a different opinion than them. As someone who really appreciates online fandom, this is very upsetting to me and sometimes a fear that if it continues growing the way it is, online fandom could become deserted. I hate things like the Star Wars Prequels and the Transformers sequels, but I'll never crap on someone who does really like them.

My first tiny exposure to toxic fandom was about 7 years ago after looking up what a ""Brony"" was (Men who are fans of My Little Pony) and seeing some comments saying stuff like ""I can't believe you like this stupid little girls show. What a looser"". That was awful to see. So what if it's a show mainly targeted at a younger audience? If you love it, be loud and proud about it.

But was just a tiny forshadowing. It got even worse when it came to news about Fant4stic. Even before the movie's release there was a ton of hate (I have never seen a film get that much pre hate). If you even suggested the possibility that it may turn out okay, you and your whole family could get insulted. Now yes the movie did turn out to be bad, but that doesn't excuse the behavior of those toxic fans.

And then with films like Batman V Superman, Ghostbusters, Star Wars The Last Jedi, and Solo, it just got worse and worse. With BVS, it doesn't matter if you said you liked it or not. You would get tons of hate comments anyway. With Ghostbusters, it led to people accusing anyone who hated the trailers or movie of being sexist and anyone who liked them of just being afraid to be called sexist (How sad). And then with the recent Star Wars films, it led to no one being able to talk about the franchise without getting filled with comments from trolls (John Campea had to disable comments on his Solo review due to people calling him a shill and some even threatening to hurt his family).

So yeah, it appears that the main cause of toxic fandom is because stupid people just can't handle the fact that people will have different opinions than them and that all film is subjective. How sad is that? We need these fandoms to clean up. We more guys like the late great Jon Schnepp and the awesome Siike Donnelly (The Venom Vlog) in our favorite fandoms and less people like ComicBookCast2's Armin and Geeks And Gamers.

I just want all fandoms to be truly great again. Stop the stupid boycotts and dumb insults and start having fun. No fandom is 100% and we'll always have a few incidents of toxic fandom, but I want things to go back to the way they were. Where everyone was able to get along and have fun talking about and debating movies and shows. My favorite online fandom right now is the Star Vs The Forces Of Evil fandom because you very rarely see toxicity there. It's mostly filled with good and genuine fans.

What do you think? Do you think this is the main cause of toxic fandom or is it something else? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading."
3,"Thoughts On The Idea Of Sequels To Movies In Comic Book Form? Sometimes we have movies that we really love and would want to see sequels for, but aren't likely due to the first film flopping at the box office. So what if instead of investing millions of dollars and making a sequel movie, you spend significantly less and make the sequel as a comic book. Maybe that's how we can get sequels to films like The Nice Guys, Power Rangers, Fury Road, Assassin's Creed, Owls Of Ga'Hoole, Dredd, Edge Of Tomorrow, etc.

What do you think? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Actors You Really Like, But Have Been Typecast? Here are my 2 biggest picks right now.

Jackie Earle Haley- I'm a huge fan of this guy and consider him one of the most underrated actors in the business, but he has become very synonymous with playing some kind of creep (And he always does an awesome job) in films/shows like Little Children (Which he got an Oscar nomination for), Watchmen, the 2010 Nightmare On Elm Street, The Tick, etc. You sometimes get to see him playing someone other than a creep in stuff like Lincoln, but most of the time now he plays the creepy role (And always delivers).

Eden Sher- I became a big fan of Eden's thanks to her voice role on Disney's Star Vs The Forces Of Evil (My favorite show on TV right now actually). She's always adorable and charming on screen in projects like Star Vs, The Middle, and even in terrible movies like Outcasts and Step Sisters. Even though I would like to see her try some more dramatic work (I think she could have some chops to do it), I will always be entertained by her.

What would your picks be? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Excitement Level For Next Year's Fonzo? It's one of my anticipated films of 2019. I think a movie about the final year's of Al Capone's life and him suffering from dementia could make for a really great and dark gangster drama. Plus you've got an excellent cast lead by Tom Hardy (And the early photos of him as Capone look amazing). Weather he's playing the Kray Twins, Mad Max, Charles Bronson, Bane, Venom, or anyone else, Hardy always gives his full effort. 

I also believe that this could be a potential comeback for Josh Trank like how The Visit and Split were a comeback for M Night Shyamalan and how Hacksaw Ridge was one for Mel Gibson. I loved his direction on Chronicle (The best found footage film ever made IMO). Yes we all know Fant4stic turned out to be a stinker and had tons of production problems, but I don't put all the blame on Trank (It's known the studio also meddled a lot before and after production). Plus like M Night, maybe going back to smaller films is the right thing for him to do.

What do you think? How excited are you for Fonzo? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"What Did You Guys Think Of Mom And Dad? I just saw it on Hulu last week and I absolutely loved it for all of it's craziness (Even though the ending is very abrupt and some of the girl's friends aren't so good in the film). Tons of crazy kills, Nic Cage (Hokey Pokey) at his best and most insane , and a really good performance from Selma Blair made this film awesome to watch. Brian Taylor directed this film (He also worked with Nic Cage on Ghost Rider 2 which has become a guilty pleasure for me) and while this type of direction wouldn't work in a lot of other films, it works perfectly here.

What did you think of the film? Love it or hate it? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Thoughts On Sony's Ghost Rider Movies? I remember being excited for the 2007 film because of the concept. I have't read any of the Ghost Rider comics, but the idea  a guy played by Nicolas Cage making a deal with the devil and turning into a cursed flaming monster with a flaming motorcycle because of it sounded pretty cool. And it ended up being pretty bad IMO. It was filled with hammy dialogue, wasted characters with Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda's roles, a terrible performance from Wes Bentley and some not so great FX (Although the first transformation scene was cool and Christopher Young's score was pretty good). Though I'll admit I only saw it once years ago and I know it does have it's fans. Maybe I should give it another shot.

And then we got a stand alone sequel in 2012 with Ghost Rider Spirit Of Vengeance (And they added Idris Elba to the cast and kind of wasted him). And it also stunk. I will say that I liked it a bit more than the first one. You got some more crazy Nic Cage moments, it was shot well, some of the action was really cool (Although some of it was also lame) and the effects look better. But it was still a mess. I know it was originally supposed to be a reboot, but they changed that when Nic Cage agreed to come back.

So yeah I consider both of Sony's Ghost Rider films missed opportunities. They could've been awesome R Rated action/supernatural films, but instead we got these watered down films with cheesy dialogue.

What do you think of the films? Love them? Hate them? In the middle? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"About 20th Century Fox I've been saying this since November and I still believe it. I think this impending Disney/Fox merger is terrible. Now before I say why, I want to say that I'm a fan of Disney. Sometimes I get accused of hating Disney properties, but I am a fan of them. I like certain MCU films (Iron Man, Thor, Black Panther, Winter Solider, Hulk, Ant-Man, Avengers, Guardians), what they've done with the Star Wars movies so far (Including Last Jedi and Solo), old and new Disney animation films, Pixar, and some of their recent cartoons (Star Vs The Forces Of Evil is actually my favorite show airing right now and season 4 needs to get here faster).

That being said, I don't want them acquiring Fox's properties or Fox stepping away from the film industry. That company has been one of the major film studios for a LONG time and they haven't been financially struggling. Yes I know Murdoch wants Fox to focus more on news and sports, but you can do that and still keep the film division.

Fox has also given us a lot of great films over the years. So far this decade they've given us great blockbuster hits like X-Men First Class, X-Men Days Of Future Past, Deadpool 1 and 2, Life Of Pi, Logan, The Planet Of The Apes Trilogy, Kingsman The Secret Service, The Martian, The Revenant, Gone Girl, etc and great smaller films like Shape Of Water, Three Billboards, Hidden Figures, Birdman, 12 Years A Slave, Chronicle, 127 Hours, etc (And I even enjoyed X-Men Apocalypse, Prometheus, Alen Covenant, Assassin's Creed, Greatest Showman, Kingsman 2, and The Wolverine even if not everyone else did). Yes they've also given us some big crappers/letdowns like Fant4stic, Hitman Agent 47, ID Resurgence, Exodus Gods And Kings, etc, but every studio does (Disney also gave us Lone Ranger, Prince Of Persia, and Planes). Plus with Fox leaving the film industry and selling it's assets, we as film fans will get less films every year now.

So yeah. Since this deal is 99.9% likely to go through, I'm gonna miss Fox (And their drum intro. Best studio intro ever) a lot. What do you think? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Biggest Movie Disappointments Of The Decade In Your Opinion? There are tons of films that come out every year that totally suck and are horrible trainwrecks, but most of those were never expected to be any good. The bad films that really hurt are the ones we could see potential in, but unfortunately didn't deliver. 

The Last Airbender- I didn't start watching the animated series until after the film's release and after watching season 1 I hate this film even more than I did on first viewing. Not only is this a very rushed adaptation of the first season, it also contains cringe worthy dialogue, unfinished CGI, terrible pacing, and some of the worst acting I've ever seen. Such a shame. It could've been the start to a great franchise. Hopefully they reboot it one day.

The Snowman- I think Michael Fassbender's recent ""Bad movie streak"" has been overexaggerated. I really enjoyed X-Men Apocalypse, I consider Assassin's Creed a great video game movie, I liked Alien Covenant, and  I thought Light Between Oceans was decent (Though it could've been better). But The Snowman is a boring horribly edited mess that even one of my favorite actors couldn't save. I love a good murder mystery (Se7en is one of my favorite films), so why would you reveal the killer in the opening scene?!

Fant4stic- I remember proclaiming this would be the best CBM of 2015 and one of the best CBM ever made and I felt like I had good reasons to think that. After all you had the director of Chronicle, the writer of X-Men DOFP, Matthew Vaughn producing the film, a great cast, fantastic trailers, an interesting tone, and a studio coming off of great blockbusters like X-Men DOFP, Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes, and Kingsman. I actually thought the first half of the film was decent and showed there was a great film made, but due to extensive reshoots and extreme behind the scenes problems, the second act got sloppy and the third act was horrible.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2- I drank the Kool Aid on this film. I was so excited for it because Spidey has always been my hero and Marc Webb did a great job on 500 Days Of Summer and the first ASM. And when I initially saw it, I loved it, called it the best Spidey film, and defended it online. But after rewatching it and thinking about it more, I saw more of the film's tonal problems and how Sony meddled wit the film to set up a larger world. I learned a valuable lesson to not trick myself into loving a movie just because I wanted to

The Dark Tower- I didn't hate this movie, but I still consider it a big missed opportunity. I've never read the books, but I loved the world that was set up and the characters of The Gunslinger and The Man In Black and all the performances. The problem is that the film felt very rushed and an hour of footage was cut out causing you to not learn a lot about the world. At least IT gave us a great Stephen King adaptation and hopefully the DT Amazon show is better.

Warcraft- I thought this would end up being the first beloved video game movie since it had a rich world to work with and was being directed by Duncan Jones (Who made the incredible film Moon). And it ended up just being okay IMO. I didn't think it was awful like a lot of others did, but I had problems with the film's pacing (Which is likely to due with 45 minutes being cut) and human characters (The orcs were great though).

Justice League- I consider myself somewhat of a DCEU fan. I love Man Of Steel and consider it the second best CBM ever made right behind X-Men Days Of Future Past, I really like the Ultimate Cut of Batman V Superman (Not so much the theatrical cut), and Wonder Woman was quite good (Was disappointed with Suicide Squad though). So obviously I was excited to see the first live action Justice League film and when I first saw it I enjoyed it. I thought it was good harmless fun. But after rewatching some of it and thinking more about it, I realized it's a Frankenstein's monster mess. I would love to see Zack Snyder's original cut.

Jonah Hex- This film has so much potential. An R rated gritty revenge thriller western starring Josh Brolin, John Malkovich, and Michael Fassbender. Unfortunately though the studio trimmed the film, fired the directors and replaced them at the last minute, and reedited all the action scenes to get a PG-13 rating. Awful chopped up mess.

Exodus Gods And Kings- Ridley Scott making a biblical epic about Mosus starring Christian Bale? Yeah that sounds amazing. The movie starts of really well and engaged me for the first 20 minutes (And it's visually stunning). But after that it becomes an incredibly boring lifeless mess until the Parting Of The Red Sea and ending.

What would be your picks? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Are People Exaggerating Michael Fassbender's Bad Movie Streak? I've noticed a lot of film fans have been saying that Fassbender has been in garbage ever since 2016. The films that are often brought up are X-Men Apocalypse, The Light Between Oceans, Assassin's Creed, Alien Covenant, and The Snowman.

With Apocalypse, I don't get the extreme hate it got. Sure the film has some problems, but it's not the worst X-Men film (That honor still goes to Wolverine Origins IMO). And it also has one of the best acted scenes in a superhero film where Magneto's daughter dies in the forest. Fassbender has always been great as Magneto, but that scene was his best as the character.

I didn't love Light Between Oceans, but I also didn't think it was terrible. I was really into the film until Fassbender's character reveals the truth to the baby's real mother for no reason. The rest of the film isn't bad, but it it lost steam for me because of that huge plothole. But still, because it was beautifully shot and very well acted/directed, I can't call it awful (Plus I don't think the RT score for it is that bad actually).

I just bought the Blu Ray of Assassin's Creed and I still stand by my claim that it's the best video game film ever made. I know not everyone feels that way and that's cool, but I think this film gets way too much hate. I remember Dennis Tzeng from Collider actually compared it to The Last Airbender, which I found to be a ridiculous comparison. Unlike a lot of garbage adaptations like House Of The Dead, Silent Hill Revelation, and Mortal Komabt Annihilation, they put real effort into AC in terms of directing, acting, production value, cinematography, and score. And for me it paid off. It was also Fassbender's first time producing a film and I'm excited to see his creative contributions to Kung Fury.

It's weird with Alien Covenant because the reviews were actually good, but I've noticed it's been very divisive with the Alien fanbase. As someone who loved Prometheus I wanted a proper sequel to that with Shaw and David, but I still enjoyed what I got in Covenant. And I loved seeing David and Walter on screen together.

I will agree that The Snowman was awful though. I was so excited for that film and I saw it after hearing all about the bad reviews thinking ""It can't be that bad"". Wow, everyone was on the money. A murder mystery film that reveals the killer in the first 5 minutes of the movie with horrible editing and missing scenes (According to the director, 15% of the script wasn't filmed). 

So yeah other than The Snowman (Which I think is Fassbender's worst film along with Jonah Hex), I don't think his recent films have been that bad. And other than Assassin's Creed which he was a producer on, he had nothing to do with the creative parts of these films. He was just the actor.

What do you think? Agree or disagree? Comment and let me know and thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"About Toxic Fandom Pretty much all fanbases have a few toxic fans, but over the last couple of years I've noticed it's really been growing and growing to the point where I could see it really tarnishing almost all online fandoms.

I really started to notice this in 2016 when Batman V Superman and Captain America Civil War were released. Many fans were either upset or happy that BVS wasn't well received and that CW was and regardless of which movie you say you liked more, you would get trashed. And if you said something like ""I loved BVS and totally hated CW"" (Or vice verse), you would get trashed so much that you could potentially get death threats. And of course there was that ridiculous theory that Marvel was paying off critics to hate BVS and DC in general.

I also noticed this when Ghostbusters came out that same year. Like a lot of people, I didn't really like the film, but I'm cool if someone says they did like it and found it funny and I won't insult them for it. You had a lot of people who were either making fun of fans/critics who enjoyed, accusing them of being a Sony shill, or trying to make excuses like ""They're just afraid of being called sexist and that's why they're saying they liked it"". Wow, how pathetic is that.

And of course there's the whole Last Jedi controversy. A lot of people are just good fans who didn't like the movie and that's totally fine. But there's also a good chunk of people who will mock anyone who likes the film, accuse them of being a Disney shill, and lash out horrible racist/sexist comments. The controversy was also involved with Solo. I remember John Campea had to disable the comments on his review of the film because of all the hateful and nasty comments.

Toxic fans will also get involved in groups who will start a mission to get certain films to fail. I've seen this recently with films like Solo, Venom, Aquaman, Bumblebee, Dark Phoenix, etc. Why would you want a movie to suck and fail? Shouldn't we as film fans just want it to be a good film?

My fear now is that if this continues to grow, it could lead to these online fandoms getting destroyed. That it will turn off potential new fans and get already existing fans to leave. Why can't all of us just accept other people's opinions and have fun expressing our thoughts on the things we love and are passionate about? I hate the Star Wars prequels, the Transformers sequels, the Northwest Mansion episode of Gravity Falls, the Tim Story Fantastic 4 films, etc. But I will never insult people who do love those films. I'm happy they do. Sure we can have fun debates about them, but I would never insult someone liking something I hate.

3,"December 2016 Gave Us 3 Big Sci Fi films With Rogue One, Passengers, And Assassin's Creed. How Would You Rank Them From Best To Worst? My personal ranking.

Assassin' Creed- On initial viewing, I thought this film was just okay. Not great, but not as bad as most people say. But it never left my head and really grew on me. I then rewatched it a few months ago and I can now say I really really like AC despite some issues. Micheal Fassbender's gives a great duel performance, Kurzel's style fit the film very well, they set up a very interesting and complex world, and it had fantastic production value, sets, and a killer score. Very disappointed it flopped.

Passengers- Saw this on Starz a few months ago expecting it to be poor and was pleasantly surprised. I actually really enjoyed the film up until the forced happy ending. Love these type of ""stranded/survival"" stories.

Rogue One- Saw it opening day and was very satisfied with it. But after rewatching it on Netflix a few months ago, I liked it a little less. My biggest flaw with the film is it's lack of character development (Especially with Jyn). Still like the film overall, but not great.

What would your ranking be? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"I Don't Understand The ""We Didn't Ask For This Movie"" Argument Ever since I joined the online film fandom a few years ago, something that I would often see is some people saying ""We didn't ask for this movie"" when news on some big blockbusters came out.  

I don't really get this. Last year we had great films like Shape Of Water, Three Billboards, Get Out, and Dunkirk. Did anyone really ask for those film? No. But I think most of us are happy people made them. Tons of great films come out every year that no one asked for. And with big blockbusters and projects in the comic book/sci fi world, no one was really asking for a Guardians Of The Galaxy movie or a Legion TV show before they were made. And yet those projects ended up being awesome.

3,"What Jon Schnepp Meant To Me Yesterday we heard the very heartbreaking news that director/writer/panelist Jon Schnepp had passed away from a stroke. This news really affected me because for the last 5 years I had been following him and most of the other AMC/Collider crew. I've always had anxiety in my life (And still do), but back in 2013 it was pretty rough. But one day I discovered a news show on Youtube called AMC Movie Talk and that is what caused me to become a big movie fan. Schnepp, Campea, and the rest of the crew made me realize how impactful movies can be and how fun it is to talk about them, and that really helped me get through that difficult time of my life. 

I always found Schnepp to be hilarious (There was one time he actually made me cry laughing during his response to the Aunt May movie rumor), intelligent, and very passionate when it comes to movies and comics. He was a true ""Sweaty Nerd"" and I always enjoyed listening to his POV on things whether I agreed with it or not. He's also done great work in the world of animation with stuff like Metalocalypse and even the Black Panther animated series (And of course he made the great documentary The Death Of Superman Lives What Happened). And even though I never got a chance to actually meet him, I've heard from everyone who knew him and met him that was one of the nicest guys in the business. 

I will miss you Jon Schnepp. I honestly don't think I've ever been this heartbroken by a celebrity passing. Thank you for helping me discover my passion, helping me get through a rough time, and just being a fun entertaining guy. My condolences go to your fiance, family, and friends from AMC/Collider."
3,"Any Update On Justin Kurzel's Next Film? It appears he has several films in the works. Originally he was going to film a movie called The Siege last year, but he's also attached to direct a World War 2 thriller with Gal Gadot called Ruin and another film called The True History Of The Kelly Gang with Russel Crowe and and Nicholas Holt. 

I consider this guy a very underrated director. I haven't seen Snowtown Murders yet (Even though I've heard great things about it), but I thought the direction and style he brought to 2015's Macbeth was very strong. The movie wasn't perfect, but his direction was excellent IMO. I also think he made the best video game movie of all time with Assassin's Creed and his short film Blue Tongue is pretty interesting too.

What do you think of Kurzel's work and have you heard any recent updates on his next project? Comment and let me know. Thanks."
3,"Most Anticipated Films For The Rest Of The Year? With big blockbusters like Infinity War and Deadpool 2 and smaller films like Upgrade and A Quiet Place now released, I'm curious what are the films that are coming out throughout the rest of the year.  

Here are my personal picks.

1. Venom- Out of all the anti heroes, Venom has always been my personal favorite (And my second favorite comic book character behind Spider-Man). Yeah they screwed him up in 2007, but I think redemption is coming. Loving the trailers and the tone so far and I trust Tom Hardy's judgement. #WeAreVenom

2. First Man- Has potential to be one of the best films of the year considering who's directing it. Plus you have one of the best actors today playing Neil Armstrong.

3. Aquaman- I know Aquaman used to be viewed as a joke, but things like New 52 and Injustice showed he can be a badass. And I have full faith that someone like James Wan can give us that version of the character in his first solo film.

4. Christopher Robin- I grew up with the Winnie The Pooh cartoon (Tigger was always my favorite) and I'm a big fan of Ewan Mcgregor. Looks like Hook but with the Pooh gang (Which is a great thing).

5. Wreck It Ralph 2- The first film was one of Disney's best in recent years so of course I want to see this (Surprised it took this long). 

6. Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse- Looks visually spectacular (No pun intended) and with Lord/Miller and Alex Hirsch involved, I'm expecting great things. Just hope Peter's voice is better in the actual film.

7. Mission Impossible Fallout- Looks like the perfect example of a fun thrilling time at the movies. Can't wait to see what crazy stunts Tom Cruise has planned this time.

I would've put the Al Capone film Fonzo on this list too, but that's apparently been delayed to 2019 now.

3,"Why Do People Pay Attention To Movie ""Leaks"" From 4chan Or Reddit? Most of the time they're fake (You might be able to point out a couple of times they were right, but those are the exceptions. 99.9% of the time, they're bull.""). Anyone can go on those sites and claim whatever they want. I can go on those sites and say I saw a rough cut of First Man and some people would (sadly) probably believe me. 

Like I said, most of the time these leaks are fake. A year before Batman V Superman came out, there was a ""leak"" that claimed that it would be a 2 part film. Turns out it was fake. Then there were several big ""leaks"" breaking down the plot of The Force Awakens came out. Turns out it was fake. And then there was that rumor we would only get 5 minutes of Venom in the upcoming solo film. Turns out it was fake.

There's now some people taking about these possible plot leaks for upcoming big films like Avengers 4, Spider-Man 2, Star Wars Episode 9, X-Men Dark Phoenix, etc when they're probably bull. Please stop. These aren't good sources.

What do you think of this? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Movie Sequels You Really Want That Will Probably Never Happen? I have 2 big picks.

1. Legend Of The Guardians The Owls Of Ga'Hoole- Whenever film fans talk about Zack Snyder films, this movie is never brought up. That's a real shame since it's one of his best films IMO (And one of the most underrated animated films). A wonderful hero's journey tale with owls as the leads. The film does set up a sequel with Kludd surviving his fall and looking at the Metal Beak mask. But due to disappointing box office returns and Snyder's involvement with other projects, the continuation never happened. Such a shame.

2. Assassin's Creed- The best video game movie so far IMO (Despite some script issues). Justin Kurzel managed to bring his beautiful style from Macbeth to this world with Assassins and Templars and got a great lead performance out of Michael Fassbender. The film ends with Cal now part of a new group of Assassins and Sofia vowing revenge on him for her father's death (There's also a hint she may be related to him).

What would your choices be? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading."
3,"Why Is Everyone Against The Upcoming Crow Remake? I just watched the original Alex Proyas Crow film a couple of days ago and absolutely loved it like everyone else. But I've noticed people have been against this planned remake for a long while. And while I've been annoyed by the constant production setbacks, I want the film to happen because I believe it's a great story that could benefit from a modern day remake. I also like the casting of Jason Mamoa in the role of Eric Draven quite a bit. 

Currently the film is scheduled to come out next October with filming starting this July. I really hope it happens this time as it could bring more attention back to The Crow. And if it sucks, don't worry we still have the original film.

3,"Thoughts On The Upcoming Kung Fury Film? I didn't see the short film until earlier this year and I gotta say it's a cheesefest of awesomeness. So I'm pretty excited for the movie. I hear it's gonna have the same tone as the short (Very corny and self aware) and be a sequel to it. Plus the fact that this is a real film assembling Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Fassbender, and David Hasselhoff together is worth the price of a ticket to me.

Yes, this movie could totally suck and be stretched out for to long. But I also think there is a chance for something really special with Kung Fury."
3,"Anyone Else Getting A Little Tied Of Cinematic Universes Kind of funny that I'm asking this considering just a couple of years ago, I was all into the idea of hugely interconnected cinematic universes. But starting mid to late last year, I wasn't thinking about them as much as I used to. This is probably because some of Marvel's more recent films haven't done it for me, DC having issues running their universe, and several other ones falling apart after the first planned film (Ghostbusters, King Arthur, The Mummy, Amazing Spider-Man 2, etc). 

I'm not saying that I'm against cinematic universes or that there can't be great films from them (Looking forward to Godzilla Vs Kong in 2020). But I think the extremely connected shared universe concept has hurt some franchises because the director won't have as much creative control compared to other films and because so many cooks can get in the kitchen and want the film to be 17 different things.

Look at something like the X-Men franchise. Yes it's a big comic book series with spin offs, but they aren't really that concerned with continuity and because of that we are able to get very different film like Deadpool, Logan, and X-Men DOFP (Those wouldn't fit together if they were concerned with continuity). I think some other franchises like the DCEU, Sony's Marvel/Venom Universe, and a possible reboot of Universal Monsters should take this path were they can have a big long franchise, but not have to worry about how every film ties to each other or how one film sets up a totally separate spin off.

But this is just my opinion. What do you think? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Is A 4K Television Worth It? Ever since they started coming out in 2016, I've been curious about watching movies on a 4K TV. The problem is that they are incredibly expensive so I might have to wait awhile before trying it out. But do you guys think it's worth it or is a normal Blu Ray player just fine? And if you think it is worth it and what films do you think look the best on 4K UHD? I have some guesses.

3,"Movie News Sites Will Apprently Report On Anything (Little Rant) You probably saw this week headlines about the upcoming Venom movie like ""'Venom' Movie Rumored to Not Have Much Venom in It, Actually"". Here's the thing though. All these reports/posts are really talking about someone making a post on 4chan claiming that he saw an early rough cut of Sony's upcoming film back in December (Which would be impossible since the film was still shooting back then) and listed the main beats of the story and said that you only get a few minutes of Venom action during the final battle. 

Most people will probably agree that leak posts on 4chan and Reddit shouldn't be taken seriously as anyone can go on those sites and post whatever they want. I could go on there and claim that Gilbert Godfried will be in both Avengers Infinity War and First Man and some people would probably believe me (Sad). But no. Some established sites like Manta Byte (Run by Jeremy Conrad), Movie Web, Inverse, ComicBookMovie, Dark Horizons, etc starting reporting this as the next big rumor (And most of them didn't mention that the leak came from 4chan). Thankfully sites like Variety and Hollywood Reporter didn't report it as news, but it does upset me that other big sites would be willing to do something like that. It would be different if the rumor came from somewhere like Deadline or The Wrap, but no it came from a 4chan post and that's supposed to be newsworthy now apparently.

3,"If Spider-Man 3 Turned Out Better Than It Did, Could The Raimi Spider-Man Trilogy Be Mentioned With The Best Trilogies? I think the answer is yes. The first Spider-Man film was a great origin movie and proved that superhero movies could still work (Along with the first X-Men film). Spider-Man 2 is one of the best CBM ever made with fantastic storytelling about how having 2 different lives would affect someone. And then Spider-Man 3 was a big letdown. It isn't a total trainwreck and it has some great stuff in it, but it also has a lot of bad stuff too.

I'm not saying that the trilogy would be considered better than good as Star Wars, Godfather, Toy Story, or Lord Of The Rings if Spidey 3 was great, but I do think you would hear the series mentioned in those conversations about great trilogies more.

3,"Why Do Some People Actually Want Certain Movies To Suck? To me that makes no sense at all. I get having certain expectations for a film and thinking it will be great or terrible because that's just natural. But why would you actually hope that a film is bad?

I started to notice this back in 2013 or 2014 whenever a piece of news came out about Marvel franchises not owned by Marvel Studios (X-Men, Fantastic Four, Spider-Man). I would often see a lot of comments that said that they hope the movies suck and tank so the rights can go back to Marvel so it could be good. But if you're hoping to get a good X-Men or Spider-Man film, why don't you just hope the next film in the franchise is good?

I've also noticed some people trying to boycott upcoming blockbuster films like Solo, Venom, Aquaman, etc and hope they suck and fail even if they're good movies? How does that make any sense? If Solo and Venom are really good movies, why would you want them to fail? Just to prove a point? 

So that's my little rant. What do you think of this? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Ranking The Big Movie Trailers This Week This was a huge week for trailers (Mostly thanks to the Super Bowl), but how would you rank them from best to worst? Here's my personal ranking.

1. Deadpool 2- That whole Toy Story parody killed me. The marketing team behind Deadpool are geniuses. We also get to see Josh Brolin looking like a seriously badass Cable. And that big jab at Justice League was also brilliant.

2. Mission Impossible Fallout- I'm not the biggest MI fan, but this trailer looks like a lot of fun. Tom Cruise is a great actor and very dedicated when it comes to doing crazy stunts. It's also great to see Henry Cavill is in this film (Hopefully that mustache was worth it).

3. Venom- I know a lot of people are mixed on this teaser, but I quite liked it as a first teaser. The trailer does a good job at showing us the dark/serious horror/action tone and how damaged Eddie Brock is (It looks like his wife left him and he's ill with something). Yes I know we didn't actually get to see Venom in this trailer (Although you do get some shots of the Symbiote), but that's fine considering it's just a teaser for a movie that's still 8 months away and has a lot of post production work to do.

4. Solo- This is probably the trailer most of us have been waiting for. And I think it's a pretty good first trailer. I'm liking what I see of Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo (No one will replace Harrison Ford though) and the visuals look great. I still have some big concerns about this film because of all the behind the scenes drama, but this trailer did it's job and made me more excited.

5. Skyscraper- Looks like an ""eh"" Die Hard rip off starring The Rock. I love Dwayne Johnson (And I do like the idea of having the action hero having a missing leg), but this just looks very mediocre. And that final jump at the end looks pretty stupid and impossible. 

6. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom- Eh. While it's better than the first trailer, I'm still not feeling the excitement this trailer wants me to feel. And while I had fun watching Jurassic World, it wasn't the great film Jurassic Park was and I was hoping that the sequel would focus a little more on the characters. But after this trailer, I wouldn't get my hopes up.

How would you rank these trailers from best to worst? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Cloverfield Vs 10 Cloverfield Lane? I know I may be in the minority on this opinion, but I'm going with 10 Cloverfield Lane. I watched that film last year on Amazon Prime and thought it was a really well directed thriller (First time director as well) with excellent acting (Especially from John Goodman) and a shocking ending that I didn't see coming.

I recently watched the original Cloverfield on IFC and was disappointed. I didn't hate it (The monster worked), but it wasn't the great film I heard about. The characters were weak, most of the attempts at humor fell flat, the first 10 minutes of the film feel very slow, and while some of the found footage works IMO (The Blair Witch Project and Chronicle and even Project Almanac come to mind), there are several other times where I felt like they could've filmed it like a real movie. I love Matt Reeves as a director and what he's done with the Planet Of The Apes films (And I can't wait for his take on Batman), but I could defiantly see now that he's improved.

Which Cloverfield film do you like more? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"What Cancelled Sequels Do You Wish Happened? Here are my personal choices.

Legend Of The Guardians The Owls Of Ga'Hoole 2- I consider this Zack Snyder's most underrated film (Even a lot of his biggest fans seem to forget about this film) and one of the most underrated films in the last few years. Snyder was able to tell an adventurous heroes journey story with owls and have it be awesome for all ages (And pretty dark for a kids film). And as someone who read the first 6 books in the series, I consider this film an improvement on them. Sadly, even thought the film sets up a sequel, it doesn't look like it will ever happen. It's been almost 8 years since the film came out, Snyder has worked on the DCEU films and will be directing a war film soon, and while I loved it, the critical reception was mixed overall and it wasn't a huge box office success. 

Assassin's Creed 2- Yeah, most video game movies suck, but Justin Kurzel's adaptation of Assassin's Creed is one I actually consider good (So far, it's the best video game film ever made IMO). Sure it has it's issues like the past storyline not having enough screentime, some characters being underdeveloped, and a little too much exposition dialogue. But because of the interesting world and concepts that were set up, a great performance from Michael Fassbender, a compelling relationship between Aguilar and Maria, the action, the cinematography, and Jed Kurzel's amazing score (My favorite track is Young Cal), I really enjoyed it (And the film's novelization is really good too and actually fixes a few of the problems and adds to the film). But even though I liked the film, I know I'm in the minority. Most critics ripped the film to shreds in it really underperformed at the box office. Granted, neither Ubisoft of Fox have come out and said the sequel or planned trilogy are cancelled, but given the film's reception and box office, it's most likely dead. Maybe they can continue the story as a comic though.

Chronicle 2- I don't like most found footage film (There are some exception like the first Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield), but generally speaking I'm not a fan of the style. But I would say my favorite found footage film is probably Chronicle. It's a brilliant supervillain origin story and the found footage style actually works. And the film does set itself up for a sequel. I know Max Landis wrote a script for one that continues the story, but Fox rejected it and just wanted a rehash of the first film. And eventually Landis and Josh Trank were no longer attached to the project and we haven't heard anything since. And given how Fox has burned bridges with Trank (And possibly Landis), I think the sequel is probably dead. And that breaks my heart.

Part of me wants to say Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 4 because I love the first 2 films and it would've been great to see Raimi and crew make up for the third film (Which I didn't hate), but some of the script rumors I've read sound not so great (Peter killing Vulture and MJ leaving him, a love triangle between Peter, MJ, and Felicia Hardy, Vultress, etc).

What would be your picks? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"An Idea For The Next Nightmare On Elm Street Reboot I know most people are against the idea of another Elm Street film because of how the 2010 reboot turned out. Now I'll admit I didn't hate that film. Overall, it's a weak film, but I did like that they tries going for a more darker tone, the score was great, I liked the idea of micro naps being part of the story, and Jackie Earle Haley did a good job as the new Freddy. 

One of the other things the 2010 reboot did was the fact that they originally try to make us ask the question ""Did Freddy actually abuse the kids or was he innocent this whole time?"" I thought that was a cool new take on the story, but unfortunately they kind of ruin that later when it's revealed that he did abuse them. So my proposal for a new Elm Street film is this.

Have Freddy actually be an innocent man.

Think about it this way. In both the original film and the remake, they burn Freddy alive as revenge for what he did and he fully deserved it. But what if Freddy was a truly nice guy who was framed and even though the parents burn him trying to protect their children, they end up creating the monster/legend we now know as Freddy Kruger and make things worse for their kids.

3,"What Movie Scenes/Moments Do You Consider Truly Perfect Or Flawless? I got the idea to make this post after watching a video from a movie/anime reviewer named Tony (AKA The Black Critic Guy) where he described why he thought the Star Vs The Forces Of Evil episode Lava Lake Beach was amazing and how it had a perfect ending. In the video, he also showed he considers films like Whiplash, Unforgivin, Up, and A Few Good Men to have perfect scenes. And that got me thinking ""What scenes do I consider perfect/flawless?"" 

So I decided to make my own list of scenes from movies that I think are masterfully done. Keep in mind that this list is just my opinion and I'm just listing the movies that immediately come to mind. Maybe I'm missing a few other picks.

And of course, spoiler warning.

The Shawshank Redemption- It's hard to pick just one scene from Shawshank since the whole film is flawless (My favorite film of all time), but if I to just pick one part of the film it would probably be the ending where Red violates parole and travels across the border to finally reunite with Andy. The entire film masterfully develops Andy and Red as best friends and so seeing them finally reunite on that beautiful beach after all this time moved me in a way that no other film has ever done. Add in the gorgous cinematography from Roger Dekins and Thomaas Newmann's amazing score, you have the most emotionally satisfying ending of all time IMO. I know that originally Frank Darabont wanted to end the film and not show Red cross the border since hope is the main theme of the film. And while that would've been a very powerful ending too, I'm glad we got to see the 2 reunite and be happy (And Darabont also knew that the scene shouldn't go on too long at the risk of getting overly sappy).

Whiplash- I honestly think this film should've won Best Picture over Birdman (Which I also love). This film is pretty flawless in every way (Acting, character development, directing, story, editing, score, etc). And my god this film's climax with Andrew performing the drums live to impress Mr Fletcher is one of the most intense scenes I've ever seen. Just as intense as a great action scene.

Goodfellas- This might sound like a bit of a cliche, but it's the whole ""You think I'm funny"" moment where Joe Pesci asks the guy who said he was funny what that really means. Tommy Devito is a very darkly funny guy throughout the entire film, but this scene also tells us to not say the wrong thing to him. And I'm shocked by how great and tight this scene feels considering it was improvised, not scripted.

Gladiator- I just saw this film for the first time a few months ago and absolutely loved it (Are You Not Entertained?!). But even though I already knew what the ending was, I still found it to be emotionally moving. Maximus's death was handled beautifully and Juba promising to Maximus again one day=the man feels.

American Psycho- Sometimes narration in films can feel forced and/or lazy and come across as the director and writers giving us a big exposition dump. But some films like the aforementioned  Shawshank Redemption and American Psycho use narration perfectly. Considering how insane and weird Patrick Bateman is, it makes total sense for us to hear what he's saying in his head. And that opening scene of him getting up and showering while giving us his monologue. Dark comedy gold. Now, if you excuse me I have to return some Hughy Lewis In The News videotapes.

Seven- What's in the box!? Seven has one of the greatest climax's I've ever seen. When the detectives finally catch the killer John Doe, he helps them find the final 2 victims. It turns out that one of them was Brad Pitt's wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) and her head is now decapitated in a box. This angers Pitt so much that despite Morgan Freeman's warning, shoots Doe in the head and he becomes the last victim (Wraith). Pitt is then arrested for the murder. The reason this ending floured me so much isn't just because of how intense it is, it's because we have a movie where the bad guy actually won. Sure he gets killed, but that was all part of his plan. Thank god New Line Cinema didn't change this ending.

Jaws- Obviously you have to talk about the opening scene of Jaws where the shark first attacks that drunk woman. Even though you don't see the shark (Mainly because they where having problems with the prop), that's great because the things you don't see terrify you more than the tings you do see. And of course John Williams's score is still a classic on it's own. Makes you scared of swimming at a beach. Also, the entire scene where Quint tells Brody and Hooper about the whole U.S.S Indianapolis incident after they were just drinking and having fun. I honestly hope they make a stand alone film about this story.

Up- Obviously you know I'm talking about the first 10 minutes of this film where you see Carl a meet Ellie as a little boy and they become best friends because of their shared love for adventure. We then see them get married and live a happy life together for many many years. But unfortunately when they finally have enough money to go to Paradise Falls, Ellie becomes ill and dies in the hospital with Carl by her side. I remember hearing about how sad the opening scenes were and I didn't believe it until I saw it and started weeping.

Toy Story 3- That moment finally came. Andy has grown up and gave his toys to a new kid (Bonnie). One thing I love about this scene that nobody I know really mentions is that even though Andy is ready to give up his toys to Bonnie now and introduces them to her, when she finds Woody in the box, Andy is originally reluctant to give him away. But he takes a good look at him and Bonnie and realizes that Woody could impact her the same way he impacted him, so he finally parts way with him and the other toys after he plays with them one last time with Bonnie. And Woody saying ""So long partner"" is both heartbreaking and heartwarming.

Raiders Of The Lost Ark- The truck chase scene is probably my favorite action scene of all time. Indiana Jones keeps getting pounded and pounded until finally knocks that dude out of the truck. And it's so great to see an action scene that uses long wide takes, practical effects, and no stupid shaky cam.

Man Of Steel- I know Man Of Steel is a very divisive film, but I consider it to be one of the best comic book films ever made. And the scene where Kal-El tries to fly after getting his suit is not only visually stunning with a brilliant score by Hans Zimmer, it's truly great. And love that smile Henry Cavill gives that truly sells ""Oh my god, I can actually fly!"".

The Dark Knight- I've always loved the relationship between Batman and Joker and the interrogation scene shows why. Batman and Joker are really two sides of the same coin and are both really kind of insane, but the big difference is that Batman fights for very different reasons than Joker. Brilliant scene with great performances from Bale and Ledger.

The King's Speech- That scene where Colin Firth and Geffory Rush are talking to each other during the first session scene. It's just a beautifully shot scene of 2 characters talking to each other for about 6 or 7 minutes and it's incredibly riveting.

Spider-Man 3- Spider-Man 3 is far from a perfect movie, but the Birth of Sandman scene is so brilliant. It's one of the best scenes I've seen in a comic book film actually. It's very powerful scene with no dialougue that shows us how powerful Flint Marko has become as Sandman and how it helps motivate him to continue and try to save his dying daughter. It also has a great score from Christopher Young (Which should be released) and great looking CGi (Especially back in 2007).

E.T.- E.T. Go Home. Such a great happy/sad ending with Elliot finally having to say goodbye to his best friend (Ouch). I wonder if they ever saw each other again?

Drive- The first 5 minutes showing us The Driver's life captures a night time city perfectly. And I love that Ticking Of The Clock music.

The Lion King- The circle Of Life opening features gorgeous animation, brilliant music (I can see why Zimmer won the Oscar), and was a great way to introduce us to our future king, Simba.

The Battle For Mewni- I know this isn't a theatrical film, but I still want to mention Star and Marco's reunion. First of all, it has the most adorable Star and Marco hug in the series and like pretty much all of their other interactions, it feels like genuine best friends. And they could've easily make it awkward because of Star's confession in Starcrushed, but that can wait. All that mattered to them was seeing each other again.

Predator- That moment after an injured Dutch screams ""Get to the choppa!"" and the score kicks in and Dutch is horrified when he escapes and realizes that he's the only guy left and has to stop The Predator on his own.

The Empire Strikes Back- My favorite light saber fight in all the Star Wars movies is the Luke Vs Vader fight at the Empire because of how beautifully shot and choreographed it is (And of course John Williams's score is fantastic). Sure maybe The Phantom Menace Darth Maul fight looks better, but Empire actually has the emotion.

Your Name- I'm not incredibly well versed in anime, but I recently watched Your Name and loved it. Best body swap film I've ever seen and one of the best animated films I've seen (And some of the best animation too). And the ending where Taki and Mitsuha constantly run into each other and feel like they know each other but ignore it, and then finally they meet one afternoon and ask each other for their name was emotionally very satisfying and the perfect way to end this film.

X-Men Apocalypse- Like Spider-Man 3, X-Men Apocalypse is far from a perfect film. But it does have one of the best acted scene I've ever seen in a comic book movie. It's the scene in the forest where one of the officers accidentally kills Magneto's wife and daughter due the daughter's mutant powers finally kicking in. Magneto's mourns the loss of his family, cries his heart out, and begs them to be okay. And then he uses his powers to kill the officers as revenge ans shouts ""IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME? IS THIS WHAT I AM?"". Michael Fassbender's acting in this scene is flawless. You feel Erik's pain and know immediately that the officers are doomed.

War For The Planet Of The Apes- I love the recent Planet Of The Apes trilogy and unlike a lot of people, I consider War the best of the three. I loved it's dark and somber tone, how the war is really a psychological one going on in Caesar's head, the flawless  CGI/performance capture, the score, the new characters (Bad Ape and Nova), Woody Harrelson as the Colonel, Andy Serkis as Caesar, and how it eventually turns into a holocaust film. And the ending with Caesar bringing all the free apes and Nova to a new land and peacefully dies with Maurice (Who finally speaks which it awesome) by his side and happy that he saved his ape family. Beautiful way to end Caesar's story and have him become a legend.

Elf- This is both my favorite comedy and Christmas film because of how well this film balances humor and heart. Will Ferrell will always be Buddy to me and his funniest scene is when the Gimbels manager tells the mall customers that Santa will be here tomorrow and Buddy gleefully shouts ""SANTA!! OH MY GOD!"". Perfectly timed moment and it captures Buddy's innocence and spirit. 

Jurassic Park- ""We have a T Rex"" (RIP Richard Attenborough). Throughout the film Spielberg manages to capture that sense of awe and wonder with all these dinosaurs, but that scene with John Williams iconic score was the perfect moment of that.

Oh and of course, the scene and Samurai Cop where the fat guy gets shot multiple times and dies. Cinematic perfection right there. XD

3,"What Are Some Director Cuts That You Would Like To See Here are some of my personal picks.

Justice League- I'm someone who's a big Zack Snyder fan (Minus Sucker Punch although I haven't seen that director's cut) loves Man Of Steel (I consider it one of the best CBM ever made) and while the theatrical cut of Batman V Superman let me down, The Ultimate Edition/Director's Cut has really grown on me. And I was very excited for Justice League. And when I first saw it I thought it was okay, but after thinking more about it and hearing what was cut/changed, I hope WB gets Zack Snyder back to finish his original rough cut.

Fantastic Four- One of the biggest cinematic disappointments I've ever seen was the 2015 Fantastic Four reboot. I had such high hopes for it because of the director, writer, and cast. And while I didn't hate the film like most people did, it ended up being a bad film and massive letdown. Now we all know about the behind the scenes drama the film went through and that a lot of stuff was cut/changed from Josh Trank's original cut. I'm curious to see what that version would've been like. Hopefully it felt less rushed and had more of that sci fi/horror tone he wanted to do.

Warcraft- A lot of us thought this would be the first great video game movie because it was directed by Duncan Jones. It wasn't. I didn't hate the film, but it felt like a lot was missing. According to Jones, 45 minutes of footage was removed from the film. That's a lot of scenes and could've helped fixed some stuff like poor pacing and better character development.

Assassin's Creed- I'll admit, this is one of those films that I really like that everyone hates, but even I'll admit it has problems. The film is under 2 hours long, but director Justin Kurzel said in a Reddit AMA that his original version was like 2 hours and 25 minutes long. I would love it if Fox and Ubisoft released the original cut and hopefully a lot of the stuff from the novelization is added to the film like Aguilar's past and more details on his bond with Maria, Cal and Sofia's relationship being more fleshed out, and more with Moussa and the other Abstergo prisoners.

The Amazing Spider-Man Films- I quite like Marc Webb's first Amazing Spider-Man and was very disappointed with the second one. I feel like Sony changed/removed a lot of important stuff from the films (Especially the second one) and didn't really let Webb tell his full story (And if you've seen 500 Days Of Summer and Gifted, you'll see the guy has talent).

Rogue One- We all know about the reshoots Rogue One went through and how it led to the product we got. I enjoyed the film but felt it could've been a little more dark in tone and the characters needed more fleshing out. I hear Gareth Edwards's original cut might've had those things.

The Dark Tower- It took 10 years for this movie to finally happen and most people were very disappointed. I thought the film was okay/decent with great performances and interesting lore but rushed. How did that happen? Well apparently Sony did a test screening of the film and after the audience didn't react well to it, they trimmed down Nikolaj Arcel's original 2 and a half hour cut to 95 minutes.

Prometheus- I know this is a very divisive film in the film fan community, but I consider Ridley Scott's Prometheus to be a very bold and interesting sci fi film. I won't deny it has some issues though and based on some of the stuff I've heard that was cut, maybe a director's cut would improve the film.

3,"Why Does This Sub Reddit Often Hate Blockbuster Films? Whenever news about an upcoming blockbuster/franchise film is posted in this Sub Reddit, I almost always see some comments like ""Great another sequel"" or ""More garbage"". I don't understand this type of thinking. A great film is a great film regardless if it's a huge summer blockbuster or a tiny indie drama. And we've seen some great/beloved blockbusters in the last few years like The Planet Of The Apes Trilogy, The Dark Knight Trilogy, X-Men DOFP, Dunkirk, Inception, Mad Max Fury Road, Deadpool, Logan, Captain America The Winter Solider, etc. Those films and many more prove that big fun blockbusters can also be great films. Yes we still get some big crap like Transformers and The Mummy, but that's bound to happen. There's also a lot of indie films that suck ass. And, the success of these blockbusters help these smaller films get funded and produced.

3,"Thoughts On The ""It Was Meant For Kids"" Excuse? I hate it and it always drives me nuts. Whenever a bad kids movie or show comes out (Cough Cough Chipmunks), some people will say ""Well it was meant for kids so that's why it's what it is"". So basically that person is saying that kids are stupid and don't deserve movies/shows with great characters and stories. That's stupid. Look at movies like Lion King, the Toy Story films, Shrek, Finding Nemo, Moana, LEGO Movie, Up, WALL-E, Monsters Inc, Little Mermaid, Zootopia, Wreck it-Ralph, etc. All of those films are technically kids movies, but they're also really good/great films (Those terms aren't mutually exclusive). And if you want to talk about kids cartoons, they've really evolved and gotten better. Shows like Avatar The Last Airbender, Gravity Falls, Spectacular Spider-Man, Star Vs The Forces Of Evil, and Over The Garden Wall prove that. Yes their target audience is kids, but are still able to make great shows that both little kids and grown ups can love.

3,"Thoughts On Junkie XL's Scores I consider myself a fan of them. I loved his collaboration with Hans Zimmer for the Batman V Superman soundtrack, his Mad Max Fury Road score is awesome and pulse pounding, his score for Deadpool worked (Even though I remember the songs more), and I actually really like his music for The Dark Tower (Mainly the track Roland Of Eld). Yeah I know he also scored Amazing Spider-Man 2 (Some of the tracks work, and some are the Electro theme) and the Point Break remake and that horrible Liam Hemsworth film, but everyone has some bad days at work. I'm looking forward to his Tomb Raider theme and hope that we get to hear his original Justice League theme.

3,"Thoughts On The Upcoming Bob's Burgers Movie? I'm excited for it. I don't watch the show on a regular basis, but I'm a fan and I find the show and characters quite funny. And I do think the show is popular enough now to make a successful movie.

As far as the movie's plot goes, like the Simpsons Movie it doesn't really matter that much. Here what matters is the characters and their banter with each other. If the writers can bring that over from the show to the film, I think it's in good hands.

I also hope that the Disney/Fox Deal doesn't affect this movie at all.

So what do you think of the Bob's Burgers movie? Excited? Don't really care? And what's your favorite funny moment from the show? My personal favorite is during the art crawl episode when Louise calls the twins poor deformed orphans. Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"How Do You Feel About The Upcoming Live Action Remake Of Your Name? I finally watched Your Name last week and it was so bloody good. One of the best animated films I've ever seen. If you haven't seen it, it's available on Blu Ray now so please get it.

A few months ago, it was reported that Paramount was developing a live action remake of Your Name with J.J. Abrams and his company Bad Robot producing and hired Arrival and Light's Out writer Eric Heisserer. 

That news has gotten some mixed reactions, but I'm all for it (As long as they don't pull a Psycho and do a shot for shot remake). Yes, some anime would not work well as a live action film (Dragonball proved that), but this type of story (Two teenagers switching bodies and falling for each other by being each other) I believe could work in live action. 

I'm excited to see who else gets involved with this film. So far they've got a good writer. Arrival had a really good screenplay (Yes, I know he was also a writer on the 2010 Elm Street remake, but according to him and some of the cast, the script was heavily changed duo to the studio having a different vision). I actually hope they don't get a big name to direct this film and instead go after lesser known filmmaker. My personal choice is 10 Cloverfield Lane director Dan Trachtenberg (Who has worked with Paramount and Bad Robot before).

And as far as the casting goes, I don't really care either way. I know most anime fans would be upset if they have this film take place in America and cast white actors, but that won't be the reason this film turns out good or bad. If they go with a Japenise cast, cool. If they go with an American cast, also cool with me. All I care about is a good movie.

I don't really understand the hate this live action remake has been getting. It's a no lose situation really. If it turns out good, we get another really good movie. And if it turns out bad, we still have the original film to love. And a live action would bring more attention to the original film and get some of the general audience to watch it.

What do you think of this upcoming remake? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading"
3,"What Happens To Billionaire Boys Club Now I hadn't heard about this movie until a few months ago and found out it was shot two years ago, is based on a true story, stars Taron Egerton, Ansel Elgort, and Kevin Spacey, and the studio plans to release it sometime in 2018.

That was before the Spacey controversy though. Since Sony and Ridley Scott replaced him with Christopher Plummer in All The Money In The World and Netflix shelved the Gore biopic he shot, what happens to this movie now? I doubt it's going  to be released in theaters now and unlike All The Money In the World, I don't think the studio behind Billionaire Boys Club have the resources to replace him like that.

What do you think?"
3,"What's A Movie That You Love Even Though You Aren't The Target Audience? Ten years ago (Wow I can't believe it's been that long) I saw Enchanted with Amy Adams. I know it's a princess movie and I wasn't sure what to think of it, but I ended up loving it. It's the film that made Adams a big star (Deservingly so) and she was so great playing Giselle. She nailed the character's sweetness and the fish out water stuff. It's also one of the very few times animation and live action blended together really well. Highly recommend the film if you haven't seen it.

What's your pick? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Your Name Review Mitsuha and Taki are complete strangers in Japan living separate lives until they suddenly switch places. Mitsuha wakes up in Taki's body, and he in hers. This occurrence happens randomly, and they must adjust their lives around each other. Yet, somehow, it works. They build a connection by leaving notes for one another until they wish to finally meet. But something stronger than distance may keep them apart.

I'll admit, I'm not the biggest anime fan (Even though my favorite show airing now is very anime inspired). I don't dislike it, but I don't go crazy over it either. But this film caught my attention for a couple of reasons. Number one, I'm a sucker for a good body swap film and have always liked the idea of body switching. And two, I had heard nothing but amazing things about this film (A lot of people believe it was snubbed at the Oscars last year). So I finally watched it last night and what did I think?

I absolutely loved it. This is one of the best and most emotional animated films I've ever seen.

Pretty much everyone talks about this film's animation and deservingly so. Every scene is stunning and gorgeous. It's perfect. It's so visually stunning and I couldn't find a single flaw with it (Both with the background scenery and the character designs).

In order for this film to work, you must believe the romance between the 2 leads. I did. It felt very real and genuine and not overly sappy. It was cool that they got to know each other by being each other. 

I watched the English Dub and I was satisfied with the voice acting. Yes, a couple of line deliveries sounded kind of flat and/or rushed here and there, but overall the voice acting is pretty solid (Especially the two leads who really sell their characters and the other one when they switch places).

The direction in this film is great. Not only does the film look fantastic, there isn't really a big boring moment in this film and it flows really well like a nice river. Also, one little thing I noticed that I really liked is that there are a good amount of scenes without any music or score playing. Interesting.

Does the body swap stuff work in the film? Simply put, Yes (This is also the best body swap film I've ever seen). It leads to some really well timed comedy as well (Especially whenever is also involves Mitsuha's little sister). Yes, it also has a lot tropes used in other body swap movies/episodes (Living each others lives, trying to impress the other person's crush, guy touching the girl's boobs, etc), but I thought it worked and it did make me smile and giggle and they didn't overdue some of the tropes. And when they finally revealed what was causing the switch (No spoilers), it was a great and clever surprise that I didn't see coming. And I'm so glad they didn't do the cliched ""The characters still talk the same when they switch"" thing. That's my biggest pet peeve in any body swap movie or show. I find it to be lazy and pandering to the audience. Thankfully, this film doesn't fall into that trap and handles it the right way.

Also (No Spoilers), the ending was perfect. Very emotional (Didn't tear up, but it did give me major feels), touching, and beautiful.

And as far as the songs used in the film, very good (I actually have 2 of them on my Spotify account right now). They fit the tone and story of the film really well.

Now even though I love this movie, it still has a couple of flaws.

While Mitsuha and her family get a lot of fleshing out, Taki didn't get as much. There's something with his dad that's hinted at, but never really explored.

I also felt like we could've seen a bit more of the 2 living each others lives. For example the first time Taki wakes up in Mitsuha's body, you get his first reactions to it, but they cut to the next day and don't let you see him spend that day as her. The cut felt jarring to me and would've liked to have seen what he did that day.

Overall, this a fantastic movie with gorgeous animation and designs, a beautiful romance, and funny body swap moments. I highly recommend buying the Blu Ray and watching this thing.

On a scale of 0 to 5, I'm giving Your Name a 4.5/5. It's one of the best animated films I've ever seen (The Toy Story films are still the kings for me) and the best body swap film I've ever seen.

But as always, this is just my opinion. What did you think of Your Name if you've seen it? Do you love it and consider it a masterpiece or did you find it very overrated? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"Favorite Pixar Films? I'm a fan of western animation and Pixar is probably the king of western animation films. Sure they have a couple of stinkers (Cars 2, Brave), but overall they have an excellent track record and have made some truly amazing films.

Here are some of my favorite films they've done.

The Toy Story Trilogy- I have this trilogy in my Top 5 favorite films of all time. I loved these characters my whole life. Can you imagine anyone else besides Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as Woody and Buzz? My personal favorite film of the series is the third one. I find it to be the most emotional and it was a great way to end the series while at the same time setting up new adventures with the toys (Which is why I'm very excited for Toy Story 4).

Finding Nemo- A great movie about the relationship between a father and son. Beautiful underwater animation as well. We all talk about Ellen Degenerous as Dory (Just keep swimming) as deservingly so, but I feel like we overlook how great Albert Brooks was as Marlin. He really nailed the whole protective father thing.

Wall-E- A fantastic sci fi film that should've been nominated for Best Picture. It's a great dystopian future film and a great film that explores our obsession and reliance on technology without a lot of dialogue (You hear a lot of Wall-E and Eve-E though).

Up- The first 10 minutes of this film alone is Oscar worthy. It's very touching and sad. And the rest of the film is great too (Even if it isn't as emotional as the first 10 minutes). Carl and Russel form this great father and son like bond, it has some of the best animation in a Pixar film, and Doug The Dog is hilarious and awesome (Squirrel!).

Ratatouille- The Pixar film that will always make me hungry for a big meal. Great movie that reminds you about following your dreams (Anyone can cook).

A Bug's Life- I feel like this is Pixar's forgotten film. I never hear anybody talk about A Bug's Life (I watched it a lot as a kid and have always laughed at the But it's a rock"" scene). And that's a shame because this is a really good movie about standing up to bullies and not letting yourself or others get pushed around. 

Monsters Inc- Similar to the earlier question about picturing someone else besides Tom Hanks and Tim Allen voicing Woody and Buzz, can you picture anyone else voicing Sully and Mike besides John Goodman and Billy Crystal? These 2 had fantastic chemistry together and their relationship with Boo was adorable (And the goodbye scene is perfect).

What are your favorite Pixar films? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading."
3,"Are You A Fan Of Movie Novelizations? I was never really into the idea of reading them since I thought it was just the film as a book. But I later heard that the novelization for the Assassin's Creed movie had several key things that weren't in the film or had been cut. So I read it a couple of weeks ago and it adds a good amount of stuff to the film (It answers why Cal killed the pimp, gives you more backstory for Aguilar and the Abstergo prisoners, fleshes out Cal and Sofia's relationship more, etc). I'm shocked all of this was removed from the film as it would've made it better.

What's your favorite movie novelization and what's one that really adds to the film? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"About Some Movies Being ""Too Dark And Serious"" I love movies. They're the greatest form of storytelling IMO. And we can get many different types of films (Which is awesome). But lately, I've noticed some people calling a movie too dark and/or serious while criticizing it or explaining why it flopped at the box office.

I remember when Batman V Superman came out last year and a lot of people called it too dark and serious and grim (Yet they're totally fine with The Dark Knight Trilogy being very dark and grim and serious). I get that not a lot of people liked that film (I was disappointed with the theatrical cut due to the poor editing and story structure, but the Ultimate Cut is really good IMO) and that's fine considering film is subjective, but I don't understand that complaint. The film is about Bruce Wayne wanting revenge on Kal-El for the destruction he caused 2 years ago while the world is divided if there should be a Superman. Would you want that story to be light hearted and funny? I wouldn't ( I fear we would get another Batman And Robin if that happened). IMO, that story should be taken more seriously than something like Guardians Of The Galaxy (Which was very light hearted and great because of it).

I also heard some people complain about this with the Assassin's Creed film. I know I'm one of the very few people that liked the film (Though it has problems). But once again, I don't think tone was the problem. The film shows us a world where Assassins and Templars have been fighting for an ancient artifact over philosophical differences for centuries. The film is also a redemption story when it comes to Callum Lynch's arc and ends with him accepting his destiny as an Assassin. I don't think that should be portrayed in a light hearted way.

Last month, I put up a post asking why War For The Planet Of The Apes ended up being a box office disappointment and some people responded by saying that since the film was the darkest and most somber of the trilogy (The film is really kind of a Holocaust movie and a revenge thriller), people just weren't interested and went to see Spider-Man Homecoming (A more light hearted film) instead (Although Dunkirk came out a week later and a lot people went to see that and that was a very serious war film). This still surprises me considering how beloved and successful Rise and Dawn were.

I don't hate light hearted or fun movies/shows at all (My favorite show airing right now is Star Vs The Forces Of Evil for heaven's sake and you should give it a shot), but these specific films and the stories they were trying to tell I believe should've been dark and serious and I don't understand how that's a problem.

But as always, this is just my opinion. Let me know what you think  in the comments. Do you agree or disagree and why? And thanks for reading."
3,"Would You Want To See Zack Snyder's Original Cut Of Justice League? My answer would be yes. I'll admit, I actually had fun watching the theatrical cut of JL (Mainly because of the League themselves). My expectations were lowered heavily do to mediocre reviews and I went in prepared to be let down. But, leaving the theater, I had a smile on my face. I enjoyed it (Although it is very very flawed).

That being said, after hearing  lot of leaked info about what was cut out/changed from Snyder's original cut, I think they should've released that version of the film. Some of my biggest problems with the film were that I felt like it was too short and some aspects felt rushed, some of the humor really falls flat (Some of it does work though IMO), the score didn't impress me, they changed Batman's character from BVS, and Steppenwolf was a underdeveloped generic villain. Based on the stuff that was apparently in the Snyder cut, it sounds like a lot of those problems could've been fixed. The original cut was close to 3 hours, Batman was more serious, Junkie XL composed the score, some of the bad jokes are no longer there, characters like Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg get a little more developed, Superman's  return makes more sense now (The Codex from MOS) and you find out more about Steppenwolf's motivations (Trying to save his mother.

3,"So Now The Only Studio That Will Give Us Different Types Of Marvel Movies Is Sony It's now official. Bob Igor confirmed that X-Men, Deadpool, and Fantastic Four would all be joining the MCU eventually (Not next year as New Mutants, Deadpool 2, and X-Men Dark Phoenix are coming out). Which means they'll have to make them fit the MCU and not do something majorly different like DOFP, Logan, The Dark Knight, etc.

But remember this. There is still one studio that owns Marvel characters that seems to be willing to take big risks with CBM like Fox did. Next year, Sony is releasing their Venom movie as an R rated sci fi action horror film based on the comics The Lethal Protector and Planet Of The Symboytes. How awesome does that sound? And it's been attracting major (And somewhat selective) talent like the Zombieland director, the Saving Mr Banks writer, WETA, Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, Woody Harrelson, Riz Ahmed, Jenny Slate, and Scott Haze. I think this has the potential to be something really special.

Sony also has the Silver And Black movie in February 2019. I was hesitant about this idea at first, but after after hearing the director describe it has the CBM version of Thelma And Louise, I got more intrigued. And potentially R rated action/romance film about Silver Sable and Black Cat sounds kind of interesting to me. And the fact that this is set to start filming before Venom comes out tells me Sony really believes in what they're doing.

They also have the Morbius movie in the works. I'm interested, but I want to find out who the director is and what the tone will be before I get too excited.

3,"Now That Disney Has Acquired Fox's Assets, Will They Reboot Assassin's Creed I think there is a chance they could. Not anytime soon though as the first film has the stench of failure attached to it (Even though I really liked it). I think at some point either Disney or another studio (Maybe they sell it off to another studio) will give AC another try due to how popular the franchise is. There's also that Netflix AC show coming out soon, and maybe if that works out like the Castlevania show did, interest for another film may go up. I just hope that if Disney is the one to make the next film, they don't tone it down for the family. 

What do you think? Comment and let me know. Thanks for reading."
3,"Most Surprising Movie News Stories Of The Year? Here are my picks (In no particular order) .

Ben Affleck No Longer Directing Batman (And Maybe No Longer Playing Batman)- I think Affleck is a great director (Films like The Town and Argo prove that) and I was really looking forward to seeing his take on The Caped Crusader ( After watching BVS, I think he's the best live action Batman). Ever since he was cast as the character in 2013, I always assumed he would direct the Batman solo movies. So it came as a surprise that he dropped out of directing. And now it's looking more and more likely that he not even be Batman after Justice League. i'm still excited for Matt Reeves's new trilogy, but I'll really miss Affleck.

Christopher Plummer Replacing Kevin Spacey In All The Money In the World- While it was probably the right move for Sony and Ridley Scott to do this after the Spacey controversy, I originally thought it would be impossible to do this and still keep the planned December 22 release date because I assumed J Paul Getty was in a lot of the film (Which was incorrect). But apparently they've pulled it off and Sony really believes in the film.

Tom Hardy And Michelle Williams Starring In Sony's Venom- The reason the casting of Hardy and Williams surprised me is because they are known to be very picky about the films they'll get involved in (Which is why they have great track records). In Williams case, I've heard she's turned down a lot of blockbusters before. So they're casting adds a lot of credibility to this movie.

Lady Bird Breaking The RT Record- Now I'm really excited for this movie. Greta Gerwig's directorial debt has 100% on RT with 185 reviews, beating Toy Story 2's record of staying at 100% with 163 reviews. Never thought any film would beat that. Impressive.

A Live Action Dora The Explorer- Even though Michael Bay isn't really producing the film, the fact that they are making a live action Dora movie with Bay's Company producing is still baffling and shows that society is slowly crumbling.

Justice League Possibly Losing WB Money- Who would've ever thought this would be possible? The first live action JL movie with iconic and beloved characters like Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman, etc making under 100 opening weekend and possibly losing the studio money. That's shocking. Even though JL got mixed to negative reviews, you'd still expect it to do well. BVS and SS were slammed by most critics and still made over 870 and 740 million worldwide.

What are the movie news stories that shocked you the most? Comment and let me know. Thanks for reading."
3,"Movies You Don't Watch Because Of The Director? I know that we should separate the art from the artist and most of the time I can do that, but when it comes to Roman Polanski, I just can't. Other than watching a few minutes of Carnage (Which I watched before knowing who he was), I've never watched any of his films. I hear films like Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby and his Macbeth adaptation are great, but I refuse to watch them. And I know that sounds weird considering those films are classics, but I know that if I watch any film he directs, I won't be able to separate his art from his crime. It's not just that he molested a kid that disturbs me, it's the fact that he actually got away with it and was never punished for doing it.

So whenever I see that Polanski is directing a film, I have no interest in it. I'm not trying to say that people who still enjoy his films are wrong. I'm glad they can enjoy them and separate the art from the artist, but for me I know I won't be able to do it.

What do you think? Which director turns you off and why? Comment and let me know. Thanks for reading."
3,"Spidey's Thoughts Of The Day- Gyllenhaal Might Be The Next Batman, Deadpool 2 Trailer Jake Gyllenhaal as the next Batman- So John Campea said on his show today that's he's heard from friends connected to WB that Matt Reeves wants Louis Bloom himself Jake Gyllenhaal to star in his new Batman trilogy. If this happens, I would still be heartbroken that Ben Affleck is leaving the role, but Jake is a good replacement (I still kind of wanted him to play The Riddler though).

Is The Crow Reborn Finally Happening- Jason Mamoa recently teased that the Crow remake may be starting production very soon with Corin Hardy directing. I still refuse to believe this movie is happening soon until I see a picture of Mamoa and Hardy on set making the film. The Crow reboot has been in the works for almost 10 years. Actors like James Mcavoy, Bradly Cooper, Tom Hiddleston, Luke Evens, and Jack Huston have all been cast as The Crow and have all dropped out. I think it's time for another Crow film, but I won't believe it till I see it. 

James Franco Is Multiple Man- Well that's surprising. James Franco is going to star in a solo X-Men universe film about Multiple Man. When I first saw this headline, I thought it was a really dumb idea, however I also thought the same thing about the X Universe show Legion and that ended up being amazing. And I've loved what Fox has been doing with these X-Men spin offs like Deadpool and Logan (And New Mutants looks really good too), so maybe this could be something special.

First Trailer For Deadpool 2- Finally. Yesterday 20th Century Fox dropped the first trailer for Deadpool 2. You get to see Deadpool mimicking Bob Ross painting a picture and than you get to see some footage of the film. Pretty clever and funny marketing. Still wanted to see a shot of Josh Brolin as Cable, but I'm sure we'll get that in trailer 2.

3,"Why Did War For The Planet Of The Apes Underperform At The Box Office? This has always shocked me. War For The Planet Of The Apes is a triumph IMO and one of the best blockbusters ever made. And yet, it only made 489 million worldwide.

I don't understand why. It had everything going for it.

1. It's a great film- I've already told you I loved it, but that's also the case for the majority of critics and pundits. It has a RT score of 93%. a Metacritic score of 82%, and a lot of critics calling it one of the best films of the year (Fox is even trying to push it for Best Picture).

2. It was coming off another great and successful film- When Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes came out in 2014, it was a major critical and commercial success. It made 709 million worldwide, has a RT score of 90%, a Metacritic score of 79%, and a lot of critics called it one of the best films of the year.

3. This movie had great trailers- Most people will agree that the trailers were fantastic. Don't really have much else to add.

Some people might say that the reason War underperformed is because it came out in July, but keep in mind Dawn also opened in July and was a huge hit.

What do you think the reason is? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading."
3,"My Super Late Review Of The Dark Tower So last night, I finally watched Sony's adaptation of The Dark Tower. I've never read the books, but this film always interested me. I meant to see it in theaters, but do to other commitments I missed it. I've heard a lot of bad things about the film and it's production and my expectations were lowered. And that might've been a good thing.

I actually kind of enjoyed it. It's not flawless and it has some big problems, but overall, I was glad that I watched it and wouldn't mind getting the Blu Ray.

Let's talk about the good stuff about Dark Tower. First of all, the kid who plays Jake, Tom Taylor, was great. The whole movie hinges on his performance. Jake is a very troubled kid and Taylor sold it. 

Speaking of the acting, Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey are great as The Gunslinger and The Man In Black. Yes, The MIB in this film is kind of over the top and corny (Although I've heard that the character is kind of like that in the books), but I was entertained by it and you could tell McConaughey was having fun playing this super evil character. As far as Elba's performance goes, great. The Gunslinger is also a very broken character. He's the last of his kind wanting revenge on The Man In Black. And Elba brought his A game to that (And to some of the fish out of water comedy scenes). He's also a total badass with some really cool gunslinging action.

The world (Or Worlds) they set up was great. Very rich and creative with a lot of franchise potential. I just wish we saw more of it on screen.

Most of the action is very good as well (Even though most of the best moments were already shown in the trailer). It's not mind blowing or anything (Except for The Gunslingers kills), but still very fine.

There's also a nice father and son bond that forms between The Gunslinger and Jake that I found very touching and believable. Taylor and Elba have really good chemistry in this film.

Junkie XL's score was also really well done. I'll be adding that to my Spotify account.

All of that being said though, this movie still has some big issues.

My biggest problem with this film is actually how short it is. The film is only 95 minutes long (With credits) and because of that the film moves very fast and you don't get to really go in depth about Mid World, the skin monsters, more about the Sayre character, the magic balls The MIB has, how The Gunslinger is immune to the MIB's magic, what's The Crimson King, where did the Tower come from, etc. I know there's like an hour of footage that got cut and I would love to see an extended cut to see if it fleshes things out more.

The film also relies a lot on exposition dialogue. Exposition dialogue isn't always a bad thing, but when films over use it it can feel kind of lazy. I get that this type of film probably needs some exposition, but I wished they showed more than they told.

Sometimes, the film can feel kind of choppy (Part of that may be because of what happened between the director and Sony). It's not Suicide Squad level messy, but you can tell that this film when through extensive reshoots and had a lot of scenes removed. Some scene transitions feel very off, like there was supposed to be another scene in between them or the previous scene was supposed to be longer.

Also, while I liked aspects of the ending, it felt very rushed. It didn't feel like the film was ready to end yet. And the way they defeat the MIB is very quick and disappointing. They kind of wasted him.

Overall, The Dark Tower isn't a great movie and it has problems with some of it's pacing, structure, and length, but I found it to be an entertaining action fantasy film with great lead performances and an interesting world/lore. I don't think it deserves a 15% on RT. It's not a disaster like The Last Airbender, Dragonball Evolution, or Mortal Kombat Annihilation. I would like to see more of this world adapted. I know a sequel is unlikely, but I hope the planned TV show happens.

I give The Dark Tower a surprising 3.5/5

3,"Spidey's Thoughts Of The Day- Deathstroke Solo Movie, Screen Junkies Returns, Shazam Casting Happy Halloween guys. http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9GB4198gnNA/TxOLQNdSbII/AAAAAAAAAdE/J3XMrn_7feY/s1600/the-fly-1986-jeff-goldblum22.jpg

Deathstroke Movie- It's been confirmed that Gareth Evens (The Raid 1 and 2) will be directing a solo film about Deathstroke with Joe Manganiello still attached to play the character. At first I wasn't sure how to feel about this, but now I think this could be a really cool R rated action film. The sad thing is that this probably means Deathstroke is no longer in the Batman solo film. And that sucks because I was really looking forward to seeing a villain that could physically challenge Batman in this DCCU. But I still trust Matt Reeves (Especially after seeing War For The Planet Of The Apes. Why didn't more people go to see it?).

The return of Screen Junkies- Screen Junkies has started uploading videos again for the first time since the day before the Any Signore controversy got revealed. Many people wondered if Screen Junkies could survive that. I'm happy they did not just because I'm a fan of their's, but also because I don't think the horrible actions of 1 person should ruin a ton of other people's careers.

Shazam Casting- SHAZAM! (I'm sorry. Had to do that). So Zachery Levi is Shazam. Didn't see that coming. Was expecting a bigger name to be honest. But I think this is really good casting. I can buy that he's a boy trapped in a man's body.

Black Adam Gets Writer- So The Rock's Black Adam movie is going to be written by the person who wrote Alvin And The Chipmunks The Road Chip? Why? Just why? First of all, I don't really see how a Black Adam solo film could work. And now they've got the Chipmunks writer on bored. Hopefully magic happens and this film is awesome.

3,"Spidey's Thoughts Of The Day- Justice League Updates, X-23 Solo Movie?, Power Rangers 2 Probably Dead (I guess this is now going to be something I do every Tuesday and Thursday)

Justice League News- Some big JL news this week.

With Justice League coming out in just a couple of weeks (Hype!), many of us are wondering when the early reviews will be coming out. According to Indie Revolver, WB is embargoing reviews until the morning of Wednesday November 15. That's 2 days before the film comes out and usually when a studio waits that long before allowing critics to put out their reviews, that's a sign that the film isn't that good. However, I don't actually think that's the day the embargo lifts. Remember, WB also embargoed Wonder Woman reviews until 2 days before the film's release, but they actually lifted it a week earlier. I think that November 15 date is just a placeholder and the actual JL reviews will be released a week before the film is in theaters.

It's also being reported that the film's runtime is 121 minutes (The shortest runtime for a DCCU film so far). Some people are saying that's a bad sign and a JL film can't work as an 121 minute film. We won't know that until we see the movie. I'm never concerned when I hear how long or short a film is. I wait until I see the film and then I decide if I think the film was too long, too short, or just right.

The film is also tracking to make between 110-120 million domestically on opening weekend. That's pretty impressive, but I think if the early reviews are amazing, I think it will push it to 150 million.

X-23 May Get A Solo Film- James Mangold (Logan, Walk The Line) confirmed in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that they're working on an X-23 solo movie. I love this idea. Laura/X-23 was one of the big reasons why Logan was such a masterpiece of the comic book movie genre and Dafne Keen has a bright future ahead of hear. And while the end of Logan was a perfect true conclusion, it also opened the door for another film focusing on Laura and the other mutant kids who escaped.

Michael Bay Not Actually Involved With Dora The Explorer- One of the strangest movie stories I've ever heard was that Bad Boys and Transformers director Michael Bay would be producing a live action Dora movie. Well as it turns out he's not. Paramount told Collider that Bay himself is not involved with the project, but his company is. For me that's a relief because it just sounded like such an odd decision. I still have my doubts about a Dora movie working as a live action film, but than again I didn't think a LEGO movie would work either. So surprises can happen.

Power Rangers 2 Most Likely Dead In The Water- In my opinion, this year's Power Rangers film was very underrated. I appreciated how the film took it's time with the teens and the bond they had. However, I know not everyone loved it and do that well at the box office. I was still hopeful that a sequel could still happen. Looks like I'm wrong. Apparently Saban is not going to renew the license to use the new PR movie logo. This disappoints me because I really wanted to see more of this world.

What do you think of these news stories? Comment and let me know. Thanks."
3,"Spidey's Thoughts Of The Day- Phantom Thread Trailer, Venom Starts Filming, A Michael Bay Dora?! Back in July, I made a big post talking about a lot of the movie and TV news that week. But after posting it, I wasn't sure if I wanted to do anymore or if it was working. But today I've decided to revive it with a few changes. I'll just give my thoughts on some of the the movie news this week, no tv reviews no reviews (Those are separate posts).

Without further ado, here we go.

First Trailer Released For The Phantom Thread- Back in June, all of us film fans were saddened to hear that Daniel Day Lewis would be retiring from acting after he finished Phantom Thread (I don't know if I 100% believe that, but that's another story). Yesterday, the first trailer dropped. And I didn't love it. I'm not saying it looks bad, but it didn't move me the way I wanted it too. I don't have an answer as to why that's the case, but it just is. Still, it looks like decent slow paced love story with an amazing performance from DDL and excellent set and costume designs. I can't wait to see this film, but I feel like the first trailer should've been better.

Box Office Results- Coming in first place was Boo 2 directed by Tyler Perry. These Madea films aren't going away any time soon unfortunately. I actually think Perry has some talent as an actor (Watch him in Gone Girl), but I wish he'd stop with these Madea holiday films. But the 2 bombs this weekend were Geostorm (Coming in second place) and The Snowman (Coming in eighth place). Geostorm bombing wasn't really a surprise considering how incredibly dumb the plot sounds and how terrible the reviews were. I can't imagine that Dean Devlin will be directed another big budget film any time soon. The Snowman flopping critically and commercially bums me out since I'm a big Michael Fassbender fan and the premise sounded great. But according to the reviews, it seems to be a boring unfinished mess. I don't think this will really effect Fassbender's career though since he wasn't involved with the film creatively and that most of us know how great of an actor he is. Plus, X-Men Dark Phoenix comes out next November. Good news if he wants a surefire hit.

Early Thor Ragnarok Reviews- Last Thursday, the review embargo for Thor Ragnarok lifted and the reviews have been bloody spectacular. It currently has a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes and most reviewers seem to agree that it's the best film in the Thor series. I'm very excited for the film and these reviews do increase my excitement, but I'll admit I'm a little cautious because the last 2 MCU films (Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 and Spider-Man Homecoming) disappointed me. Also, it will be hard to beat the firs Thor movie for me. I love that film and think it's one of Marvel's best. If it is better, just wow.

Michael Bay Producing A Dora The Explorer Movie?- This is the strangest movie news story I've heard all year. When I first saw this, I thought it was fake until I realized The Hollywood Reporter was running with it. Why is this happening? I can understand the appeal of an animated Dora movie for kids, but a live action movie about a teenage Dora produced by Michael Bay? I think I know what I'm in for and it doesn't sound good.

Venom Begins Production- Finally. Sony's Venom film started filming yesterday. The film is now a reality and my wish is coming true. I expect we'll see some big behind the scenes pics and more casting info (Carnage) very soon. It was also confirmed by Andy Serkis that Tom Hardy will be playing Venom through motion capture. Smart move. You can't do Venom right with a practical costume.

Pacific Rim/Godzilla/King Kong Crossover?- Pacific Rim 2 director Steven Deknight recently said that there have been some discussions about incorporating Pacific Rim into the Godzilla/Kong universe. In theory, that sounds awesome. Imagine Gypsy Danger fighting both Kong and Godzilla. But when you really think about it, it might not be the best idea since Pacific Rim has a very different tone than the Monsterverse films so far.

What do you think of the recent news? Comment and let me know. Thanks for reading. :0)"
3,"So Apparently Venom Starts Filming This Monday. What Are Your Expectations For The Film I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think this is my most anticipated superhero film of 2018. I've always wanted a Venom movie since I was a little kid, but when I first heard about this version of the film, I hated it. I thought it was a horrible idea to make a Venom film without Spider-Man. But once I heard that Tom Hardy was playing Eddie Brock and that it would be a sci fi horror film, I was sold. I'm now fully convinced this movie will be good (Could be wrong, but I have faith). I think this will be the X-Men First Class of 2018. The superhero film everyone expects to suck, but surprises everyone. I don't even care that Spidey isn't in the film. Let this be a true Venom story.

I'm so thrilled that the film starts filming in a couple of days (According to Omega Underground). My wish is finally coming true. Let's hope it's good.

What do you think of Venom? Why are you excited or skeptical about the film? Thanks."
3,"What Would Your Ten Movie Wishes Be? I know it's supposed to be three wishes, but that isn't enough!

Anyway, Here are my wishes (In no particular order).

1. A sequel to Zack Snyder's Legend Of The Guardians The Owls Of Ga'Hoole.

2. An R rated gritty revenge thriller western directed and written by Damien Chazelle starring Tom Hardy as the protagonist and Michael Fassbender as the villain.

3. A good Fantastic Four movie that's a sci fi adventure film, separate from the MCU, and is directed by J.J. Abrams and written by Alex Hirsch. And have it lead to a Silver Surfer spin off.

4. A Chronicle sequel with Josh Trank and Max Landis involved.

5. Steven Spielberg directing a Star Wars spin off.

6. An Assassin's Creed sequel.

7. A stand alone Squirrel Girl movie starring Eden Sher that's kind of like the tame version of Deadpool.

8. Another attempt at Freddy Vs Jason.

9. A documentary about the making of Fant4stic

10. A good reboot of The Last Airbender.

What would your wishes be? Comment and let me know. And thanks for reading.

Oh, and one honorable mention, get Spider-Man out of the MCU."
3,"What Will The Venom Film's Plot Be? Based on some of the new info and rumors that have been coming out, I think I may have a good guess.

A few weeks ago, a casting call for Venom went out, looking for actors to play mercenaries. My guess is that Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock is part of this group of mercenaries in the beginning of the film. This group is later recruited by some corporation where Jenny Slate's scientist character works. They have been trying to create something powerful (The Venom suit) to fight crime and plan to test it out on the mercinaries. They test it out on Brock and turn him into Venom and he becomes an anti hero. The film focuses a lot on Eddie and the symboyote forming this deep and unbreakable bond. They feel like they're nothing without each other. Later, one of the other suits escapes from the facility and bonds with the murderous Cletus Kassidy, and they become Carnage.

If this is actually what happens in the solo Venom film, I like it. I know it's a very different origin for the character, but I think it can work if they execute it well.

What do you think? "
3,"Was Assassin's Creed Actually A Box Office Failure? We all know the film was a critical failure (Even though I enjoyed it for what it was), but I remember shortly after the film came out seeing articles about how the film could loose Fox a lot of money. But was it actually a huge box office failure?

A movie needs to make twice as much as it's production budget to break even. From what I've read, Assassin's Creed cost 120 million  dollars to make. So multiply that by 2 and it seems that the film needed to make 240 million to break even and cover the production and marketing budgets. And it did make 240 million worldwide. 

So it looks like the film wasn't the huge failure a lot of us thought it was. Whether or not the film gets a sequel is still up in the air. I doubt it because of the negative reviews, Fassbender's busy schedule, and the fact that it only broke even instead of making a huge profit. I would be interested in seeing one because like I said I'm one of the few people who liked it, but I wouldn't bet on it happening (I actually think it might work better as a TV show, which they are making on Netflix). But then again, stranger things have happened and you can't say never.

What do you think?"
3,"Favorite Zack Snyder Film? I've noticed that Zack Snyder gets a lot of hate on this SubReddit. I'm a little surprised by that, sure he's made some stinkers like Sucker Punch, but he's also given us really good stuff in my opinion.

My favorite Snyder films are Watchmen (I actually like the Director's Cut of the film better than the comic), Man Of Steel (The most underrated superhero film IMO), and the animated film Guardians Of Ga'Hoole. If you haven't seen it, you should. It's not just some kids movie about owls, it can get pretty dark.

What are your picks?"
3,"Does All The Star Wars Director Drama Concern You About The Future Films? It does for me. 

It first happened with Josh Trank when he was supposed to direct a solo Boba Fett film. Then he wasn't at Celebration and then a few weeks later he left the film. Some people would argue that his departure was because of the Fant4stic production trouble rumors (And they were probably right), but those rumors were around months before Trank left. So why wouldn't they fire him or ask him to leave earlier?

Recently, it happened with Phil Lord and Chris Miller with Han Solo. They had 85% of the film done and then Lucasfilm fired them. Why wait until then? I know the reports say that they might've gone a little off course, but why would you wait until then to fire them?

And now it's happen with Colin Trevorrow with Episode 9.

And even though Garreth Edwards directed Rogue One, a lot of the film was reshot (Some of it without him).

So the big question is ""Does Disney really check with these directors and make sure they're on the same page?"". It doesn't look like that.

What do you think?"

3,"My Thoughts On The Rogue One Phantom Menacing Video By Chris Stuckmann I know this video happened months ago, but I originally held back on making a post about it because I wasn't entirely sure how I felt about it. But now I feel ready to talk about it.

I'm a fan of Chris Stuckmann. I've been watching him since 2014 and own his book and I think he's one of the best and smartest Youtube critics out there. I admire his passion for movies and film making, that he's a true geek like all of us, and that he isn't afraid to have an unpopular opinion about a film. I sometimes disagree with his opinions (I like The Amazing Spider-Man and Assassin's Creed, I felt Arrival and Fences and Spider-Man Homecoming were overrated, etc), but I still respect them.

That being said, I do have an issue with his video Rogue One And Phantom Menacing. In the video, he talks about how thinks that Star Wars fans may be forcing themselves to love Rogue One in a simaler way that a lot of fans tricked themselves into loving Phantom Menace in 1999 (Phantom Menacing). Now, there's nothing wrong with Stuckmann or anyone else not liking Rogue One and having major problems with it (Some of the issues he brings up I agree with even though I did like it) because all film is subjective. But accusing people of only liking it because the wanted to feels wrong to me. Are there some people who Phantom Menaced Rogue One? Probably (I Phantom Menaced The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Gravity Falls Season 2), but they are in the minority. Most of the critics and fans loved/really liked Rogue One. Doesn't mean you have to like it if you don't, but it's the truth. 

He also says in the video ""If you admit that this film has the same problems I have with it, then it's okay if you like it"". The thing is, not everyone has the same opinion on films that you do Chris. Those problems that you mentioned may not bother others. Film is like art. If you hang a painting up, people will see different things. When those same people watch a film, they will see different things and have a different experience.

Look, like I said, I like Stuckmann, and I still do (Even though his humor can be a bit awkward at times). But I feel like this video was really poorly put together. I don't think he was trying to offend anyone, but it came across that way.

Just wanted to get my feelings out there. What do you think. Thanks."
3,"My Thoughts On Collider Now I've been following Movie Talk since 2013 when it was part of AMC. I loved the show and it's the reason I'm talking to you guys right now. All of the guys there had great personalities and you could tell that they really loved films (Big blockbusters and small indies). I continued to follow them when it became Collider Movie Talk in 2015. I still enjoyed the show, but now some of the changes have caused me to not have the immediant urge to watch their videos. Some of the changes include.

John Campea leaving.

Some of their weekly shows (Heroes, TV Talk) becoming daily shows.

More and more connections to the Schmoes Know (I like Kristian and Mark on Movie Talk, but it's kind of started to feel like Schmoes Movie Talk now)

Some of the rumors they've been discussing like it's fact. I'm not saying they're trying to mislead us, but they sometimes act like some of these rumors (Ben Affleck leaving the DCEU, Joss Whedon reshooting half of JL) are 100 confirmed when that's not the case. Maybe there assumptions are true, but don't act like it's confirmed until it is.

I'm not trying to hate on the guys at Collider. I still like them and I still watch their videos sometimes, but I don't have the urge to watch them (Or to watch the shows live). I the AMC days."
3,"Who's An Actor/Actress That You See Big Potential In? I think that Eden Sher could have a big future in Hollywood. Most of you probably know her as the dorky and lovable Sue Heck from the ABC sitcom The Middle. I'm not a big fan of the show as a whole, but I think the main cast is excellent with Sher being the main stand out. She plays Sue incredibly well in both the comedic scenes and the more serious scenes and has gotten several Critic's Choice Awards nominations for a reason (And a lot of TV critics believe she's been snubbed at The Emmys.)

Sher's other big role is voicing magical princess Star Butterfly in the Disney animated series Star Vs The Forces Of Evil. I know voice acting is different from on screen acting, but she crushes the role. What makes it even more special is that Star Vs was her first time doing voice over work, so you'd think her voice acting would be kind of rough, but it's not. Sher's delivery makes a lot of Star's lines very memorable and similar to Sue Heck, it's not a one note performance. Yes Star is a cheerful and energetic teen, but she does have depth (Especially in season 2).

The one obstacle Sher could run into is being typecasted as Sue Heck in other movies and shows. Hopefully she starts playing other types of roles in smaller projects and doing more voice work to avoid that. I believe she has the talent to do it.

What do you think? Who's your pick? Thanks for reading."

3,"Any Upcoming Sony Films You're Excited About? For the lat couple of years, I've noticed we as film fans like to bash Sony a lot (Sometimes fairly, sometimes unfairly). But I wanted to know if their are any upcoming Sony films you want to see? Because I have some.

1. Venom. When they first announced that they would be making a Venom film that wouldn't be part of the MCU, I thought it was a dumb idea. But after hearing that it will be an R Rated Sci Fi Horror film about Venom fighting Carnage starring Tom Hardy, I'm sold. Can't wait to see this movie!

2. Masters Of The Universe. I was never a He-Man fan as a kid, but I think the He-Man Mythos and Eternia have great potential to work on the big screen. Glad that the studio fired McG from the project. I wonder who will direct now?

3. Jumanji. To me, the original Jumanji isn't a classic (It's good, but not great). So I'm with them changing some stuff. And I like that The Rock and Kevin Hart are teaming up again after Central Intelligence.

4. Uncharted. Most video game movies suck, but I think Uncharted has great potential simply because of the character of Nathan Drake. I love what Shawn Levy did with Real Steel and Stranger Things and trust him. And while I was surprised by Tom Holland's casting at first, it's grown on me.

5. Metal Gear Solid. I've never played any of MGS, but like Uncharted, I think this project could turn into a great movie. And I like what Jordan V Roberts did with The Kings Of Summer and Kong Skull Island.

6. 23 Jump Street. I loved 21/22 Jump Street like most people did so of course I want a third film. I hope that they abandon the MIB crossover idea and get Lord and Miller back to direct.

7. Goosebumps 2. I didn't love the first movie, but I thought it set up a cool world and a sequel has me intrigued.

8. The Animated Spider-Man Film. While Peter Parker is the true Spider-Man, Miles Morales is a cool character and could make a good film. Plus you have Lord and Miller producing the film and Alex Hirsch serving as a creative consultant.

What are your picks? Thanks."
3,"Why Are People Apprehensive About Shawn Levy Directing Uncharted? I don't get it. Levy has proven he has talent. Yes I know he directed that bad Pink Panther remake, but he also directed that great film Real Steel. That was a film that surprised all of us. We all thought it would just be Rock and Sock em robots, but it turned out to well told story about a father and a son. He also produced Arrival and directed some really good episodes of Stranger Things. And while the Night At The Museum films aren't classics, they're good for what they are.

Some people may try to bring up that Levy has never directed an action film before. But neither did the Russo Brothers or Peyton Reed and their films worked out pretty well. 

Look, I was surprised when Levy was announced as the new director. I wouldn't have considered him before the announcement last year, but I do think it's an interesting choice and could work.

What do you think?"
3,"I Think Another Nightmare On Elm Street Remake Could Be Better Than The Original Film Look, I love the original Nightmare On Elm Street. The first time I saw it, I was kind of scared to go to bed. But let's admit it, while it's still a great and scary film, it is also dated. A lot of the special effects are poor and aside from Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger, most of the acting is terrible. And a good modern day remake could improve those things.

I think it's a good idea for New Line Cinema and Warner Brothers to take another shot at the Elm Street franchise. I know they remade it in 2010 and it disappointed a lot of people, but I think it's worth another try. Plus, I don't think the 2010 remake is as bad as most people say it is. It's a poor movie overall, but it had some good things in it like the darker tone, Jackie Earle Haley's performance, the micro naps idea, and the score (Which I think is better than the original film's score actually).

I have hope that this new remake could be awesome. I like the writer they hired who wrote Orphan and there has been a recent horror movie resurgence.

I'm not saying this new remake will be good, but I think it has the potential to. We'll have to wait and see who they hire to direct the film and who they get to play the new Freddy.

What do you think?"
3,"When Does The Review Embargo For The Dark Tower Lift? I can't wait to see this movie (One of my most anticipated of the year). But since it comes out next week, I'm trying to find out when the reviews will be out. So far I can't find anything. I know Sony will be having early screenings of the film, but it doesn't say when the reviews are allowed to be published. I really hope Sony doesn't wait until the last minute to allow the reactions to be released.

What do you think and do you know when The Dark Tower reviews will be online? Thanks."
3,"Hopes/Expectations For The New Tomb Raider Film Next Year? I'm excited to see it. I want more great adventure films. While the Angalena Jolie film was silly and fun, I'm happy that this new film is going for a more serious tone. And the casting of Alicia Vakander as Laura Croft is brilliant. I'm also curious to see what director Roar Uthog can do with this film. I've watched some of his most recent film The Wave and I'm happy that he's making his first American film with Tomb Raider.

I know that the video game adaptation curse hasn't quite been broken yet (Even though I enjoyed Warcraft and Assassin's Creed and Castlevania so far), but I still think this could be a really fun origin story.

What do you think?"
3,"My Thoughts On The Latest Movie/TV News This is something new I'm trying to do where I give my thoughts on some of the big recent entertainment news stories.

War For The Planet Of The Apes Review/Thoughts- I finally got to see Apes a couple of days ago. It's been my most anticipated film of the summer because of how much I love the last two films in the series. So did it live up to the hype? 

No it exceeded it. So far, this might be my favorite film of the year (It's between this, Logan, and Patriot's Day). 

This is what a summer blockbuster should be. Yes it has great action and outstanding visual effects, but those aren't the first things you want to talk about. It's the story, characters, and the acting. I really hope Andy Serkis get's an Oscar Nomination next year (If Fox tries to push him for one, it should be for best lead actor this time please). He's always been great as Caeser, but in this film, we get to see a new side of the character motivated by revenge and it's believable because of Serkis. 

Woody Harleson is also fantastic as The Colonel. He's truly menacing and has a lot of charisma, but he isn't just a mustache twirling villain. Without getting into spoilers. there's a scene where he is having a conversation with Caeser and he reveals why he's the way he is. And what he's done is horrible, but at the same time you understand why he did it. 

All of the other performances are great too with Steve Zhan as Bad Ape and the actress who plays Nova all being major standouts. I was also really happy to see Maurice have a bigger role in this film. I've always liked him in these films and his bond with Caeser. 

Without spoilers, I thought this movie ended perfectly. It ends this trilogy about Caeser, but at the same time, it does leave the door open for future films.

Overall, War For The Planet Of The Apes is a triumph. I don't have any major issues with it. It's one of the best blockbusters ever made and a fitting conclusion to the trilogy.

5/5 

The Snowman Trailer- Yesterday, the first trailer for the Michael Fassbender murder mystery film, The Snowman, dropped. This trailer really surprised me. I thought it looked really creepy and suspenseful, Fassbender and the rest of the cast look great (Is it just me, or does it look like Fassbender's character wants to kill The Snowman himself?), and it's a pretty cool (No pun intended) concept for a film.

The Disaster Artist Teaser- Wow this looks amazing. The Room is one of the best worst films ever made and when you watch it you think ""How did this happen?"". Well now we have a movie about the making of this fine piece of cinema. The whole teaser is James Franco as Tommy Weisu trying to remember his lines for the infamous rooftop scene and him having to shoot that scene over 65 times, and was laughing every time that happened. James Franco looks great as Tommy and it will be interesting to see him interact with Greg/Mark (Played by Dave Franco) in this film.

Venom/Silver And Black Updates- Sony recently revealed new details for the upcoming Spider-Man spin offs Venom and Silver And Black. Venom is going to be a sci fi horror film inspired by David Cronenberg and John Carpenter films, and Silver And Black will be a buddy film about two very damaged women. Now I know a lot of people are against Sony making these movies and not having them be connected to the MCU and I used to feel that way too, but after the news about what tones of these movies are will be and that Tom Hardy is involved, I can't help but be excited. 

Kingsman 2 trailer- Fox just dropped a new trailer for Kingsman The Golden Circle for Comic Con. And it was fine. I liked it, but didn't love it. I have no doubt that the movie will be a lot of fun, but for me, something was missing from this trailer and I think it was a natural flow. I really liked the way it started, but after that it just became a selection of random scenes to me.

Star Vs The Forces Of Evil Returning This November- Disney recently aired the season 3 premiere of Star Vs The Forces Of Evil, The Battle For Mewni, last weekend. But fans of the show (Like myself), will have to wait a little while for the rest of season. After a live in character chat with Eden Sher and Adam McArthur as Star and Marco, a very short teaser for the rest of the season was shown and confirmed that the series won't be back until November. That's strange to me since one of the storyboard artists said it would return in September. I was disappointed by this news considering we just got TBFM. I hope we get some more news about this during Comic Con.

New Poster For IT- Warner Bros recently released a new poster for the upcoming IT film. I find the poster to be ""eh"". It's a cool idea for a poster, but it looks very photoshopped. I just hope WB releases the new trailer they showed at Comic Con soon.

The Dark Tower Too Short?- It's recently been confirmed by Stephen King and director Nikolaj Arcel that the upcoming adaptation of the Dark Tower books will only be 95 minutes long. I'll admit, when I first heard about about this, I was surprised because most of the time these type of films are 2/two and a half hours long. But I don't think this is bad news for the film like a lot of people think. There have been plenty of great movies that have been under 2 hours and plenty of terrible movies over 2 hours. How long or short a movie is doesn't tell you how good or bad a film will be. Dark Tower will be great or terrible and it won't be because of the runtime."
3,"Looking Back On The Sam Raimi Spider-Man Trilogy (2002-2007) t's hard to believe that the original Spider-Man film series ended 10 years ago. I feel really old now.

Spider-Man- I grew up with the first Spider-Man movie. I first watched it for the first time when I was like 2 years old and it made me a huge fan of the character. Rewatching it now, it is kind of dated and cheesy at times, but I still think it's a well done superhero movie and proved that the first X-Men film wasn't a fluke. Toby Maguire was great as Peter Parker and very good as Spidey (Although I felt he could've been a bit more humorous), and while the Green Goblin suit looks really stupid and Power Ranger like, William Dafoe crushed it as Norman Osborn and you can tell he's having a blast playing this character. And of course, the big stand out is J.K. Simmons as J Jonah Jamason. So many great lines. Please bring him back in future Spidey films. The only casting I felt didn't work was Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Dunst is a good actress, but she isn't Mary Jane and has little chemistry with Maguire. The origin story is told really well (Uncle Ben's death is heartbreaking), and the final fight is actually pretty brutal and awesome.

Spider-Man 2- A rare example where the sequel is better than the first movie. This was the first film I saw in theaters and I've loved it ever since. And I do think it is the best Spider-Man movie ever made (Sorry Homecoming, you're overrated). The storyline is fantastic with Peter struggling about weather or not he wants to be Spider-Man and how being both Peter and Spidey affects his life and relationships with his friends. And my god, Alfred Molina is absolutely magnificent as Doc Ock. He's the best villain in the Spider-Man movies so far because he's not just a mustache twirling villain. He's a man who lost the love of his life because of his own experiment and it causes the arms to manipulate him. And  the action scene are so much better than the first film. Especially that awesome train fight. This movie is 13 old and that fight still holds up.

Spider-Man 3- I know I've posted about this before, but for this post I'll do it again. When I first saw this movie as a little kid, I loved it and saw it 3 times in the theater with my family. However, as I got into my teenage years, I realized that this movie is very flawed. Unlike the first 2 films, the narrative is very sloppy, there's too many storylines and some unneeded characters like Gwen Stacy, they rushed and ruined Venom (My favorite Spider-Man villain. Hope that Tom Hardy crushes it), Toby Maguire overacts in the film and cries a lot, there's too many Mary Jane complaining about her acting career scenes, and of course they turn Peter Parker into an emo dancer. But there are some really good things in the film as well like Thomas Haden Church's performance as Flint Marko and his storyline (Plus The Birth Of Sandman scene is beautiful. One of the best scenes in a superhero movie), most of the action looks really good, I liked the New Goblin story (Even though his glider looks really stupid) and Harry's redemption at the end, teaming up with Peter to defeat Venom and Sandman, J.K. Simmons's scenes, and the scenes where the symbiote crawls onto Peter and when he removes the suit.

3,"The Dark Tower Box Office Predictions? I think this movie will be a surprise hit. The budget is only like 60 million dollars (Which is good to hear. Not every movie needs to cost 100 million bucks and I wish more studios would listen to that) and I heard that the film was tracking to make 42 million domestically on it's opening weekend. That's pretty good. Plus, the film is based on a beloved book series that many people have been waiting for. And it doesn't have any major competition in August, Spider-Man and Apes will have already been out for a few weeks, and while Dunkirk and Atomic Blonde will most likely be box office hits, they won't make the same type of numbers as other summer movies do.

3,"Do We Bash Sony Pictures Too Much? Look, I know Sony has put out several bad films and has thought of some stupid ideas before. But I think because of that, we forget that Sony can put out good/great films of different genres. 

Sony most profitable franchise is obviously Spider-Man. And for the last couple of years, I've noticed people have been saying that all Sony does is screw up Spidey. That isn't true. Yes they screwed up Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man 2, but they also gave us Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2 (Considered to be one of the greatest comic book movies of all time), and The Amazing Spider-Man. All good/great films that critics and fans enjoyed. Plus, many Spider-Man fans consider The Spectacular Spider-Man cartoon to be the greatest adaptation of the webhead. You know which studio made that show? Sony did.

And outside of Spider-Man, Sony can put out good movies. Here are some examples.

Men In Black, The Fifth Element, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, Whiplash, 21/22 Jump Street, the original Ghostbusters, the original Total Recall, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs 1 and 2, Moon, District 9, Life, The Magnificent Seven, Zombieland, Moon, This Is The End, Step Brothers, Superbad, The Other Guys, Talledega Nights, The Social Network, Goosebumps, Casino Royale, Skyfall, Captain Phillips, and most recently, Baby Driver.

Once again, I'm not saying that Sony is a perfect company and that we shouldn't bash them when they screw up. They've but out bad films and have made mistakes,but every studio does (Even Disney).

What do you think?"
3,"2018 Is A Big Year For Tom Hardy Mr. Hardy has three major projects next year.

Taboo Season 2. I quite enjoyed Taboo Season 1. I felt that it was a little disjointed and slow at times, but the story, score, sets, and Hardy's performance were very strong. And the finale set up season 2 very well.

Fonzo. I think this is a project that film fans should pay attention to. A movie about the final days of Al Capone starring one of the best actors working today and being directed by the guy who made Chronicle. Not only could this be Josh Trank's comeback, this is also the type of film that could potentially get Hardy another Oscar nomination.

Venom. When Sony announced that they were making a stand alone Venom movie that's possibly separate from the MCU, a lot of people were upset. But after they announced that Hardy would play Eddie Brock, I've noticed people are a bit more interested in the project. Not just because Tom Hardy is a great actor, but because of how picky he is known to be about the movies he stars in.

What are your thoughts. "
3,"What Are Some Of The Best Blockbusters Of The 2010's Decade? Here are my picks.

Inception. What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? Brilliant movie and the rare type of summer blockbuster that makes you think and forces you to pay attention to everything.

Edge Of Tomorrow. I think this is a movie that deserves more attention than it got in theaters. Because of horrible trailers, EOT didn't have great box office results, but the film was great. Tom Cruise actually plays a coward in the movie How often do you get to see that?  And it proves that manga/anime adaptations can work.

The Avengers. In my personal opinion, this is the greatest comic book movie ever made. As a fun popcorn superhero film, it's awesome. Great chemistry between the heroes, amazing action scenes and special effects, and one of the best comic book movie villains in Loki.

Rise And Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes. Rise surprised all of us with how good it was. The trailers were horrible and made the film look like mindless ape action, but it was more than that. It was a great character study of Ceaser and a very emotional film. And when Dawn came out, it became a rare example where the sequel is better than than the first film. Can't wait to see War. 

Logan. A brilliant character study of Logan/Wolverine with amazing performances from Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Dafne Keen combined with a western like tone.

What are your picks? Comment and let me know. Thanks for reading."
3,"What Is The Most Disappointing Blockbuster Of The 2010's Decade So Far? I have two picks.

The Last Airbender (2010). I'll admit, I had never seen the animated series before the film came out (I still need to catch up on it). But I thought the trailer for Airbender looked awesome and I thought premise sounded very promising. I didn't see it in theaters, but I watched it with my grandma on Netflix and after about 40 minutes of watching it, we agreed to turn it off. I eventually saw the rest of the movie on TV and absolutely hated it. I honestly think it belongs in the top 5 worst movies of all time. And what makes so disappointing is that the trailers were truly great.

Fantastic Four (2015). I remember about a year and a half before this movie came out thinking ""I've never seen such venomous hatred of a film that hasn't been released yet"". Whenever news about the film came out or whenever people talked about it, almost everyone was saying that the movie would suck and blow hard. And I was someone defending it. I had a lot of faith in Fantastic 4 because Josh Trank directed Chronicle, Simon Kinberg was coming off of X-Men DOFP, the cast was great, Fox was getting better with their comic book movies with X-Men and Kingsman, and the trailers were great. I actually thought F4 was going to be the best comic book movie of 2015. Wow was I wrong. I was so disappointed. The first act showed potential for a good sci fi film and I actually enjoyed it, but after that, the movie becomes a mess, you can tell that the studio took over the film, and the final battle is horrible.

I didn't mention Batman V Superman because I've grown to like it more every time I watch it."
3,"About The Amy Pascal And Kevin Feige Venom Interview Ever since that interview where Pascal said that the upcoming Venom movie would be tied to Spider-Man Homecoming, many fans have wondered if she's actually telling the truth. They point out that while she was answering the question, Feige had this awkward and shocked look on his face. They believe that Pascal is lying about this.

I don't believe that. First of all, that's an incredibly moronic thing to do. And second, if she was lying, I'm pretty sure Marvel would've released a statement to clear things up. My suspicion is that the reason Feige had that strange look on his face is because they were intending on announcing Venom and Silver And Black being part of MCU and tied to Homecoming at a big event like D23 or San Diego Comic Con, but Pascal spilled the beans a little early.

What do you think?"
3,"Venom/Sinister Six Movie Theory We know that Sony is planning their own Marvel Universe that will start with next year's Tom Hardy lead Venom movie and will continue with Silver And Black in 2019. But what else could they be planning? There have been rumors that Sony still wants to make a Sinister Six film, but how can you make a Sinister Six film without Spider-Man being a key part of the film?

Here's a crazy theory. I remember during an episode of Collider Movie Talk a couple of months ago, the crew answered a question about Sony possibly making a Sinister Six film outside of the MCU and John Campea suggested that if they did, Venom would probably be the reason the team comes together instead of Spidey. This got me thinking ""Could Sony actually do this?"". And I'm starting to think they will.

I believe that Spider-Man will exist in Sony's new universe somehow, but he won't be a main character. I think that Venom will probably be the focus of this universe because of the character's popularity and Tom Hardy's casting. And Venom needs more villains to fight after Carnage. Why not The Sinister Six? Plus, with Marvel not wanting to focus on villains from the previous Spider-Man films, this could be Sony's chance to give us new takes on guys like Sandman, Doc Ock, and Lizard and redeem some other villains like Electro and Rhino. And with Kraven rumored to be the villain of Silver And Black, maybe that could set up him being a member of The Sinister Six.

What I think will happen is that I think some of these villains will be introduced in Venom, Silver And Black, and Venom 2 and then you will get to see a team up movie where The Sinister Six team up to fight Venom, Black Cat, and Silver Sable. And if that works, then Sony can finally make their Sinister Six film and maybe make it a better version of Suicide Squad.

What do you guys think of this theory? Do you think it's possible, or is it too insane? I know it would be a major change from the comics, but I would actually be okay with it if it's handled well. The most important thing is to make a good movie, not to be 100% true to the comics.

Thanks."
3,"What Are Your Top 3 Most Anticipated Films For The Rest Of The Summer? Here are my picks.

1. War For The Planet Of The Apes- War has begun! I've loved the last two Apes films (Rise and Dawn). I think they are some of the best summer blockbusters in the last 10 years. They aren't mindless action movies. They are great stories. And Dawn was a rare example were the sequel was better than the first film. And I have a lot of faith in this third film. Matt Reeves is coming back to direct, the trailers have been incredible, the last 2 films were great, and the fact that Fox delayed the film to give Reeves more time to finish the story tells me that they aren't just rushing this film to make more money. I have almost zero doubt that this movie will be great.

2. Star Vs The Forces Of Evil. The Battle For Mewni- I know this might not fully qualify as a summer movie considering it won't be in theaters, but it's airing as a 2 hour movie and I'm very excited. I'm a big fan of Star Vs. It's a really fun and creative show with cute characters, great voice acting, and an engaging world (Or maybe I should say worlds). The season 2 finale was great and heartbreaking and I can't wait to see how this movie addresses that season 2 ending.

3. The Dark Tower- Full disclosure. I haven't read the books, so I can't judge how accurate the trailers are to the books. But I don't think that really matters because this isn't a book, it's a movie. And I think it looks and sounds like an awesome sci fi western. Also, it's great to see Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in a movie together as a Gunslinger and an evil sorcerer.

Honorable Mentions. Dunkirk and Baby Driver.

I would've had Spider-Man Homecoming on this list months ago, but after seeing the trailers and hearing about some of the plot details, I've lost a lot of my hope for the film. And as a huge Spider-Man fan, that upsets me.

What are your picks?"
3,"Why Do Some People Make Fun Of Others For Having An Opposite Opinion On Movies? I've never understood this. Movies are art and when people look at a piece of art like a painting or a drawing, they will see different things and have different opinions on it. It doesn't mean they are right or wrong about it, it's just how they felt.

I've seen a lot of comments on this sub reddit where people make fun of someone for liking a movie that a lot of people panned or disliking a film that is beloved by most. And I believe those people are jerks. Let people have their own opinion and don't make insult them them for that. I don't like the original Halloween, Fences, or the Northwest Mansion Mystery Gravity Falls episode and I like the Batman V Superman Ultimate Edition, Assassin's Creed, and Chappie. Am I gonna tell others that they are wrong if they disagree? Of course not because I respect different opinions. And I'm sure those jerks have different opinions about movies as well.

What do you think?"
3,"Should We Have Hope For The 2018 Venom Movie? When they first announced this version of the Venom film back in March of 2016, like many people I was upset that it wouldn't be connected to Marvel or possibly Spider-Man at all. I thought it sounded like a stupid and horrible idea. Then we didn't hear anything about the project for over a year until a few months ago when Sony announced a 2018 release date for the project. And once more news about the project started coming out about the film like the sci fi horror tone and the casting of Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, I got more excited about the film, to the point where I'm more excited for this film than Homecoming.

I've noticed that despite some good news about the project, fans are still upset that this film is getting made. Here are some reasons why I think we should have hope for the Venom movie.

1. Venom is a great character (My favorite supervillain), deserves a solo film, and needs to be redeemed after Spider-Man 3 screwed him up. Some people view Venom as a mindless killing machine, but he's not. He's very complex and has been both a villain and an anti hero. And a lot of people think you can't tell a solo Venom story without Spider-Man. I think you can. In the comics, Venom has become more of a solo character.

2. Tom Hardy is involved with the film. This has excited a lot of people because Hardy is not only a great actor, he's known to be extremely picky about the roles he takes. He won't just accept any random movie you offer him. And if you look at his filmography, there aren't a lot of stinkers. So if someone like Hardy signed up to be part of a big universe (Not just a solo film), that's a good sign.

3. It will be an R rated sci fi horror film. That's perfect for something like Venom. I don't think every comic book movie needs to be rated R, but Venom is one that I think could benefit from an R rating with him probably being an anti hero and killing the bad guys who are scared of him.

4. Carnage. A lot of us have always wanted to see Carnage and Venom fight each other on the big screen. And if you want to do Carnage right, he has to be R rated (Something Marvel won't allow).

5. The director is Rubian Fiesher and the writer are Scott Rosenbum and Jeff Pinkner. Zombieland proves Fiesher has talent. Yes, he also directed Gangster Squad, but I blame the script more than his direction and I know they changed some stuff after the Aurora shooting. And with the writers, considering that they are writing other upcoming Sony films like The Dark Tower and Jumanji and Sony has given Venom to them, that's says something about what they think of those writers.

6. People like to crap on Sony for a lot of the bad movies they but out and some weird ideas they have. But don't forget, they can put out good movies too like District 9, Zombieland, Step Brothers, Talladega Nights, The Social Network, Men In Black, Moon, 21/22 Jump Street, The Night Before, Casino Royale/Skyfall, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs, Life, The Magnificent Seven, Hotel Transylvania, Whiplash, etc. And while they screwed up Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man 2, they have done a good job with the Spider-Man mythos overall. They gave us Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, The Amazing Spider-Man, and The Spectacular Spider-Man cartoon. And a lot of us are excited about some of their upcoming films like Baby Driver, The Dark Tower, He-Man, and Uncharted.

7. A lot of people are upset that Spider-Man may not be part of this universe (I actually like the fact that this will not be part of the MCU. Not everything needs to be connected guys). But to be fair, Sony has never actually said that. What I think will happen is Spider-Man will be alluded to in the film and there will be flashbacks to Venom's origin at the church.

I'm not guaranteeing that Venom will be a great movie. It could suck. But I think there are a lot of reasons for us to be hopeful about the film.

What do you think? Agree or disagree? Thanks."
3,"Could Valerian And The City Of A Thousand Planets Be Summer's Biggest Flop? I think it's a high possibility (Regardless of quality) for a number of reasons.

1. The trailers have not impressed most people. They feel more style over substance and have a little Jupiter Ascending vibe.

2. While Luc Besson is a good director and has made great movies like The Fifth Element and Leon The Professional, he's coming off of Lucy, which really sucked. It was an action movie with an invincible god and no tension.

3. No one has heard of Valerian. I know it helped George Lucas make Star Wars, but most people who aren't comic or movie nerds don't know that.

4. While I think Dane Dahaan is a great actor and will have a huge career soon, he and Cara Delevine are not big A list stars that will get the general audience to pay to see the film.

5. It comes out in July, the same month Spider-Man Homecoming and War For The Planet Of The Apes come out and the same day Dunkirk is released. Has a lot of competition to deal with.

6. I've heard that the budget is close to 200 million. That's a huge risk. I can't see the movie making it's money back if the budget is that big (At least not in America).

So yeah, I think Valerian will probably end up being the biggest bomb of the summer (Even bigger than King Arthur). I hope I'm wrong. I hope the movie is fun and is a hit, but I think it will crash and burn."
3,"Just Looked At Producer Frank Marshall's Filmography Wow. This guy has produced some of the greatest and most iconic films of all time.

The Original Indiana Jones Trilogy.

Cape Fear. 

The Back To The Future Films.

Signs.

The Bourne Trilogy.

Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

Jurassic World (I thought it was fun).

Arachnophobia 

The BFG.

That's an impressive filmography. I think he's one of the greatest producers of all time. Yes, he also produced films like The Last Airbender and Crystal Skull (I liked Assassin's Creed though). But everyone has some stinkers.

What are your guy's thoughts on Mr Marshall?"
3,"What Are Some Recently Released Films That You Thought Critics Were Too Hard On? Here are my picks.

1. Batman V Superman Dawn Of Justice. This was my most anticipated film for last few years (Even more than Civil War and Star Wars). When I first saw the movie, I was disappointed. I didn't hate it and thought it had some really good stuff, but wasn't put together very well and it felt like a lot had been removed. A few months later, I saw The Ultimate Edition and while it's not a great film and still has script issues, it fixed some of my big issues with the film (Pacing, editing, story flow). But while the Ultimate Edition is considered an improvement over the theatrical cut, there are a lot of people who still hate this movie and treat it like it's the worst comic book movie. I disagree. There are some great things in this movie like Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman, the cinematography, the actual plot, the action including the big BVS fight, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, and a lot of really great scenes. I don't think this movie deserves a 27% on RT. I would give it a 65%.

2. Assassin's Creed. I had a lot of hopes that this would be the first great video game movie after Warcraft turned out to be just okay. You have Michael Fassbender starring in and producing the film, Justin Kurzel directing it, a great supporting cast, and great source material. I saw the movie after reading/watching the bad reviews and I was waiting for it to be horrible. And I never got that. Yes, the movie has some really bad stuff in it (The I'm Crazy scene, Marion C phoning it in, not enough time in the past, not going into more of Cal's backstory, etc). But I don't think this movie deserves to be considered complete garbage since there are some really cool things in the film. Michael Fassbender gives a great and committed performance, the scenes in the past are really interesting and have great lore, the film is shot well, the musical score in fantastic, the sets are terrific, the Maria assassin character was interesting, etc. And I think it's one of the better video game movies especially in terms of acting and production value.

3. The Great Wall. Going in to this movie, I expected it to completely suck and blow. And for the first 5 minutes I got that, but it did get a bit better when they actually got to The Great Wall. While Matt Damon's character is very boring, I liked the main female in the film and her arc and a lot of the battle scenes. It's not a great movie, but it was better than I thought.

3,"Thor Ragnarok And Justice League Both Come Out This November. Which Film Are You More Excited For? This will be a really interesting November. I'm really excited for both films. But if I could only see one of them, I will take Justice League because while Thor 3 looks awesome and I'm sure it will be a lot of fun, I've been waiting for a Justice League movie for years. I never thought we would get two Avengers films and two Guardians Of The Galaxy films before we got a Justice League film. Yes, I know that Batman V Superman disappointed a lot of us (I still like The Ultimate Edition though), but I still believe Justice League can be great. Zack Snyder has made good movies, Chris Terrio did write the Oscar Winning Argo, Ben Affleck is Batman and a hands on producer, the trailers have been great so far, and the fact that WB thinks this can compete with Thor gives me a lot of hope for this movie.

Which movie are you more excited for and why? Thanks."
3,"What Are The Top Five Worst Comic Book Movies? Here are my picks?

1. Superman 4 The Quest For Peace (1987). I hate this movie so much. This is in my top 5 worst movies of all time. Nothing in this movie works. The CGI is some of the worst I've ever seen, there's crazy timejumps, the government is okay with Superman throwing nuclear weapons into the sun, they use that same Superman flying shot like 10 times, and Nuclear Man is a real villain. The worst movie villain ever.

2. Catwoman (2004). This wasn't a Catwoman movie. It's a movie about Egyptian gods, cats, and the evil people involved making make up with horrible CGI.

3. Batman And Robin (1997). A 2 hour long toy commercial with neon lights, ice puns, rubber bat nipples, too many villains, a whiny sidekick, and ""Bombs!"". This movie was so bad that it not only killed the Batman franchise for awhile, it killed comic book movies until X-Men came out.

4. Steel (1997). This is a 90's superhero movie starring Shaquille O'Neal wearing a ""steel"" costume that's really made of plastic and rubber and villains who sell illegal weapons on a website. Do I need to say anymore?

5. Captain America (1990). We all love Captain America today because of the MCU. But many people viewed him as a joke because of this trainwreck. This movie actually has a Red Skull (A Nazi) with an Italian accent. 

What are your picks?"
3,"Since Uncharted Begins Filming This Year, When Will Sony Announce Who's Playing Nathan Drake? My guess original guess was at E3, but then I remembered that Naughty Dog has said that they aren't involved in the movie (Good news in my opinion because they aren't a film studio). So now, I think Sony will announce it at Comic Con this year. I think they will announce the actor playing Drake, a plot synopsis, a shooting start date, and a new release date.

If I was casting Drake, I would cast About Alex, Parenthood, and Gravity Falls star Jason Ritter. I think he's one of the most underrated actors working today and I would love for him to get the lead role in a potential franchise film. And I could see him playing a likable thief.

I have hopes for this film. Maybe it can be the first beloved video game movie. Yes, we all thought the same thing about Warcraft and Assassin's Creed (I kind of liked them), but I think Uncharted has better cinematic potential than those other games simply because of the lead character. Plus, they have the director of Real Steel and the writer of Nark involved. Great news."
3,"What's Your Favorite Trailer Of The Year So Far? Here are my picks.

Justice League. Call me a nerd if you want, but this trailer was awesome. It did what a good trailer should do. Tell us what the movie is about (Parademons are coming and Batman and Wonder Woman have to assemble Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg to form the Justice League), without giving away major spoilers. I loved the way the trailer introduced us to the characters, the action looked fantastic, I loved that line ""What are your powers again?"" ""I'm rich."", and I thought the music fit in really well (I used to not like it, but after watching the trailer more and more, it's grown on me).

IT. While I'm not a horror movie buff, I really like a good scary movie. And this trailer was scary. I think they have nailed Pennywise so far. He really does looks like a demonic, child murdering clown. The kids looked really good, and the best moments were the slideshow scene and the ""You'll float too"" scene. Creepy.

What are your picks?"
3,"My Top 5 Favorite Movies For a long time I couldn't put together a Top 5 best movies list because there are so many great movies to choose from. But after a few weeks of really thinking about it, I've decided what my 5 personal favorite movies (In no particular order) are. 

1. The Shawshank Redemption. Best prison movie of all time for sure. Frank Darabont's direction and writing is fantastic. No scene feels out of place or like a time waster. Morgan Freeman gives probably his best performance as Red and Tim Robbins is fantastic as Andy too (I feel like because Freeman is excellent in the film, we sometimes forget about Robbins). This movie also contains one of the saddest deaths in film (The death of Brooks) and one of the best endings of all time when Andy and Red reunite on that beach years later. Every time I watch this movie, that ending chokes me up.

2. The Avengers. To me this the best superhero movie ever made. As a fun popcorn blockbuster, this movie is a masterpiece. The action is awesome, the CGI is great, the film is funny, Loki is a great, charismatic, and sympathetic villain, and all of The Avengers play off each other really well. But thing I love the most about this movie is the way it's directed. This movie could've easily been a huge mess because you have 6 heroes in one movie. But thank to Joss Whedon's direction and script, all the heroes (Except for maybe Hawkeye) get an almost equal amount of screentime.

3. Jaws. What else is there left to say about Jaws? It's fantastic and it created the summer blockbusters. This really isn't a shark movie, it's really a Chief Brody movie and I love it. Quint and Hooper are also awesome and that scene where they are singing in the boat is just gold.

4. Elf. This is my favorite comedy film and my family Christmas movie. I love how much humor and heart this movie has. This could've just been a full on Will Ferrell comedy, but Jon Faveru added some real nice heart in the film with Buddy's relationship with his dad and him falling in love with Jovie. It also has 2 of my favorite comedy moments in film. The first one being when Buddy shouts ""SANTA! OH MY GOD!"" in the mall and when Buddy assumes Peter Dinklige is one of Santa's elves.

5. The Toy Story Trilogy. Some might disqualify these films because they are animated family films. I think those people are crazy. Good movies are good movies. And the Toy Story trilogy might be favorite trilogy of all time (I still love the Star Wars and Lord Of The Rings films). I love the characters so much. I grew up with Woody and Buzz and the gang. All 3 films have such great emotion and the toys really feel like a true family.

3,"What Is The Sub's Opinion On The Youtube Channel Cinematic Excrement? There are a lot of Youtube channels reviewing bad movies (Chris Stuckmann with his Hilariocity reviews, Doug Walker/Nostalgia Critic, GoodBadFlicks, FanboyFlicks, etc) and a lot of them are very entertaining to watch. But there's one guy doing this who I don't think gets enough credit. A guy named Sean Moore (AKA The Smeghead), who hosts Cinematic Excrement, a hilarious monthly show talking about bad movies and why they are so bad. While I just discovered him this past December, he's been on Youtube since 2009 when his Twilight review/rant was posted

Moore's reviews are funny, but he also has true passion for film and his reviews are pretty deep, get to the point, and explain why those movies are so bad. He also sometimes does Vlogs/reviews about movies playing in theaters now that are pretty good and honest.

In Zootopia, there's a scene where Nick the Fox goes ""Ugh wolves, what's with the howling?"" Weirdly Jason Bateman played a wolf almost 30 years before in Teen Wolf Too.

Somehow I doubt that was intentional on Disney's part though. No one cares about or remembers Teen Wolf Too. I don't even think the cast and crew of Teen Wolf Too, let alone Jason Bateman, really care about Teen Wolf Too. So the probability someone would intentionally reference it in a mainstream Disney film, especially one aimed at a crowd who wasn't born until about 20 years after Teen Wolf Too came out, is completely and utterly low.

Still it is funny to see Jason Bateman go from being a wolf to complaining about them.

Not the only time something similar has happened. In Wild America, Jonathan Taylor Thomas runs into wild animals throughout the whole movie and I know one of them is, for a fact, a lion. What was the only movie JTT was in that was a critical and commercial success again?

Speaking of The Lion King, almost everyone in the remake has made a Lion King reference in their stand up, rap songs, or interviews years before they were in it. Donald Glover even once sang ""I'll be your Simba, you're Nala"". And, in Keanu, which Keegan Michael-Key was in, Tiffany Hadish made a Lion King reference in one scene. Then again The Lion King has such a ubiquitous place in pop culture that it would be hard for them to find actors who've NEVER mentioned the movie in some capacity professionally, especially considering the cast is made up mainly of comedians and pop stars.

And Matthew Broderick went from hearing Meg Ryan compare his ex-girlfriends love life to a Godzilla movie in Addicted to Love to, well, being in THAT movie a year later."
4,"Worst examples of stunt casting in movies I'm gonna say it but James Earl Jones shouldn't have reprised his role as Mufasa in The Lion King remake. He was great back in 1994 but in the 2019 one he just completely mailed in his performance, like he just wanted to get through it and was doing it for a paycheck. Just compare his delivery in the scene where he gives Simba a pep talk in the 1994 one to the 2019 one, he sounds WAY more passionate in the former movie than he does in the latter movie. Plus, yeah, he just sounds too old, he comes off more like Simba's Grandfather (or even Great Grandfather) than his Father, even if he is playing a CGI lion.

They should've just gotten another deep-voiced, majestic sounding actor. Surely Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Haysbert, or Jeffrey Wright would've gladly taken on the job.

And, if they had to bring back people from the original cast, make Rafiki a woman like the Broadway show and have Whoopi Goldberg voice her. Or have Moira Kelly cameo as Nala's Mom. Hell, Tim Allen got JTT back for Last Man Standing, have JTT cameo as one of Timon and Pumbaa's friends, maybe the antelope Simba thought was going to eat him, that would've been cute! If they couldn't do that, have Matthew Broderick cameo as that antelope! Then it would be like Adult Simba talking to Adult Simba! Or do all of these options, go nuts with it!

Also Sean Penn was in The Angry Birds Movie and did nothing but grunt. Not the first time this has happened (George Clooney provided Sparky the Dog's barks on South Park and Elizabeth Taylor played Maggie Simpson only to say ""Daddy"") but the problem is they put his name on the poster. If you wanted people to go ""that character who grunts was Sean Penn this whole time?!"", here's an idea, have him go uncredited. Or at least don't put his name on the poster, the movie already has so many celebrities as is, one less name on the poster isn't going to hurt anyone."
4,"Divisive movies you thought were average Are there any movies people seem to either love or hate but you thought were just average yourself?

Oh where do I begin?

Avatar

Pocahontas

Man of Steel

The Great Gatsby 2013

Alice in Wonderland 2010 (though any fans it did have seem to have moved on years ago and, if anyone remembers it, it seems to be mostly the people who HATE it nowadays)

The Happytime Murders (if it counts as ""divisive"")

Live by Night

All of these movies garnered mixed responses ranging from ""it's awful"" to ""it's not that bad"" to ""it's great"" while I just thought these were all meh movies"
4,"Biggest wastes of potential in a movie Is there anything (casting, writing, music choices, etc.) you wished they did in a movie but didn't?

Here's one: why did the end credits of Guardians of the Galaxy just include the movie's musical score? Throughout the entire movie, they play 70's songs but, after the scene with Baby Groot and Drax, it's just the score over the credits. 

I feel like it would've been great if they played David Bowie's Heroes over the end credits as I feel like the lyrics would encapsulate who the Guardians are (""We can be heroes/Just for one day"", ""And you/you can be mean/And I/I'll drink all the time"", ""We can steal time/Just for one day"", ""We can be heroes, forever and ever"", etc.)

Plus I just think it would fit the style of the movie more than just playing the score. I'll admit, that's one of the things Guardians 2 did better than the first, it kept playing 70's songs, even when the end credits were going on."
4,"Supporting/Minor Acting Performances That Were Really Bad The ""It's Boiling Acid"" Guy and ""Batman...Ehh"" guys from Batman Forever come to mind

Speaking of Batman, so does the ""No More Dead Cops"" guy in The Dark Knight

A bigger role than those two, but still a supporting role, but The Critic Guy from The Greatest Showman. I get that he was supposed to be stuffy and reserved but the actor's interpretation of that was basically just to say his lines without any emotion whatsoever. Jenny Lind and The Dad played similar roles in the plot but at least they put an ounce of emotion in their parts while still coming off as reserved, while this guy just phoned it in.

Speaking of that, the voice actor they dubbed the actor playing Tom Thumb with also gave a really flat voice-over performance: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbOjlcPMhwk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbOjlcPMhwk)"
4,"Hated acting performances you actually like Maybe this is more divisive than actually hated but I actually liked Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance as Scar for the most part. It's a different take on the character, and Irons does give the BETTER performance, but Ejiofor's performance works for what they were going for. Honestly most of the cast was fine. Even Beyonce I could take or leave (her acting has at least slightly improved since the days of Austin Powers and The Pink Panther). What really sucked was how rushed and going through the motions the script felt and how inexpressive the majority of the animals looked, THAT'S what brought it down rather than any of the vocal performances (though James Earl Jones's tired sounding voice didn't help).

And admittedly, while I still thought he was good in the talky scenes, Ejiofor's Be Prepared sucked. Irons wasn't an amazing singer but he at least gave the song some personality, he didn't just talk sing through it.

Again, more divisive than hated, but I actually liked Julianne Moore as Carrie's Mom in the Carrie remake. You're gonna hate me for this but I actually prefer her stressed out, paranoid addict take on the character to Piper Laurie's loony psycho. I'm REALLY in the minority on this but I actually thought she was too much. Moore gave the only great performance in the remake, not helped by the fact that she was surrounded by teenagers who gave mostly flat, monotone performances (Sue and Tommy's actors come to mind): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Pd3bQtXz4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Pd3bQtXz4)"
4,"Beloved celebrities who barely ever appear in good movies Most actors have at least a couple stinkers on their resume (even Daniel-Day Lewis had Nine) but is there any actor/celebrity who is beloved by a majority of the public yet has never appeared in a good movie?

The Lion King 2019 made me realize this: as much as people love Beyonce and John Oliver, they barely ever appear in good movies.

To be fair, Beyonce barely ever acts, she tends to focus more on her music career and public persona than her acting but, when she does, she tends to pick some stinkers to be in. In addition to The Lion King, there's The Pink Panther, Obsessed, and Epic. Sure Dreamgirls had a lot of Oscar buzz and even won a couple Oscars and Cadillac Records was nominated for a few Golden Globes (and, while critics didn't love it, I'd argue Austin Powers in Goldmember has a lot of moments that make it worth it) but that's about it. And even with Dreamgirls, Beyonce was overshadowed by Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy.

John Oliver is also beloved for his HBO show and Daily Show appearances but his film resume leaves something to be desired. He was also in The Love Guru, The Smurfs 1+2, and Wonder Park. And those are his only movies. Not that impressive of a film resume, thankfully his TV resume is a lot better."
4,"Movies you can understand the hatred for but you still enjoy them A Million Ways To Die in the West

Not EVERY joke lands. In fact, there are some jokes that are overexplained or badly timed. And, if you look further past whether or not it's funny, the ""plot"" such as it is is basically two plots stitched poorly together and Charlize Theron's character is a strong woman that uncharacteristically becomes a damsel in distress at the end despite showing how capable she was of fighting for herself beforehand.

BUT when the movie was funny, it was very funny. There were many times I was laughing out loud at this movie and, while I could see the movie's flaws, I ended up having a fun time because of it."
4,"Popular movies that were fads Every. single. live. action. Disney. remake.

Most of them make huge amounts of money at the box office then no one really talks about them until the NEXT Disney remake comes up and people talk about them again. Even Cinderella and The Jungle Book, the ""good ones"", are really only talked about whenever one of these comes up, someone complains about these remakes, and then someone else goes ""Well Cinderella and Jungle Book were good but the rest of them suck"".

Same thing goes for the Pixar sequels. Except for Toy Story 2 and 3, none of the sequels have had much pop culture impact. The Cars sequels, Monsters University, Incredibles 2, and Finding Dory were all huge hits at the box office, with Dory and Incredibles 2 even raking in a billion dollars, yet do people still talk about them? I haven't really heard people mention them in years (or, in Incredibles 2's case, for months). Meanwhile, there's been plenty of times I've at least seen Monsters, inc. and Finding Nemo referenced years after both movies came out. And Cars definitely sells a lot of merch. But, really, even Toy Story 4 seems to be quietly fading in obscurity while still raking in a billion dollars.

And I've said it before but Zootopia...in most of the world. It's huge in Asia, even getting it's own land in Shanghai, but despite grossing a billion dollars, getting a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and winning the Oscar for Best Animated Film, people in the rest of the world have hardly talked about it as much as other popular, critically acclaimed, high grossing Disney/Pixar movies. When it comes to popularity, it's no Frozen. In fact, it's not even Moana or Finding Nemo for that matter.

And, before anyone else says it, Avatar."
4,"Recast a movie if it came out in its original decade but had a different cast Basically, instead of doing a recast of a movie if it had a remake nowadays, cast a movie if it came out in the same year, or at least decade, just with different people in the roles. I'll start with a movie that's getting a remake this week:

The Lion King (1994)

Adult Simba-John Cusack or Brendan Fraser (who looks like a human version of Simba)

Cub Simba-Macaulay Culkin

Adult Nala-Halle Berry

Cub Nala-Tatyana Ali

Mufasa-Michael Dorn

Scar-Anthony Hopkins

Rafiki-Morgan Freeman or Joseph Marcell

Zazu-Rik Mayall

Timon-Denis Leary or Adam Sandler

Pumbaa-Gilbert Gottfried

Shenzi-Jenifer Lewis

Banzai-John Leguizamo

Sarabi-Margaret Avery"
4,"Box office hits that destroyed people's careers Usually it's a flop that destroys someone's career not a hit. Can you think of any exceptions?

Alice in Wonderland 2010. Burton and Depp have been in or made a lot of wide, studio released movies since that one but almost all of them have flopped. At least Depp has been in some hits since like Pirates of the Carribean 4&5, Rango, 21 Jump Street, Into the Woods, Black Mass (kinda), Fantastic Beasts 1, and Murder on the Orient Express. Burton hasn't had one hit since Alice in Wonderland. No matter what he does the movie flops or underperforms at the box office nowadays. Even when critics are like ""No, the movie's actually good"" like they did with Frankenweenie and Big Eyes, no one came. Even Dumbo couldn't turn things around. Dumbo! It seems like Alice in Wonderland pretty much killed any goodwill Burton had with people and they haven't seen a movie of his since. He could make the next Citizen Kane and, nowadays, people wouldn't come."
4,"Ugly looking movies that were successful at the box office The. The. The. The GRINCH! (The Jim Carrey version)

The set design and costumes are mostly good and Jim Carrey's makeup is amazing but the movie is filmed with dutch angles all the time and the photography looks like the camera was rubbed with vaseline lenses, it makes the movie pretty damn ugly to look at. And The Who's look creepy. It even went to the point that they didn't even try to make Taylor Momsen look like a who, they just put a wacky haircut on her and put her in a weird costume, just so she'd look cute because, if they made her look like a who, she would not have been cute.

It also says something that Christine Baranski of all people is the most attractive person there.

Suicide Squad also. The movie is so badly lit, it's hard to see things 90% of the time. It doesn't help that most of the movie takes place at night. And the CGI they put on The Enchantress at the end as well as her minion is pretty atrocious. The makeup is fine I guess.

Some scenes in The Greatest Showman. Most of the movie looks pretty good, it can be colorful and well shot, but whenever it uses CGI, the CGI can get pretty crappy and it brings down the look of the rest of the movie. The CGI animals look like unfinished versions of the animals from The Lion King and Dumbo remakes and good god what did they do to Tom Thumb! They had the actor, even though he was already a dwarf, go on his knees to be even shorter and it just looks so awkward whenever he's ""walking"", you can tell it's not his real legs and that he's walking on his knees while CGI legs have been inserted onto him. Even when he's just standing, his torso looks disconnected from his body."
4,"Directors who were completely wrong for certain films M. Night Shyamalan-The Last Airbender

Even if the only movies he had directed beforehand were The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, he still would've been an odd fit. He's known for small thrillers with low budgets, what exactly about that shouts ""Director of a big budget fantasy family adventure""?

Sure directors can do different genres but it's pretty clear he's stuck in his ways. His movies usually have deadpan acting, dark lighting, and a slow pace, and The Last Airbender has all three of those things, which just doesn't work for the kind of movie people were expecting. Add that to the fact that he completely jumped the shark as a director and made so many stinkers that his last film was The Happening and, looking back, it's not that much of a surprise that the movie sucked. Annoying, yes, especially for fans of the show, but not really that surprising all things considered. Plus the CGI is poorly integrated into the movie and its poorly shot, which probably is due to the fact that he just wasn't comfortable directing big budget fantasy movies like this and smaller movies like The Visit or Split were more in his wheelhouse.

Same thing was true of After Earth. It was supposed to be a big budget fantasy family adventure but had all those things and people just did not like it because it was supposed to be fun but Shyamalan just doesn't make fun movies, it's not really his thing."
4,"Sequels that had better production values than their predecessors The Amazing Spider-Man franchise as a whole is pointless, especially considering we now have 3 Spider-Man franchises, the MCU one, the Spider-Verse one, and the Venom one going back to back. That makes 4 Spider-Man franchises in a decade! Jesus!

However, the first Amazing Spider-Man was okay while the second one sucked in most categories...except for cinematography. The cinematography in the first Amazing Spider-Man was dull as shit, it was mostly blacks and greys and plain colors. However the second one was a lot more colorful and it just felt like there was a bigger scope to it, especially during the action scenes. It's basically the one thing the second Amazing Spider-Man got right over the first one. The other element that was better was that it gave Sally Field a bit more screentime and she got one scene to stand out in, which she killed and which makes it sad to me that feels like she didn't have a character to play. Oh well...

Though I wonder if she'd say that if they saw what they were giving Marisa Tomei to do."
4,"Movies that ended careers before they even got started Quvenzhane Wallis...kinda.

She was a rising star thanks for being the youngest Academy Award Nominee for Beasts of the Southern Wild. Then she made Annie 2014, which was a modest box office success but it was blasted by critics and she's hardly acted since. Just one independent film, a bit part in Trolls, and an appearance in a Beyonce music video. That's it. Maybe it's more of a personal choice, I dunno, and I know she joined the cast of Black-ish. Plus she's only 16 so there's definitely a chance that, in the future, she could come back and become a bigger star but, as of now, it seemed like Annie 2014 killed a lot of momentum her career had going for her.

Now that I think about it, are we sure Annie 2014 didn't pretty much kill Cameron Diaz's career? Yes I know Diaz is retired (and also her career had started 20 years before that movie came out) but maybe she just wasn't finding acting fun anymore and the criticism she received for her performance as Hannigan took at least a small part in convincing her to take a break (or even retire altogether). Also Jamie Foxx wasn't in a movie for 3 years after Annie 2014, which is a little weird. Why the 3-year break?

On another note The Last Airbendber and Cowboys & Aliens not only killed Noah Ringer's chances of ever being on the big screen again but seems to have killed his acting career altogether because he hasn't acted in anything since except for some TV show made for his college's TV station, which is a sad drop from being in two big budget blockbusters back to back.

The Last Airbender also seems to have killed Jackson Rathbone's chances of ever appearing in a mainstream movie that's not named Twilight. Well that and Aaron Taylor-Johnson existing."
4,"Controversial movies you dislike for reasons beyond the controversy Are there any movies that were controversial for some reason, stupid or not, that you dislike not because of the controversy surrounding it but because of other reasons?

Not a fan of Captain Marvel but I really don't care what Brie Larson said in an interview. Hell, I'm excited for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, a movie with Emile Hirsch, a man who STRANGLED someone, I'd be a hypocrite if that was the case. And, honestly, I thought it was bullshit how online nerds went from loving the MCU and wanting almost every Marvel character ever to be in it to turning on the MCU just because ONE of their actors said something they didn't like. Yeah way to turn your back and get angry at an entire franchise just because of something one of their actors said, way to just downplay all the hard work everyone else puts into these movies.

Instead, I dislike Captain Marvel because it's boring. The script actually is fine for the most part, except for the plot holes it creates with other MCU movies (Really? That's how Nick Fury lost his eye? And why is he so surprised about aliens in The Avengers if he's met them before?), it's really the presentation that turns me off. Most of the movie takes place in dark rooms so it's dull to look at, the CGI is dodgy for an MCU movie, and it's got a much slower pacing than most MCU movies. The Production Design admittedly is great but it's hard to care when it's lit so poorly. And the actors try their best, I'd say even Brie Larson, but, yeah, the movie was just dull.

Honestly, similar case with Ghostbusters 2016. I don't give a shit what the cast members on social media said or what not, it's just not that funny of a film. Also the whole ""The Government is covering up the Ghosts"" thing was so stupid, I'm honestly surprised more of the haters didn't complain about that sub-plot.

Also Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile. I don't think it really made Bundy out to be a good guy like people were worried it did, him going to jail and even going to the electric chair is portrayed as a good thing by the end of the movie. It's just that they tried to make a mystery out of an event we know already happened so there's just not much there. I know the whole concept is viewing Bundy through the eyes of people who loved him and were shocked to see him commit these crimes but I feel like they could've done that concept without making it a ""mystery"" over whether or not Bundy did something we already know he did. I saw Star 80 recently and I feel like that movie did a better job of the ""famous killer through the eyes of people who knew him"" concept better because even though we see why Roberts' character was appealing to so many people, the movie's like ""yep, he definitely did it"" throughout its entire runtime. I will say, though, that Zac Efron, Lily Collins, and Haely Joel Osment were great!"
4,"Popular characters who were barely in the movie Frank the Pug was only in one scene in Men in Black and yet, somehow, he became popular enough that they gave him a much bigger role in Men in Black II, gave him a supporting role in the TV series, and put him all over the marketing for Men in Black International even though, from what I heard, he's barely in it because the marketers knew that somehow he was recognizable enough to market.

Baby Herman was only in three scenes in Who Framed Roger Rabbit? but he's also in all the spin-off shorts and has appearances in most other Roger Rabbit media including the VHS cover and the Disneyworld ride. And if you reference ""The Baby from Roger Rabbit"" from my experience most people we'll know who you're talking about."
4,"Franchises that end on a low point The Ice Age franchise

The first Ice Age movie was a box office hit and critics liked it fine. The second and third ones received mixed reviews but audiences (mainly kids) still liked them well enough to make them big hits at the box office. The fourth movie was reviewed terribly but it made almost $800 million dollars.

And then the fifth movie got even worse reviews and, even taking into account worldwide box office grosses, had a huge drop in box office grosses ($800 million vs. $408 million). Now it went in an instant from a successful franchise to a franchise Fox is probably not going to be revisiting any time soon. It seems like the 4th one was so bad it basically killed anyone's interest in the series."
4,"Hit movies people tried and failed to capitalize on Almost any follow up to Men in Black is this.

Wild Wild West was basically marketed as ""Western Men in Black minus the aliens"" with Barry Sonnenfeld in the director's  chair, Will Smith starring and doing another theme song, another well known white actor being his co-star, etc. And critics and audiences hated it and it was a box office disappointment.

While Men in Black 2 was a box office hit, critics and audiences also hated it.

Men in Black 3 got decent reviews, though, but box office results were disappointing.

And Men in Black International has outright flopped both critically and commercially.

At least the cartoon was well received...by, like, all 8 people who remember it."
4,"Actors you think should play characters (that other people might not think of) I saw they're considering having Lady Gaga voice Lylla the Otter in Guardians of the Galaxy 3 (if the rumors are true that the character is going to be in it)

Honestly not sure about that. If it's true, I'll give her a chance, it's just that, while Gaga is a decent live action actress, her voice acting in that episode of The Simpsons she was in was pretty weak but maybe she's improved as a voice actress since then, who knows?

But I thought of someone who could do it: Amanda Bynes.

I know that's probably not gonna get any reaction whatsoever but she has a quirky voice that could fit a talking otter and also be good for Guardians (apparently Lylla was a much more serious character in the comics but, come on, so was Rocket so it wouldn't be surprising if they changed that) plus it would be a nice comeback story. A troubled child actress who then gets a comeback in a big Marvel movie of all things, it could be RDJ all over again. Plus she said recently she wants to get back into acting so, if she had been offered the role, she might say yes.

It's definitely not going to happen but it would be cool to see."
4,"Weird little nitpicks you can't help but notice in movies Are there any weird little details that you just can't help but notice in a movie?

Everyone complained about Black Widow not getting a funeral with Tony in Avengers Endgame and, I agree, that was bullshit. But that was actually a pretty significant narrative flaw, I wouldn't call it a nitpick. Gamora not being there is pretty weird, how small of a nitpick it is, though, is debatable. What IS something nitpicky I couldn't help but notice is that, when we see The Guardians, Rocket is standing on a stump. Why is he standing on a stump? Sure he's standing on tables or chairs throughout most of the movie but that's usually when he's talking to or looking at people. But here he's not talking to anyone, he's looking down at the ground, he's not trying to get anyone's attention, why is it necessary for him to stand on a stump? He really has to feel taller than he is at a funeral? Even for Rocket, that seems petty.

Also I'm not sure how small a detail this is but I find it weird how, in The Greatest Showman, the movie films the tall guy when we first meet him in a way that say ""OMG look how tall he is"" and, on the opposite spectrum when it comes to height, is usually filming Charles/Tom/Whatever the dwarf's name is in a way that says ""OMG look how tiny he is""! Now I know the movie is set during a time where most people didn't know about dwarfism or weren't aware that people that tall existed so you could argue the movie was just portraying the normal characters attitudes towards those people's looks. But the movie never really questions or criticizes that attitude, the movie just kinda films them like that and then moves on to the next scene. It ends up feeling like they are actually asking us to be amazed by the existence of dwarfs or extremely tall people despite the fact that, y'know, dwarfs have existed in pop culture for decades now thanks to the likes of Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka, Austin Powers, and a little show called, oh right, Game of Thrones. Or, on the opposite side, there's a little sport called Basketball that frequently hires people around the tall guy's height.

Speaking of dwarfs in movies, it's weird that, in Moulin Rouge, one of the extras is an actual dwarf yet they then hired John Leguizamo to play a dwarf. If they were fine with having an actual dwarf be one of the extras, why didn't they just get another dwarf to play John Leguizamo's part considering the character is supposed to be a dwarf? I know Baz Luhrmann likes reusing actors but was using John Leguizamo again that important to him?"
4,"Movies with cool creatures but boring humans Unfortunately many monster/alien/creature movies are like this.

Two recent examples that come to mind are Pokemon: Detective Pikachu and, say it with me now, Godzilla: King of the Monsters.

Although at least Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmigia, and Millie Bobby Brown still gave good performances. Justice Smith and Kathryn Newton were pretty bad in Detective Pikachu. I hate to say it but they were. Though I feel like it was probably the direction they were given though, as I have heard they've been good in other things. The only thing I have seen Newton in was Three Billboards but she was only in, like, one scene in that movie, it's hard to really judge her overall ability as an actress based on a scene from one movie (though she was good in that scene). But, yeah, their performances were probably less likely due to their overall talent and more likely due to the directors being more focused on bringing the Pokemon to life than they were in getting convincing performances out of their actors.

I will say that, of the human cast, Bill Nighy and Ken Wantanabe were fine but, well, they're Bill Nighy and Ken Wantanabe, those two would probably try to do something good with their performances if they were given a script that was made up only of scribbles. And unfortunately they are barely in the movie and we're stuck with Smith and Newton throughout most of its runtime so it ends up being Ryan Reynolds that has to carry the whole thing. He's clearly having fun doing the role but it would've been nice if he got some support from the two other leads, that's all I'm saying..."
4,"Actors who had big careers earlier this decade yet have fallen off the map recently Any actors you can think of that were huge stars earlier this decade (around 2010-2015) but they seem to have just stopped being in movies recently?

Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jason Segel

Both were headlining major motion pictures from around 2010-2016 yet, starting in 2015, Segel has only done independent films and Levitt hasn't starred in a movie since Snowden. His last big gig was a quick cameo in The Last Jedi.

I think I heard somewhere that Segel now prefers to do independent movies but what happened to Levitt? Did The Walk and Snowden kill his career? 

Also, Jennifer Aniston was starring in major Hollywood films when she was way past 40...until 2017. Nowadays she just does independent and streaming films and is doing a streaming show called The Morning Show. Again, what happened? Was Hollywood like ""Okay, we'll let you be in movies in your 40's but your 50's?! Sorry, that's too much!"""
4,"Movie scenes that became uncomfortable to watch not too long after the movie's release Any scenes you can think of that just feel UNCOMFORTABLE because it reminds you of something that happened in real life not too long after the movie came out?

The Secret Life of Pets has Louis C.K.'s character dancing with hot dogs: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl5GVViqvjo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl5GVViqvjo)

Yeah a kids movie has Louis C.K. dancing with his weenie(s). And to make things even weirder, it came out only a year before we found out what other things Louis likes to do with his weenie.

There was also a scene in that movie he made the year his career ended, I Love You Daddy, that had Charlie Day pretending to masturbate while Edie Falco was in the room but, unlike Secret Life of Pets, no doubt that was intentional on C.K.'s part. I mean C.K. just did SLOP for the paycheck, I Love You Daddy was his true passion project, no doubt he was referencing what he was doing in real life in that scene.

Other examples?

In Godzilla '98, there's a line where Harry Shearer's character says Godzilla coming is ""the worst disaster since The World Trade Center bombing"" which, JESUS, is that an unfortunate line considering what happened only 3 years after its release.

Not an example many people might recognize but, in the internet movie Jesus, Bro, the character the actress Allison Pregler plays is the main character's girlfriend who has a falling out with him. In real life, she had a falling out with the director of the movie, Brad Jones, when she revealed many abuses one of the other actors of that movie, Doug Walker, had thrown her way along with the CEO of the website they worked at, Channel Awesome, and Brad basically dismissed her complaints in an interview, through Twitter, etc., despite being her ""friend"" and having done many videos with her."
4,"Famous people it would be impossible to make biopics about Robin Williams

His voice and looks are just too iconic, if someone tried to pass themselves off as Robin, it just wouldn't work, no matter how good the performance is. There's just not that many celebrities out there that look and sound like Williams and Hollywood probably wouldn't cast an unknown in the role. 

I will say that, with the beard, Bradley Cooper looked a bit like Robin Williams in A Star is Born but, again, I can't see him doing Williams's voice or imitating his facial expressions so it would just come off as a guy calling himself Robin Williams.

So, yeah, probably for the best we don't get a Robin Williams biopic, at least one on the silver screen. Maybe a TV one where they'd be more open to casting an unknown in the role."
4,"Actors who should've been in remakes/adaptations/biopics/etc. Are there any actors you think should've played a character in a remake, adaptation, biopic, etc. yet they chose someone else?

Dakota Fanning should've been the new Carrie not Chloe Grace Moretz

Nothing against Chloe, she's been good in other stuff, but she just wasn't right for Carrie. Even if you look past whether or not she's too pretty, her acting as an awkward, shy teenager just isn't convincing, it always feels like she's pretending to be awkward and shy rather than being awkward and shy. The only time she's convincing in that movie is near the end when she becomes vengeful and starts killing everyone and even then she does those stupid hand movements like she's a demonic version of Elsa or something

If Fanning had played Carrie, though, it would've fit better because there's always been something off about her anyway, she would've fit the role to a T. Plus I feel like they cast Moretz mainly so they could go ""SEE? We're not like that old movie, our main character is actually played by a TEENAGER this time, not someone whose, like, 30!"" but they ended up going the opposite extreme and hired a high school sophomore who looked like a high school sophomore to play a high school senior. Dakota Fanning would've been 18 when she shot it, which means she would've been a high school senior playing a high school senior. If they wanted to avoid casting someone near 30, just casting someone who was 17-18 to play someone whose 17-18 would've made more sense than casting someone barely out of freshman year."
4,"Actors who are usually bad but sometimes good/Actors who are usually good but sometimes bad Is there any actor who you usually can't stand but occasionally gives a good performance?

Matthew. Broderick.

In 90% of the films he's in, he gives lifeless, monotone performances. I didn't even like him in The Lion King and (while I know I'm the minority here) Election. Election is a great movie, don't get me wrong, but I think it's great in spite of him not because of him.

But there is Ferris Bueller. And Biloxi Blues. And while some thought he was miscast, I thought he was good in Glory. He was supposed to be a stiff, uppity general and I thought he did that fine. Honestly, the worst part about his performance is that his accent slips at one point. Sure Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman were much better than he was but that's fine, it fits the character. He was also good in the 2 episodes of 30 Rock he was in and his vocal performance in Bojack Horseman was great. Also, he was decent in The Producers, yes his acting was over the top but everyone's was, it fit the tone the movie was going for. And he was surprisingly one of the better things about Rules Don't Apply.

But, yeah, otherwise he tends to be a really bland, boring actor. It just seems like the directors for these movies were somehow able to get him to make more interesting performances that other directors couldn't muster out of him.

Also, when I lived in New York, I met him and Sarah separately and he wasn't MEAN but he was just as bland and boring in real life as he is in his movies. And Sarah was nice and friendly, like she usually is in her movies."
4,"Themes you notice keep popping up in directors work Ronald Emmerich's disaster movies can basically be described as the same movies with different disasters. In his disaster movies you usually have:

\-A benevolent scientist/tech geek who finds out the world is in trouble before everyone else does (Goldblum in ID4, Broderick in Godzilla, Quaid in Day After Tomorrow, Ejiofor in 2012)

\-The Government either doesn't believe him at first or they do and try to cover it up

\-There's usually a big, bad Government official whose trying to make things harder for the scientist/tech geek and keeps bullying our hero or trying to discredit his work (Rebhorn in ID4, The Siskel and Ebert parodies in Godzilla, Holm in Day After Tomorrow, Platt in 2012)

\-There's another character whose a more normal guy who gets swept up in all of this and has to work with the scientist/tech geek to save the world (Smith in ID4, Azaria in Godzilla, Gyllenhall(?) in Day After Tomorrow, Cusack in 2012)

\-There's a mysterious figure/conspiracy theorist who knows that shit has also been going down and runs in with the scientist as well (Randy Quaid in ID4, Reno in Godzilla, Harrelson in 2012)

\-There's also a girlfriend character who the main character (or someone else) had a falling out with but, by the end, they get back together (Colin in ID4, Pitillo in Godzilla, Peet in 2012)

\-There's also some famous monument getting blown up (White House in ID4, Madison Square Garden in Godzilla, and so many monuments in Day After Tomorrow and 2012)

Also I've noticed his movies tend to not cast typical action heroes but movie stars who look more like regular guys who are then thrust into scenarios you wouldn't expect them to be in (i.e. Goldblum in ID4, Broderick in Godzilla, Quaid and Gyllenhall in Day After Tomorrow, and the entire cast of 2012). Even Will Smith kinda fits in this category considering he wasn't an action hero when ID4 came out, he was known for his rap career and sitcom. If anything, that movie turned him into an action star (sure Goldblum had Jurassic Park beforehand but I'd still hesitate to call him an ""action star"")."
4,"Actors who never age Examples?

Missi Pyle has been in her 40's for seemingly ever, even when she was in her 30's. She played a twentysomething in Josie & The Pussycats then started playing more middle aged characters starting in Big Fish and has played the character around the same age for freaking ever. It says something that she played Tom Arnold's wife, whose supposed to be the same age as him, in Soul Plane back in 2004 and is now playing Luke Evans's girlfriend, whose supposed to be the same age as him, in Ma.

She's like a waspy, thin Edie McClurg.

Speaking of Edie McClurg, she didn't really age from Small Wonder to back when she was still acting. See if you can find a recent picture of her and she looked to be about the same age. 

For more A-list examples, Will Smith hasn't aged much since his Fresh Prince days. It kinda makes the premise of Gemini Man weird because he doesn't look much different from his ""younger"" clone.

Most celebrities don't seem to age much throughout the years. For example, in Mamma Mia 2, only one of the actors (Julie Walters) looked drastically older than they did in the first movie even though the movie came out ten years after the first one."
4,"Good movies with bad soundtracks Has this ever happened? Has a good movie ever had a bad soundtrack, whether it be a bad musical score or bad songs?

This is REALLY subjective but I wasn't a fan of the soundtrack for Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse

I did like one song, the 80's song when Miles and Peter were spinning webs, and the snippets of the Christmas album were funny.

But the rest of the soundtrack was filled with generic, autotuned modern rap and I'm just not really a fan of that type of music.

I will say it did fit the movie because it did fit the setting and it is the kind of music people Miles's age would be interested in but, on its own, I didn't really care for the soundtrack from that movie."
4,"Movies that focus more on spectacle than story What are some movies that come to mind where the plot and characters are really weak and it really does feel like the filmmakers are just focusing on the spectacle they're selling the movie as and only treat the plot and characters as something that has to be there when the things the movie is really sold on aren't on screen?

I think most of Michael Bay's filmography counts as this. The Rock is a slight exception, if anything I actually thought the characters, performances, some of the shots/talky scenes, and dialogue were stronger than the action scenes, but otherwise, yeah, he really focuses more on action than he does plot and characters, especially with the Transformers movies (and I'm guessing the strength in The Rock's non-action stuff is mostly due to Aaron Sorkin helping to write the screenplay).

Also The Greatest Showman is this for musicals. The plot is cliched and the characters, besides Barnum and, I dunno, The Critic maybe, have about one personality trait each, if that. It really feels like the filmmakers would've made the entire thing song numbers but felt like that wouldn't sell but didn't really care for the talky scenes, they just saw it as a means to an end. And it made me surprised the movie became the surprise hit it was because many people have agreed they just really like it for the songs but there have been musicals that have become just as popular for its story and characters as it has for its songs. Disney's the prime example here, they remind you that people love the stories and characters in their movies as well as the songs All. The. Goddamn. Time!

It's the same thing with Michael Bay and, oh, Marvel. Marvel has just as much spectacle as a Michael Bay movie (usually) but people actually care about the characters in the MCU. Could the average joe really name any characters in the Transformers movies besides the robots? Probably not.

So what's the point of something like the Transformers movies when something like the MCU exists and can be just as enjoyable when people aren't fighting each other? And what's the point of something like The Greatest Showman when something like most of Disney's (original) animated filmmography exists and can be just as enjoyable when people or talking animals aren't singing?"
4,"Actors and Filmmakers whose careers are dead and you're not sure why What exactly caused John Travolta to do strictly Direct to VOD movies? It couldn't have been Battlefield Earth, he was headlining major, wide-release movies for 10 years after that so what killed his career? I know he did some weird things in his personal life earlier this decade, was that it? He did also make a lot of poor movie choices but they didn't seem to be enough to kill his career. I know From Paris with Love basically flopped, is that the movie that killed his career? What happened to it? Or is it Savages, even though he only had a supporting role in it? What the hell happened to Travolta?

Also what happened to David O. Russell's career? After Joy came out and underperformed, he basically disappeared from making movies. I find it hard to believe one failed Oscar Bait film was enough to kill his career so what happened to him? I'm not exactly complaining because he's apparently an abusive asshole, I'm just surprised he hasn't made a movie in 4 years, that's all..."
4,"Laziest looking fantasy creatures in film What are some of the laziest designs you've ever seen for a ""fantasy creature"" in a movie?

Troll 2 comes to mind. They just got people with dwarfism and put them in bad Halloween costumes they probably found at a local Halloween shop.

Speaking of little people, Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory just had the Oompa Loompas be Deep Roy dressed in spandex or some wacky outfit, there's nothing really otherwordly about them other than how they dress and the fact that they are all played by the same guy. At least the orange makeup and green hair made them look like an entirely different species. Here not so much. Sure ""little people who just dress kinda weird"" was sorta how they were portrayed in the book (well they were actually african pygmies at first but, yeah, that's neither here nor there) but that might've been one of the changes the '71 film had that Burton should've kept. It's just odd that they are just little people that dress weird and yet they are supposed to be these creatures people have never heard of, it's like dwarfism doesn't exist in this movie's world.

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindenwald did something similar. The tiny woman who Credence thinks is his Mother at first only to find out she's actually his former nanny is supposed to be half-elf. They never state that in the movie and I just found out later on, I literally thought they just randomly hired a lady with dwarfism for the role. Why? 'Cause they didn't change her to look elfish at all, they just took this tiny lady and dressed her up in stereotypical nanny clothes. God at least Professor Flitwick had pointy ears, even when he got younger, this just feels really cheap and lazy for the Harry Potter franchise."
4,"Sequels that felt like apologies for its predecessors Are there any sequels that felt like they were trying to apologize for an element in its predecessor that some people complained about?

Some of the Direct to VHS/DVD Disney Sequels do this.

Pocahontas 2 tried to be more historically accurate than the original by having her fall for John Rolfe, dump John Smith, and making it clear at the beginning that the Native Americans and the English did not have a happy ending. Seeing as it's still a Disney film, I'm pretty sure it's sanitized from what exactly happened in real life but, still, they were trying to make an effort to be a teensy bit more accurate while still trying to be family friendly (which means it probably wasn't very historically accurate, you can't really show genocide in a Disney film for one thing). Also, from what I vaguely remember, it seems like they were trying to make Ratcliffe more intimidating and less buffoonish than he was in the original.

Also The Lion King 2 should've been called The Lion King 2: We're not Racist and Sexist because it seemed to be trying to have a more proactive female protagonist than any of the lionesses in the original, one whose even training to become queen, and having an anti-racism message to counteract the whole ""all hyenas are evil and deserve to die in a cave"" thing the original had. 

And The Hunchback of Notre Dame 2 seemed to be counteracting the complaints that Quasimodo didn't get with Esmerelda by giving him a new love interest, as if to say ""See? We think Quasimodo can find love"".

Also not a direct to DVD sequel but The Angry Birds Movie 2 looks to be doing this from what I saw in the previews. People complained the first movie was a pro-racism, anti-immigration film and the movie seems to be fixing that by having the pigs, the characters people said were metaphors for immigrants, teaming up with the birds, the characters people said were metaphors for americans, to stop another enemy."
4,"Actors whose careers seemed finished and then one movie brought them back Are there any actors whose career seemed to be over then one movie sort of brought them back into the limelight seemingly out of nowhere?

John Wick basically did this for Keanu Reeves

Before John Wick, it seemed like that Day The Earth Stood Still remake killed his career because he was barely in anything for a while. And most of the movies he had been doing post-DTESS were independent films.

He did try to come back with 47 Ronin but that was a huge bomb at the box office.

Then John Wick came in and while he's still not quite as huge of a star as he used to be, that movie has definitely given him a successful franchise that should keep him busy for the next few years.

What are some examples of actors whose careers seemed finished then they came back seemingly out of nowhere thanks to one successful movie?"
4,"Common complaints about movies you disagree with Are there any complaints you've heard about movies that you disagree with?

I've heard many people call Rocket Raccoon ""underrated"". Even a twitter search for Rocket Raccoon Underrated has more than a few choices: [https://twitter.com/search?q=Rocket%20Raccoon%20underrated&src=typd](https://twitter.com/search?q=Rocket%20Raccoon%20underrated&src=typd)

And, it's not that I dislike Rocket, it's just I wouldn't call him underrated because, well, he's a pretty recognizable character now. Have these people ever seen a raccoon video or photo online? Someone is ALWAYS posting Rocket Raccoon references. And most people in generally know who he is, even if they don't know his name, if you say the raccoon from Guardians of the Galaxy, they'll know who you're talking about.

I guess I could maybe see why people would say he's underrated when it comes to the larger MCU universe. If people talk about the MCU in general, he doesn't get brought up much but that might be mostly due to the fact that he's been a supporting character and mainly one of the comic relief characters. Yes he has had his own arc but the arc doesn't have a huge effect on the story of the entire MCU and, even in the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, it's Peter Quill's arc that's been focused on first and foremost, so I can see why the average person might remember Rocket more for his quips that get memed to death than how he's grown between movies. Still, he is recognizable so I wouldn't call him ""underrated"". It would be like saying Luis from Ant-Man is underated when he's well known for his ""story recap"" scenes, those get memed all the time."
4,"Movies that aren't good but are way better than a movie with a similar premise Are there any movies that, on their own, aren't good at all but, compared to a movie that had a similar premise, it's much better?

I'd say Boss Baby is this to Baby Geniuses

Boss Baby is a bad movie but the animators and voice actors at least seem to really be trying, it's just that the script is so inane (sometimes it's framed as a bedtime story being told by a grown up version of the main character, sometimes it's a movie that's completely told from the kid's imagination, sometimes all these things happening are actually real, like, god, make up your mind!) BUT compared to Baby Geniuses, that's nothing.

That movie is not only poorly written but it's also just ugly to look at, especially when the babies start talking, plus it's poorly shot, poorly lit, poorly, well, almost everything, and the celebrities they were able to rope in (Kathleen Turner, Kim Catrall, Dom Deluise, ESPECIALLY Christopher Lloyd, etc.) don't get much to do. They just feel like they're in there just so the filmmakers could say they worked with these actors. Plus at least Boss Baby is about a baby whose actually a boss. The babies in Baby Geniuses don't do anything that smart, let alone show any signs of genius level intellect, except for maybe the main baby who, at one point, uses some techy things to escape. That's about it."
4,"Before They Were Stars moments in movies that predicted the actors' future success Are there any moments in movies (or maybe TV shows) actors were in before they were famous that oddly seemed to predict their future careers?

One of Ryan Reynolds' first jobs was in the pilot movie for Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Weird then how he would carve a career doing comic book movies (Blade Trinity, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Green Lantern, R.I.P.D., The Deadpool movies, Detective Pikachu if we count it as a manga adaptation as there are Pokemon mangas out there, the list goes on). Also in Sabrina the Teenage Witch, I swear his hair oddly looks like he took Pikachu's fur and made a wig out of it: [https://www.bustle.com/p/ryan-reynolds-was-in-the-sabrina-the-teenage-witch-movie-wow-is-it-a-blast-from-the-past-9729026](https://www.bustle.com/p/ryan-reynolds-was-in-the-sabrina-the-teenage-witch-movie-wow-is-it-a-blast-from-the-past-9729026) (look at that thumbnail and don't tell me that his hair looks like that)

Speaking of Detective Pikachu, Justice Smith sung The Pokemon theme in Paper Towns: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S\_ZQ1gvYt\_w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ZQ1gvYt_w)

Going back to comic book movies, Chris Evans' first ever job was in an environmental video called Biodiversity Wild About Life!: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzjN9DzxZg8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzjN9DzxZg8). In the very beginning, Evans sees a video of a BLACK PANTHER and goes ""I like that panther"". Also, near the end, a guy warns Evans and his friends about stopping raccoons from stealing turtle eggs. And then, two decades later, a raccoon vowed he'd steal his friend's arm."
4,"Actors who aren't bad necessarily just used poorly most of the time Are there any actors who aren't necessarily bad actors, it just seems like they tend to choose scripts poorly and also tend to make terrible use of their personas and or/talent?

Ryan Reynolds. I'd argue even to this day (just look at Life)

In Deadpool, his snarky asshole persona is used well because Wade isn't such an asshole to the point where he gets too annoying. I can't say the same for Just Friends or The Change-Up, his characters were INSUFFERABLE in those movies but I can't say it's completely his fault. Even if, say, Bradley Cooper had played his characters, they'd still be unlikeable. No actor could've made the characters in those movies likeable, they were just unlikeable on the page.

Similar thing with Safe House, his character was unlikeable in that movie too, though not because he was an asshole, because he wasn't, but because his character was such an idiot he caused a lot of bad things in the movie to happen. He literally lets Denzel go IN A GIANT STADIUM at one point, even though he still thinks he's a bad guy at that point. Killed the movie for me.

I will just say, though, that even though I don't think any actor could've made his character in Just Friends likeable, his performance didn't really help, he mugged a lot in that movie, like he was trying too hard to be funny. And, in R.I.P.D., he just looked bored, he did the opposite of what Jeff Bridges did and phoned it in.

Otherwise, in his bad movies (and he makes a lot), he just kinda does his job, play a horny, snarky asshole and does a fine job at it.

He's kinda like a white Will Smith without the rapping career, he's charismatic, markets himself a lot, but has a tendency to pick bad movies, with a few exceptions here and there.

Oh yeah Will Smith's another good example but I'm sure plenty of people are gonna point to him."
4,"Movies that would've been way better if they had cut one thing Are there any movies you thought were bad to terrible that you'd probably have a lot more respect for if they got rid of one thing about it?

Honestly, I'm not sure I'd hate The Greatest Showman as much as I do if they didn't try to force a ""woke"" message into the movie. Not that ""woke"" messages in movies are bad all the time, there are plenty of movies with progressive themes that are good to great, but there's a difference between actually trying to be ""woke"" and just trying to look progressive because it makes yourself look good for the audience and I feel like The Greatest Showman falls in the latter category. I mean the plot is centered entirely on Barnum and his rise, fall, and rise again. And the movie has flashy musical numbers to fit in. It just doesn't really have time to flesh out the sub-plots about The Circus Troupe finding self acceptance or Zac and Zendaya trying to become an interracial couple in the 1800's so those sub-plots so the sub-plots end up feeling forced in as a result, which really ends up feeling like they were put in at the last minute because racism and bigotry are hot topics and the writers wanted the movie to seem ""relevant"", not because they were actually interested in talking about those topics.

If they had actually wanted to be ""woke"", they should've either cut one of those sub-plots so the movie could have more time to develop the characters in those sub-plots OR just leave the woke stuff behind and make it a movie about Barnum learning to value his true friends and family. Trying to juggle 3 sub-plots and flashy musical numbers just ends up making the movie come off as a mess that wants to be woke so it can seem hip rather than be a movie with an actual message."
4,"Movie follow ups that were big hits at the time but almost no one remembers now Are there any movies that were a follow up to a hit movie, whether they be a sequel or two actors from another beloved movie reuniting or a director's follow up film, that were box office hits when they first came out but now no one talks about them?

This happened to both You've Got Mail and Runaway Bride

Their predecessors, Sleepless in Seattle and Pretty Woman, are still well remembered to this day. And these two movies did well at the box office mainly because they were about two movie stars people loved seeing together in one movie reuniting with each other. But I haven't really seen anyone talk about these two in years. Hell, last time I saw Runaway Bride mentioned, it was the afternoon movie on HBO...

Can you think of any movies that were big hits because they followed up another movie in some way yet now no one remembers them?"
4,"Movies that have had the opposite of a critical reappraisal Are there any movies that were beloved by audiences and critics when it first came out then started to get criticized at the least a few years later?

By that I mean not movies that were critically acclaimed yet audiences hated them or movies that were critically acclaimed, audiences loved, then started speaking out against them when they got too popular the same year they came out but movies that, at the time of its release, were beloved by critics and audiences (or maybe just audiences) but, a few years later at least, audiences and critics are now speaking out against them?

Even by the low standards of campus comedies, Revenge of the Nerds is being criticized more than ever before. I don't think it was ever LOVED by critics but audiences adored those nerds' hi-jinks back in the 80's. Now it's basically seen as the movie where nerds sexually assault and rape women and are awarded for it.

I mean, yeah, people have pointed out the problems of, oh, Animal House too but, from what I've seen, people still think the movie is good, just problematic. I'm not sure I can really say the same for Revenge of the Nerds.

Also this seems to have happened to Hidden Figures in the span of two years. When it first came out, it was praised by audiences and critics for being an important story about a little known part of history that everyone needed to see, a movie where African Americans were able to rise above the segregated south and become pioneers at NASA.

Now, only two years later, it's seen as a white savior movie. Green Book really f'd up that movie's reputation. I mean, yeah, it's not the only movie that people have called a ""white savior movie"" but it feels like people were calling The Help and Green Book movies about white saviors even when they first came out, while Hidden Figures only seems to have gotten that reputation recently, I didn't really see anyone call it that when it first came out."
4,"Actors who played one character who should've played another character Are there any actors who played a character in a movie but, when watching, you thought they should've played another character?

Michelle Williams should've played Jenny Lind not Charity Barnum in The Greatest Showman. I mean, Michelle Williams as someone who we see growing up with HUGH JACKMAN?

What happened to Australia Hugh? Y'know, a movie where you played the romantic lead to someone YOUR AGE? It's one thing for A-list actors to start off being cast as the love interests to women their own age then, as they get older, getting younger love interests, that happens all the time, but this is the only time I can think of where an actor started off having been cast alongside women his age and then, when he was older, has a movie that shows a MONTAGE of him growing up with someone played by someone whose 12 years younger than him. And it's ridiculous.

And there's no reason for it, who on set REFUSED to have Charity played by someone around Hugh's age? It couldn't have been Hugh himself, he has a wife whose OLDER than him, he of all people should be okay with being cast alongside someone his own age. And it couldn't have been the producers either, they also produced THE HEAT, a movie starring two fortysomething woman that made THEM money. Even though I know The Greatest Showman isn't trying to be like The Heat, still, they should've learned from that movie's success that audiences don't care about the age of their lead characters, if their a man or woman, no matter who the target audience is or what kind've movie they're trying to make. So who on set said NOPE, HUGH CAN'T HAVE A LOVE INTEREST OVER 40, EVEN IF WE LITERALLY SEE THEM GROWING UP TOGETHER?!

But Michelle Williams is a very talented actress (Have you seen Fosse/Verdon? The show so far is only okay at best but she and Rockwell give great performances) and I don't wanna see her out of a job so, instead, Charity should've been played by someone around Hugh's age and Michelle Williams should've been Jenny Lind instead.

Oh and, while we're at it, please don't make Jenny Lind some vindictive woman that can't stand that P.T. Barnum isn't attracted to her so she tries to make it look like their having an affair to get back at him for rejecting her advances. That's just really disrespectful to a dead woman. Instead, they should've just built off of what they were doing with the circus troupe, and have her get put off by Barnum and wanting nothing to do with him for some reason (maybe what actually happened to them in real life? Just a thought...) like what eventually happened with the circus troupe which, y'know, would've actually helped develop Barnum's character as it would make him realize what an A-hole he was and get back to his family and friends."
4,"Casting decisions that sounded horrible but turned out to be really good Are there any casting decisions that, on paper, just sounded like really bad ideas but, in execution, the actors ended up giving great performances?

As much as I disliked Batman vs. Superman, Ben Affleck wasn't a bad Batman even though he sounds like the last person I'd want to play Batman. That being said his Batman was a very unlikable character but that's more on the writing than him.

I'm going to cheat and use a TV example but Louie Anderson in Baskets. Louie Anderson as a woman sounds awful. When I first saw the show, I didn't know much about it other than Zach Galifianakis plays a clown and Louis C.K. (at the time) was producing it so I didn't expect him to be playing Zach's Mom. And when he did, my first thought was, ""Louie Anderson as a WOMAN?! Are they freaking kidding me?!"" But the more I watched it, the more I started accepting it because, yeah, Louie Anderson gives a great performance, mostly because he doesn't play it like ""Oh my god, I'm playing a woman, isn't that wacky?!"", like you think he would, he plays the character like a regular woman and also imbues a lot of depth in her. There's a reason he got an emmy for this role (and yeah, now Louie Goddamn Anderson is an EMMY winner)."
4,"Great actors who were cast in roles they just weren't right for Can you think of any examples of actors who are great but they just weren't right for a particular role and it showed at the end of the day?

I know the movie hasn't come out yet and maybe when we see the final product, things will turn out differently, but Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar.

When I first heard that casting choice, I didn't think he was really a good fit at all. Granted I haven't seen his more villainous roles, I'm more used to him playing good guys, but I just don't think his voice really has the menace necessary for Scar. And that trailer really didn't change my mind about that, he just comes off as really miscast at the moment. If anything, Chiwetel should've been Simba rather than Scar, he actually would've made a pretty good Simba, he's played conflicted protagonists trying to make a decision before and that's basically who Simba is so, yeah, he should've been Simba.

What are some picks for you for actors who are great, they just don't fit the character?"
4,"Weirdest cast replacements ever What are some of the oddest cast replacements you've ever seen in a sequel?

Patton Oswalt replacing Louis C.K. in The Secret Life of Pets 2 comes to mind

Sure I'm all in for them firing Louis C.K. That's not what's weird.

What's weird is that Patton Oswalt has a much, much higher voice than Louis C.K. does so it just looks odd how the main dog from that movie somehow has a more high pitched voice than he did beforehand. I mean, what happened, did he get neutered before the events of the sequel? It just seems odd they couldn't think of another celebrity to replace him that, if not sounded like C.K., at least sounded like a C.K. type. Was Jason Sudeikis too busy?"
4,"Movies that say one thing and then do another Are there any movies (or sequels to movies) that either established something about their universe or tried to have a message and then did something that completely contradicted whatever they established beforehand?

Ralph Breaks the Internet did this

First of all the plot got started because Ralph went into Sugar Rush and built a new course during the time the arcade was open. Wasn't it established that they had to be in their games when people were around because, if they didn't, their games would be shut down if anyone found out? I guess it's lucky for him no one was playing his game when all of this was happening!

The movie also seems to forget that in general. The first movie established that ""game jumping"" or going to a new game was bad yet Vanellope does it and is rewarded for it at the end of the movie. It's like the people at Disney forgot about this rule that they established, which is weird considering the director and writers of the first movie came back for the sequel. Even if they didn't remember every single detail of a movie they made, surely they could've watched it again to refresh their memories

&#x200B;

The Greatest Showman also has a weird relationship with short jokes. When we first meet Tom Thumb (or Charles Stratton), we're supposed to feel sorry for him because he doesn't want people laughing at him and he even closes the door on Barnum when he suggests people will be laughing at him no matter what so he might as well do it. And, in that scene, Thumb is portrayed in the right. Then, a couple scenes later there's a joke where, during Come Alive, Barnum has to WUH OH pick Thumb up and put him on a horse. But then later on they meet The Queen and everyone at the court laughs at him and, again, the movie portrays this as a bad thing, as something we're supposed to feel bad about, the scene literally ends with him looking sad. And then after THAT there's sight gags where he sits on Barnum's top hat and rides on a baby elephant!

It's like the movie can't make up its goddamn mind whether or not short jokes are bad. It's like Farquaad in Shrek all over again, except much worse because, while the movie tried to have a message of don't judge people by their looks, that movie never specifically said short jokes are bad and then did them anyway like The Greatest Showman did. And Farquaad was a character we were supposed to hate regardless of the jokes or his height while we're supposed to LIKE Thumb!"
4,"Movies that only killed one career while the careers of everyone else were fine Can you think of a movie that killed only one actor's career while everyone else's careers were just fine?

Every movie Meg Ryan made in the 2000's

Kate & Leopold didn't kill her career but it did basically kill her image as a romantic comedy lead as it was the last time she starred in a romantic comedy (being 40 when it came out didn't help). However it absolutely didn't hurt Hugh Jackman's career and Viola Davis and Kristen Schaal both had small parts in it and they definitely went on to better things.

Same thing with In the Cut and Against the Ropes, which were attempts at re-inventing herself to be more edgy. They also bombed but, again, In the Cut at least didn't kill Mark Ruffalo's career. And Omar Epps at least got a decent gig with House.

And the-en there was The Women, which is the last time she's been seen in a mainstream flick. Literally all of the women except for her and Eva Mendes still have strong careers to this day. But even Eva Mendes managed to snag a few decent gigs including The Other Guys, Bad Lieutenant, Fast Five, Holy Motors, and The Place Beyond the Pines. Meg Ryan has barely acted since The Women and what she's done include a guest spot on Web Therapy, two independent films, one she directed, two failed TV pilots, and an ABC Family Original Movie.

Somehow it seems like The Women has killed her career but spared everyone else's. Yeah Eva Mendes's career died but it happened after the fact, Meg's died right after The Women came out."
4,"Movies that were only successful because they came out at the right time Are there any movies that were successful but, if they had come out another time, no one would've cared about them?

I think I've come to peace that Zootopia is this

I honestly couldn't believe Zootopia had an almost perfect Rotten Tomatoes rating it had or made a goddamn billion dollars and I was admittedly obsessing over it, making post after post about it on /r/Zootopia and elsewhere, trying to figure out why hardly anyone was talking about this movie. I mean, name a character or a scene from that movie that's really become iconic in pop culture? ONE.

I just couldn't believe that a completely average movie like this from people we know have the talent to make good to great movies would have the rotten tomatoes rating it had or that a movie audiences were rarely talking about was making the money it was. But, now that I think about it, I've realized that the only reason critics were going ga-ga for it and audiences were going to see it wasn't because it was a great movie like the best of WDAS or Pixar but because it came out when racism was a hot topic. If it had come out 5-10 years earlier and was the exact same movie, at best it probably would've ended up like Meet the Robinsons or Bolt, a movie critics liked and it has a small following but it wouldn't be something everyone was seeing, something that makes a goddamn billion dollars and it probably would've gotten more like, oh, a 78% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and critics wouldn't be hyping it up as ""an important movie you got to see because of its message"" (which, read the reviews, that's what MANY critics were saying about it) but rather ""a cute movie about talking animals that has a good message to boot"".

What's your example of a movie that only became successful because it came out at the right time, right place?"
4,"Sequels that flanderized characters If you don't know what flanderization means, it's basically when a movie sequel or tv show simplifies its characters to having one trait. It stems from, well, Ned Flanders, who started off as a more well rounded character and became a one dimensional christian joke over time.

Anyway what are some examples for you?

Both Dumb and Dumber sequels, both When Harry Met Lloyd and Dumb and Dumber To. In the original, Harry and Lloyd were obviously stupid, it's literally called Dumb and Dumber for a reason, but they were stupid to a point, as dumb as they were, there were definitely things even THEY would be too smart to do or there would be things even they noticed. For example, Harry noticed him and Lloyd were struggling to make ends meet and was trying to get Lloyd to be more safe with money. In the sequels, however, their stupidity is really, really exaggerated, if something is stupid, they'll do it no matter what it is.

Same thing kinda happened with Sid the Sloth in Ice Age 2, though in a different way. In the original, he was an idiot but he was still a mostly nice guy and never said anything really malicious or mean. In Ice Age 2, he is apparently so stupid he  keeps making fun of Manny the Mammoth's sadness about possibly being the last of his kind and he dances with a bunch of vultures when they sing about eating everybody. He's portrayed as so stupid he basically becomes an asshole but it's okay because he's too stupid to realize he's being an asshole.

Also Therman Merman in Bad Santa 2. In the original, Therman was naive and innocent but also shy, quiet, and reserved, only really being talkative when he was talking about Santa and Christmas with Willie but otherwise he kept to hismelf. In the sequel, they keep the naive and innocent part but make him less shy and make him a really giggly, happy manchild who always wants to make friends. In other words, they turned him into Buddy from Elf, except with a much deeper voice, which honestly made him really, really creepy.

Same thing happened with Marcus. He went from being the straight man to Willie who wanted him to get his shit together that was also horny and the butt of short jokes to a character whose sole purpose in the movie is to either be horny or be the butt of short jokes. There is a thing about there being tension between him and Willie considering he, y'know, tried to kill Willie last time but it's only mentioned a few times and it's a pretty damn underdeveloped plot point, mostly his role has been reduced to being made fun of for being short and getting horny."
4,"Your thoughts on Miss Peregrine (2016) As someone who has no knowledge of the books (I didn't even know they existed until the movie came out), it was okay. There are some cool, creative scenes like that one kid bringing the dead kid back to life or the skeleton fight but, on the other hand, the plot was pretty cliche, it was basically just your usual fantasy kids film about a normal kid with no friends going into a fantasy world, and the acting ranges from talented people being given nothing to do to poor. The kid actors are okay but Eva Green basically just does her best Helena Bonham Carter impression, Samuel L. Jackson is barely in the movie, which is weird considering he's supposed to be the main villain, Allison Janney and Judi Freaking Dench are in the movie even less, and Chris O'Dowd's ""american accent"" seems to come and go.

For its creativity, I think it helped elevate it to alright, not Burton's worst but definitely not his best. What do you think of the movie?"
4,"Movies that were overshadowed by controversy The. Interview.

That is the textbook example of a movie overshadowed by controversy.

It is literally a movie people thought would get us killed because Kim Jung Un threatened to bomb us if we released it.

I can't really think of a movie that's more worthy of being named a movie where the controversy surrounding it was talked about more than the movie itself.

Of course we did end up releasing it and...nothing happened. As it turns out, Kim Jung Un was full of shit and he didn't bomb us! It honestly makes me surprised people get scared when he does threaten to bomb us. Like he couldn't bomb us over a MOVIE, do you really think he's gonna bomb us over something that's actually important?

But, because he didn't, the movie's been completely forgotten.

Hell a couple years ago I even remember seeing it was on TBS. Yeah the movie had become so forgotten it went from being the movie that will kill us all to a movie that's randomly playing on TBS in the afternoon.

What's an example you can think of of a movie that was overshadowed by controversy?"
4,"Biopics/movies inspired by real events that downplayed the contributions of someone in the story Are there any biopics you can think of that made successful people either look like failures or just downplayed their success to a surprising degree? This actually seems to happen a lot:

The Blind Side made Michael Oher look completely helpless before he was adopted, to the point that THEY taught him how to play Football even though that wasn't the case at all

The Disaster Artist made Greg Sestero look like a complete failure whose only success as an actor before The Room was getting an agent while, in real life, he was definitely not famous but he did manage to book some gigs here and there before The Room and even starred in a direct to video sequel to Puppet Master. Again it wasn't much but the movie made it look like he wasn't able to book a single job before Tommy made The Room!

Bohemian Rhapsody didn't mention David Bowie at all even though they still played Under Pressure, although that probably has to do with the fact that Bowie's family isn't particularly interested in having a biopic made about him so they probably didn't put him in for legal reasons. But the movie did imply at the end that Queen singlehandedly made Live Aid a success instead of, y'know, implying the other performers also helped to raise money

If it counts as a biopic, The Greatest Showman for some odd reason turned Charles Stratton/Tom Thumb from Barnum's most famous ""freak"" (he made more money than Michael Jackson, look it up) to basically his LEAST popular ""freak"", the one whose got his own act separate from the other troupe members where he wears a Napoleon suit and starts the show by riding around on animals while everyone else partakes in well choreographed musical numbers and trapeze acts. If anything, the movie seemed to imply The Bearded Lady was the star of the show, though I'm guessing that was to take advantage of Keala Settle's lovely voice

For a movie all about how black women had jobs at NASA in a time when it's hard to believe that was even legal, Hidden Figures sure did like to downplay the three womens' accomplishments. There are stuff in there that they were able to fight for on their own and succeeded that, instead, Kevin Costner ended up being the one that got them equal treatment. For example, Taraji P. Henson's character was able to fight for and get to use the whites bathroom by herself, she didn't get her boss to come in and say ""we all pee the same color"" like what happened in the movie

Also if The King and I and The Sound of Music count as biopics, both those musicals made King Mongkut and Captain Von Trapp look like bigger assholes than they were, in fact King Mongkut was a very modern, progressive king and Captain Von Trapp was a very warm, friendly father who loved to sing, the people these characters were based on were almost completely different from how they were portrayed in the musicals

Can anyone think of any other examples?"
4,"Actors who are playing characters much younger than they are Can you think of any examples?

Dustin Hoffman was 30 and played a 20-21 year old in The Graduate

Pretty much everyone in Grease, the youngest cast member was 20 and the oldest was 34

If you think about it, almost everyone in The Disaster Artist. Depending on who you ask, James Franco is either a few years older than Tommy Wiseau was when he made the movie or he's 10 years younger than Tommy was when he made the movie. Greg Sestero, Juliette Danielle, and most of the actors playing the friends were in their 20's when they made The Room but Dave Franco, Ari Graynor, June Diane Raphael, Zac Efron, and Nathan Fielder were all in their 30's when they made it. On the other hand, though, Josh Hutcherson is around the same age Philip Haldiman was when he filmed the movie and Jackie Weaver was only a few years older than Carolyn Minnot."
4,"Movies that could've come out in another decade Are there any other movies that may mention recent things and may even have the production values and cinematography of a recent film but, stylistically, feel likes movies that could've come out in another decade?

Grindhouse is an intentional example of this, as it's supposed to be aping 70's Drive-in movies.

Wonder, though, felt like some mid-late 90's sentimental family drama ala Simon Birch, Jack (if that counts, he's technically supposed to be a kid), The Cure, or The Mighty about an outcast kid whose different for some reason showing the rest of the world he is special. This movie felt like it could've come out in the 90's and it would fit in PERFECTLY. All it's missing is a song by, like, Bryan Adams or Babyface over the end credits.

Do you have any examples of movies that feel like they could've been released in another decade?"
4,"Actors/Filmmakers who you didn't think were talented and then one movie changed your mind Are there any actors you thought were bad actors or filmmakers whose movies you didn't like but then they made a movie that made you realize ""hey, they're not that bad after all""?

I know I'm in the minority here but I didn't like The Lobster and I've heard, even among Yorgos's fans, The Killing of a Sacred Deer is divisive and I'm on the side of people who didn't like that movie. But I actually really liked The Favourite. In my opinion, The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer went for style over substance while The Favourite was definitely a weird movie but it had an interesting story to go along with it.

Also I used to think Channing Tatum was the worst actor ever but he's improved. I still don't think he's a great actor but his acting's gotten better since his Step Up days and, even then, he actually wasn't that bad in A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints.

What examples pop out for you of people who, in your eyes, have gotten better?"
4,"Things you didn't notice about movies until they were pointed out to you Are there any things about movies (be they movie goofs, easter eggs, actors you didn't notice made cameos, etc.) that you didn't notice about a movie until they were pointed out to you?

I didn't realize, in the scene where Freddie breaks up with Paul in Bohemian Rhapsody, that's it only raining on whoever's in the shot. Look at the scene again:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNTkowt2MvU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNTkowt2MvU)

When Freddie's in the shot, he's the one getting rained on and Paul doesn't look like he has a drop of water getting on him. The only time he looks like he's getting wet is when HE'S in the shot. And, when it's just Freddie, you can tell it's not in the raining in the background, just on Freddie.

Considering I saw this movie in theaters, I'm surprised I didn't notice it, though I think I didn't recognize it because I was just thinking, ""Really? They're doing a dramatic scene in the rain? Are they serious?"" That's just really cliche, even for this movie. I think that's why I didn't notice the rain that's only pouring down on the actors and nothing/no one else."
4,"Oscar Nominations You Don't Agree With Are there any Oscar noms you don't agree with, whether or not they got nominated?

Well The Boss Baby being nominated for Best Animated Feature is one, though that's always been a category the Academy unfortunately doesn't take seriously.

Of all noms Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 did get, I'm not sure I agree with Best Visual Effects, because I found the visual effects to be so-so. A lot of the SFX in the movie looked great but the scene where Drax was flying through space looked half assed, the scene where the blue goo from Ego was attacking all the planets looked like something out of a Syfy Channel Original Movie, and the green screen effects in the scene where Peter and Ego were playing catch were pretty bad, it literally looked like something out of an old 60's movie (weirdly the set that was behind them looked great by itself, it's just that it didn't look like they were really there, the set looked like it was added in behind them in post).

If anything, I would've nominated it for best production design, best make-up, or maybe even best cinematography instead.

Speaking of Chris Pratt, I don't really agree with Passengers' Best Production Design nom. The Production Design in that movie wasn't bad at all but it wasn't anything special, it was just a generic spaceship out of Star Trek, there wasn't anything unique about the look of the spaceship compared to other spaceships I've seen in sci-fi films.

Also I don't agree with Arrival being nominated for Best Cinematography. I liked the movie, a lot actually, but the cinematography was the weakest point to me. The movie's lighting was way too dark, it was hard to see things at times, even on the big screen, where the lights around me are turned off, and it admittedly kind've effected my feelings towards its cinematography as a whole. I'm  sorry but if I can only slightly see what's going on with the lights off, imagine what the movie would look like if I saw it at home and the lights were on?

&#x200B;"
4,"Is having good enough songs enough for you to recommend a musical? Honestly good songs CAN help a musical but, to me, it's not really a deal breaker. Though that's probably because I'm not a huge fan of musicals.

I don't hate musicals but if a story is bad or badly told, or the characters aren't likable and/or interesting, or the themes aren't explored well, or the production design isn't good, or if it fails at any other film-y (or, if it's a play, storytelling and/or theatrical) thing, I just can't get into it, no matter how good the music is. To me a musical has to have good music and I have to give a shit about what's going on when people are just talking. If the movies go on auto pilot during the talking bits, I just can't bring myself to like it personally. In fact there are many popular musicals I don't like (Grease and Rent come to mind) because of how poorly written the talky bits are.

Of course that's not to say I will hate every musical that doesn't have an amazing story. I didn't like Mamma Mia 1 because there was little to no plot and most of the singing and staging of the ABBA covers were really bad but Mamma Mia 2, even though it still lacked a plot, was surprisingly okay. The singing improved and the way the musical scenes were filmed and the choreography and staging just seemed to have more energy put into them than the first movie did. And Xanadu is one of my favorite so bad it's good movies because of how weird and incompetent the writing and filmmaking is, even though the soundtrack is legitimately good.

Of course there's also the Into the Woods movie, which has a good story but it fails as a movie because it has expensive looking production values yet it's staged and filmed like a goddamn stage play, which really kinda runs it.

What are your thoughts on this matter?"
4,"Actors you think are overhated Are there any actors you think get more hate than they really deserve?

Don't see why people hate Josh Gad so much. Yeah he's usually saddled with annoying characters but he was great in that otherwise terrible Ashton Kutcher Steve Jobs biopic and, for almost saving that film, anything else he did is forgiven. 

I will say, from the one episode of The Comedians I saw, he was miscast in that. When I heard the premise was about an old school comedian butting heads with a raunchy comedian, I thought him and Billy Crystal were gonna play fictional characters. When I saw it was a mockumentary of them playing themselves, I thought, wait, Gad's a raunchy comedian? From that one episode, the answer is no, not at all. The most raunchy thing he did all episode is make a penis joke. I'm pretty sure Billy Crystal has said dirtier jokes than that."
4,"Movies you're surprised got the Rotten Tomatoes ratings they did Are there any movies you're surprised got high (or low) Rotten Tomatoes ratings because they either looked wonderful or didn't look that good?

Even with Stephen Merchant directing, I'm surprised Fighting With My Family got a 91% on Rotten Tomatoes. Not only do WWE film's other movies, at least their wrestling based ones, have not gotten good reviews in the past, but it just looked average. It didn't look terrible but, considering WWE's track record, I wasn't getting my hopes up. So it kinda shocked me the studio that made No Holds Barred and The Flinstones Meet the WWE or whatever it's called managed to make a movie critics liked.

Then again I guess most people agreed with me that the movie looked average and uninteresting because I haven't heard many people talk about it, the only hype I saw for it was the Rotten Tomatoes ratings."
4,"About This is Me from The Greatest Showman As a song on its own merits, it's a very catchy song and one of the better songs in the movie. And Keala Settle has a lovely voice and the sentiment is nice and all but, in the context of the movie, the song doesn't entirely work because, well, the song's being given to characters the audience barely knows.

Really, who are they? Yeah, we see them being harassed by people for their looks or made fun of by their own co-workers and even family and that's sad and all, I'm not going to lie, but, still, it seems kinda weird that they literally call a song called ""This is Me"" to characters we know nothing about except for their looks and that people make fun of them. 

Seriously, what is The Bearded Lady's personality? What is The Tall Guy's? What is the Fat Guy's? Goddamn what is even Zendaya's and her brother's personality? We know they want to be accepted by society (and Zendaya wants to fuck Zac Efron but can't because of social/racial pressure) but that's literally all we know about them, that's not really enough for them to sing a song that's called This is Me! 

Contrast this with Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame or Hairspray, Quasimodo and every Black Person in those musicals were also facing discrimination and prejudice and wanted to be accepted but they had personalities and even character arcs outside of that, their personalities weren't just them wanting to be accepted by society so, when the movie shows these characters we get to know being discriminated against, it's more effective outside of just ""Audience, remember, this is wrong!""! Why couldn't they do the same goddamn thing for The Greatest Showman?! 

It's really what killed the movie for me, it seems so disingenuous, like the filmmakers didn't actually care about making a pro-diversity/anti-prejudice movie, they just made it that at the last second so they could capitalize off of the woke crowd and try to cover their tracks over the whole glorifying P.T. Barnum controversy, as if to say ""We're not pro-exploitation, SEE, we think diversity is good and making fun of others for being different is wrong! We even got a self-empowerment song about it!""

And, listen, if you like the movie because you like the songs and like it as just a fun spectacle, I totally get and respect that. What I don't understand are people who like the movie because ""it has a good message"". How could the message have possibly been effective to them when the movie doesn't let us get to know the people the message is centered around? Was a self-empowerment ballad or two and characters repeating ""don't judge everyone for being different"" really enough for them? What happened to movies where even the casual audience member judged a movie for its characters? Or, if you did like the troupe, what did you see in them? What personalities did they show throughout the movie that I just missed? 'Cause I just don't get it...

But I just wanna discuss this, did the troupe have more character than I'm giving them credit for? Or is a self empowerment ballad really enough for you to say ""yeah, the message was effective""? I'm not gonna make fun of you, I just wanna know..."
4,"Movies that feel like a combination of other movies Are there any movies you can say feel like a combination of other movies?

The Greatest Showman can basically be described as taking the visual aesthetic (editing, lighting, choreography, etc.) of Moulin Rouge, mix it in with the saccharineness and simplicity of Patch Adams, where you take a real person and turn him from a complex figure to a man who just wanted to entertain but the big bad establishment won't let him, and then mix it in with Gene Belcher's musical about Topsy the Elephant, where a man whose horrible deeds are instead portrayed as a good thing (Thomas Edison going from killing Topsy the Elephant to saving and falling in love with her for Gene's musical and P.T. Barnum going from a man who made a business exploiting physically disabled people and abused them behind scenes to a man who kinda sorta exploited physically disabled people but it's a-okay because his business ended up empowering them and helping people see them as equals)."
4,"Movies that were obviously a famous director, actor, producer, etc.'s attempt to bank off of a more successful film What are some obvious examples of that?

I'm pretty sure Pixels was just Adam Sandler attempting to make his own big action comedy film seeing as their popular now. It especially felt like he was trying to make his own Guardians of the Galaxy, what with the 80's references, being soundtrack heavy, and literally having a short guy who holds a big gun and is a complete ass. 

And the DCEU has basically made a career off of trying to be like Nolan at first and now like the MCU. They haven't even really stopped and started doing their own thing, Aquaman felt like an underwater version of Black Panther to me.

What are some examples to you?"
4,"Aspects of movies people were afraid of that ended up being the best things about the movie Are there any things about movies people were afraid of that made movies look stupid that ended up being the best thing about the movie, whether or not the movie was great?

Boss Baby. I remember people thinking it looked stupid because ""a movie about a baby whose a businessman and he has a deep voice, what?""

Turns out Baldwin's performance was the best thing about the movie and the movie sucked for other reasons. Sure it's a one joke character but it almost works because Baldwin gives the same type of performance in that movie that he'd give in, oh, Glengary Glenn Ross and takes it seriously instead of phoning it in because, oh right, he's playing a talking baby.

Really the movie ends up sucking because the plot is weird and the movie doesn't make it clear what's supposed to be in that kid's imagination and what's real, the talking, too smart for their own good babies are the least of the movie's problems."
4,"Actors who are wrong physically for the characters but give good performances Was there any time where actors look completely and utterly wrong for the characters they're playing but give good performances?

A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints is really guilty of this

Shia Labeouf as a young Robert Downey Jr.?

Channing Tatum as a young Eric Roberts?

Rosario Dawson as a much older version of Melonia Diaz, even though she's only 5 years older than her?

Robert Downey Jr., Rosario Dawson, and Eric Roberts all playing characters who are the same age?

Chazz Palminteri and Dianne Wiest as characters so old they're Shia and Robert's parents but supposedly look more like their grandparents even though they honestly look believable as their parents?

But they all give great performances, even if they don't look the parts they're supposed to be playing"
4,"Movies you used to like as a kid but then realized were awful later on What's a movie like that for you?

Epic Movie

When I was 14, I saw it in the theater and laughed my ass off. I loved it so much I bought the DVD, watched the unrated cut, and realized it sucked.

Then I saw Meet the Spartans in theaters and thought it sucked too and realized that I just kinda grew out of Seltzerberg's style of humor. I didn't even see Disaster Movie in theaters, I just saw it on the internet, and I didn't even bother with Vampires Suck or most of their VOD work, except for Superfast, which was better than most of their movies but pretty forgettable..."
4,"Movies that are awful but compared to other movies that are similar that are even worse Are there any movies that aren't any good but, compared to movies like it or other movies in the directors/actors/filmmakers/work, what have you aren't so bad by comparison?

Date Movie is an awful movie but, compared to some of Seltzerberg's other movies, it's not quite as bad. It at least tried to parody romantic comedies. It did have a lot of random parodies of things that were popular at the time but it also did parody a lot of romantic comedies as well, it just did it terribly. Plus Date Movie at least parodied movies that were more than 2-3 years old. Starting with Epic Movie, Seltzerberg just stuck to parodying stuff that came out within a couple years after the ""movie"" in question came out and they just parodied whatever the hell they wanted to.

I will say Superfast, the only movie they've made that I've seen since Disaster Movie, is the same thing. It's not good at all but it at least tried to stick to being a parody of The Fast and the Furious movies, it just wasn't a very good one.

Not only that but Date Movie is their least ugly movie seeing as it mostly parodies movies that are somewhat grounded in reality. Sure there are cheap looking scenes (the Cat Pooping scene comes to mind) but, because they mostly don't parody fantasy movies like Epic Movie or Meet the Spartans did, the production values of Date Movie for the most part look like something out of a real movie rather than a bad Youtube skit like Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, and Disaster Movie do."
4,"Movie premises that were done terribly the first time around and then executed well later on Are there any movies that terribly executed their premise but then another movie with a similar plot executed it much better?

Date Movie is a parody of romantic comedies but it doesn't really say anything about the genre, it's just a bunch of scenes of the cast recreating well known scenes from romantic comedies and then doing something gross at the end (e.g. we actually see The Cat from Meet the Parents take a giant dump or The Basketball Scene from Along Came Polly ends with someone spitting out hair).

They Came Together and Isn't it Romantic? also parodied romantic comedies but instead of just going ""LOL wouldn't it be funny if Bridget Jones was actually really, really fat? And she danced and tried hitting on men and they killed each other whenever she tried to do something ""sexy""""? they actually parody cliches found in romantic comedies and do a pretty damn good job of it even if, as movies, they aren't PERFECT but definitely better than Date Movie.

What's your pick for a movie whose premise was executed terribly the first time around and then another movie came out with a similar premise and did a much better job at telling the story?"
4,"Movie roles that were obviously written for someone else Have you ever watched a movie and it really felt like a character was written for someone but they passed on it and another actor ended up being in it?

Kevin Bacon's character in R.I.P.D. comes to mind. With the Boston Accent, The Leather Jacket, The Haircut, and The Asshole-ish Attitude, I feel like the Director had Denis Leary in mind for the role but he passed for some reason. Doesn't help Bacon and Leary are about the same age.

Also I wouldn't say he was considered but there's no way Tommy 'Tiny' Lister didn't audition for Shogun in The Last Dragon. Big, scary black man that screams a lot? He definitely got an audition for that role if nothing else. The actor who plays him even seems to be doing an impression of Lister at times, even though the movie came out when he had, like, 2 things on his resume!"
4,"Movies that were obviously self autobiographical Are there any movies that may not have been advertised as being based on the director's life (ala Roma) but you could tell were based off their life just by watching them?

Cafe Society

A man whose really successful in the Hollywood business dating and then marrying a much younger woman who happens to have some relation to a family member of his? Gee, why does that sound familiar? I'm sure considering Woody Allen directed it, it's just a coinkydink.

Weird, though, how the May/December Romance is actually portrayed as a bad thing in the movie. Makes you wonder if Allen has regrets over Soon-Yi or he's afraid she's cheating on him or something."
4,"Movies that were hated then became popular and then become hated again due to how popular they were Bohemian Rhapsody

Critics had mixed reactions on it but then audiences started loving it. Then it got awards nominations and now it's back to being hated again

The Boss Baby of all movies. Many people thought it looked dumb, critics didn't like it but audiences, from what I saw, were more or less okay with until it got a Best Animated Feature nom. Then people started REALLY hating it!

What are some movies you noticed went from being hated to being popular to then being hated again?"
4,"Actors you thought were younger than they actually were Are there any actors you thought were younger than they actually were either now or when they were in a movie, TV show, whatever, way back when?

I was surprised to find out the woman who played Mrs. Parker in Friday was in her mid-40's when she made that movie. No joke, she was born in 1951 and the movie came out in 1995! I would've guessed she was at least 10 years younger than that!

Also I don't know why but for some reason I find it odd that Jeremy Irons was in his 40's when he voiced Scar. I know it's only his voice being used but somehow he sounds like a guy in at least his 50's in that movie. Maybe it's just how his voice sounds in general, I dunno..."
4,"Movies that were based on something they didn't need to be based off of Are there any movies that were either adaptations of other people's work or movies based off of real people that really didn't need to be?

Dragonball Evolution. The movie has barely resembles the manga and/or anime it's based off of. I honestly think that, if it was called something else, people wouldn't have loved it but it wouldn't have gotten quite the hate it did, it just would've come and went. And, aside from the characters names and a couple of plot points in the movie, the movie would've been better off if they just made it an ""original movie"" rather than trying to make it a Dragonball movie.

The Greatest Showman. Other than being about a circus with physically disabled people in it, this movie barely has anything to do with P.T. Barnum, they literally could've used the same script and changed the names and no one would've thought of P.T. Barnum. I mean, the image of a ringmaster with a circus full of physically disabled people and people who do stuff like acrobatics and juggling and what not is not really an image that's unique to Barnum anymore, so why bother making it about P.T. Barnum if you're not even going to bother to use anything resembling his life? Yes the likes of The King and I, The Sound of Music, Pocahontas, Anastasia, etc. also didn't stick to the real story at all but at least those movies used something that was unique to the person the movie's about. Can't really say the same for The Greatest Showman.

It's basically the Dragonball Evolution of based on a true story movies."
4,"Biopics that made you wonder ""did this person need their own movie?"" Have their been any biopics that made you feel like this?

I know this movie isn't necessarily a biopic but Fruitvale Station. The movie has good intentions, don't get me wrong, but not much really happens in Oscar's life before he gets shot. I get what Ryan Coogler was going for but I feel like showing the life of someone who was the victim of police brutality would've made a better short film than feature length film, at least when their life was mostly normal and uneventful beforehand (besides the whole ex-convict thing) like Oscar's was.

Also Selena. Yes she gets shot at a young age and yes she has a difficult, controlling, even somewhat abusive father, but there are large stretches where everything goes well for this girl and, outside of dealing with her father, her biggest conflict in the movie, before getting shot, is wanting to get a boyfriend then get married. If anything, a movie about her father would've made a more interesting movie and, as is, the movie feels like one giant ""this singer gets more and more successful"" montage."
4,"Movies you don't get the appeal of Are there any movies you just don't get why their as popular as they are?

I don't know if it's really popular, and I haven't seen the sequel, but I'm not sure I get the appeal of Mamma Mia. I understand not everyone walks into a movie looking for depth so I can see why people would look the other way when it comes to its lack of a story but, as a musical spectacle, it still kinda falls flat on its face. Besides Amanda Seyfried, the singing ranges from okay to terrible and the choreography is awful. Sure the songs are catchy but I just don't get why people like seeing them when they're being sung terribly. Sure the actors are smiling and looking like their having fun while their singing but is that really enough for people?

Don't get me wrong, if you like Mamma Mia, you do you, I just don't get it, that's all..."
4,"Actors you were surprised to see in certain movies because you had no idea they'd be in them Has this ever happened to you? Have you ever been surprised by an actors appearance in a movie because you didn't know they were gonna be in it beforehand?

I was surprised to see Kevin Spacey as The Murderer at the end of Seven. I saw the movie years after it came out but I had never heard that he was in it

There've been a few movies David Krumholtz has been in and I didn't know until after the fact. I had no idea he was in Superbad, Walk Hard, or I Love You, Man until I saw those movies on his IMDB page and I've seen those movies

Voice-wise, when I was a little kid and heard Eddie Deezen's voice in Rock-A-Doodle, I was surprised to hear his voice there. At the time, I was a big fan of Dexter's Laboratory so it was unexpected for me to hear Mandark was in the movie"
4,"Worst makeup jobs you've seen in movies What are some of the worst makeup jobs you've ever seen in movies?

The makeup to make John Travolta look both young and old in Gotti made him look like a wax figure

The Beard The Bearded Lady wore in The Greatest Showman looked like something they picked up at Party City. The other troupe members looked fine though (except for The Three Legged Man, whose leg looked so fake most of the scenes hid it, making it seem like he was just a random guy hanging out at the circus, and Tom Thumb, but that's more bad CGI than bad makeup)

The wig Woody Harrelson wore in Venom also looked like something they got out of a costume shop

Beastly might win the award for worst makeup though. It's a movie about a shallow kid being forced to learn that beauty is on the inside and he's supposed to be so hideous his father has to home school him. So how do they make him ugly? By giving him tattoos and some scars. Yeah, I've seen way uglier people in schools than just scars and tattoos

Also Jill in Jack & Jill. Adam Sandler just put on a dress, a wig, and fake boobs and that was enough for him to look like a ""woman"". Doesn't help he barely tries to sound like a woman. It almost makes me appreciate Norbit, say what you want about that movie, at least Eddie Murphy tried to look and sound like a woman (albeit one with an obnoxious voice) and the makeup to make him look like a fat woman was at least somewhat convincing. Not Academy Award nominee good (despite actually being nominated for an Academy Award) but still..."
4,"Animated characters who look like their voice actors Anyone got any examples?

Of all the Ice Age characters, Denis Leary looks the most like his character, Diego the Tiger. Which is weird because, personality wise, Diego might have the least to do with his actors' regular on-screen persona as, from the few Ice Age movies I've seen, he's more just passive aggressive than really, really angry like Leary's persona is

Also John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman look like their Wreck-it Ralph characters

And, obvious example out of the way, everyone in Shark Tale besides Jack Black"
4,"Movies where most of the acting is horrible but there are a couple good performances that get through Are there any movies you can think of off the top of your head that's like that?

The Last Airbender-99% of the performances in that movie are horrible. I don't even think Dev Patel is that good, he's a good actor most of the time but in this movie he either shouts or whispers, like an Indian Eddie Redmayne. But Shaun Toub is genuinely good as Uncle Iroh, he's the only actor who feels like he's trying to create a character rather than just say his lines in a flat, emotionelss tone or, in the case of Dev Patel and Aasif Mandvi, be super over the top

Also All Eyez on Me-The guy playing Tupac is good and the girl playing Jada Pinkett Smith isn't half bad either. Problem is everyone else sucks, with the guy playing Suge Knight and the lady playing Tupac's mom especially sticking out for giving bad performances. Then again, while the script isn't great, everything around the script makes the movie even worse. The cinematography and production design really feel like something out of a BET miniseries rather than a theatrically released movie. Say what you want about Bohemian Rhapsody feeling like a TV movie, at least it LOOKED like a theatrically released movie and the acting ranged from pretty good to competent, even if the script was reminiscent of a TV movie. All Eyez on Me is written like and looks like a TV movie and the majority of the performances in that movie definitely don't help matters! "
4,"Movies that are more popular in one country than they are in another Are there any movies that aren't that popular in one country but are popular in others?

The Ice Age and Transformers films are big in Europe but, in the United States, most people got tired of them a long time ago (although judging by the box office receipts of the last Ice Age and Transformers films, even people overseas might be getting tired of them).

Also Zootopia did get a 98% in the states and made $345 million dollars but it's basically just another Disney movie here. In China and Japan, though, it was huge, getting its theatrical run extended, having even the Chinese army talking about it, having children want animals who were the same species as the characters their pets, it was basically treated like Frozen there. And even though Disney stopped producing merchandise for Zootopia here a long time ago, they still produce merchandise for it there, including a video game and they just recently announced their opening Zootopia Land in Shanghai."
4,"Two movies with similar premises where one movie does its premise way better than the other one does Are there any movies that have similar premises but one movie does said premise better than the other one?

It's a funny coincidence that Wonder came out around the same time as The Greatest Showman because both movies are made for a similar audience and have a similar moral but Wonder does said moral better than The Greatest Showman does

One movie is about and the other movie has a subplot where a physically disabled person (or group of people) are being mocked by the normies and, as a result, need to learn self-confidence to learn that, just because they are different, it doesn't mean they aren't any less worthy of respect as everyone else

Nice message and all but Wonder does a way better job of conveying that message than The Greatest Showman. Sure The Greatest Showman has multiple songs and speeches about how the circus troupe should accept themselves for who they are but they don't have much characterization beyond ""sad physically disabled people that mope about how people don't like them"", even when it comes to Zendaya, the pretty one who's not even physically disabled, she's just lumped in with them because she's black

With Wonder, the message works better because the movie doesn't just say that Auggie is a person, it PROVES it because there's more to him than just ""he's got a facial deformity"". We see what his personality is like, we see his likes, we see his interests, we see what his relationships to his family is like, sure the main plot and conflict revolves around him accepting himself despite society mocking him but he's shown to have an actual life outside of his face while the troupe in The Greatest Showman's personalities and lives revolve completely around what they look like

And you could say that one's a musical and the other's not so they needed to make some sacrifices to have enough time to put musical numbers in. But what about Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame? That also dealt with a similar topic and had a similar message to The Greatest Showman. That was also shorter and yet it still managed to have enough time to establish that Quasimodo had other interests and personality traits other than his face. We see him falling in love with Esmerelda, we see him having that crafting hobby of his, we see him wanting to go to that festival, the movie establishes he's this sweet guy. If The Hunchback of Notre Dame can make Quasimodo a fleshed out character and still have enough time to put in musical numbers, why couldn't The Greatest Showman do the same thing with The Bearded Lady and at least a few of the other troupe members?"
4,"Movies that are less than the sum of their parts Are there movies that have good elements in it but, as a whole, the movies don't entirely work?

The Series of Unfortunate Events movie comes to mind. It has a cool gothic style, awesome production design and music, well done performances by Timothy Spall, Billy Connolly, and Meryl Streep, tolerable performances by the kids, some well done scenes, and the makeup to make Jim Carrey look like different characters is well done. However the supporting characters are underwritten, especially Count Olaf's troupe, the plot is basically a spark notes version of the first 3 books edited in together, leading to the storytelling feeling rushed a lot of the time, and the movie does kind've turn into an expensive demo reel for Jim Carrey half the time. Even as someone whose never actually read the books, I can see why people like the TV show better.

Also Bohemian Rhapsody. The concert scenes and music videos are fun and Rami Malek and the guys playing the other members of Queen have chemistry but man if the plot doesn't just feel like it's going through a checklist of biopic cliches pretty much all of the time. And the script does rush through a lot of events to be able to get 15 years of material in. While the actors playing the other members of Queen try their best, it feels like the only non-Freddie Mercury band member who has much personality is Roger while the other two basically just react to what Freddie and Roger are doing."
4,"Serious moments that fell flat to you Are there any moments that tried to be serious and emotional but really didn't work for you?

The Room is basically an entire movie filled with scenes like this

Another example comes from Guardians of the Galaxy of all movies, a movie that is mostly goofy but does have a few emotional moments. But there's one I didn't think really worked. At the end, when all the Guardians are joining hands, the scene is fine for the most part UNTIL Rocket's entire hand grabs Drax's finger. There's just a massive size difference between the two that it becomes unintentionally goofy to see Rocket struggle to jump up and reach Drax and then, when he does, his hands are literally small enough to grab one of his fingers. And I'm not sure if this was supposed to be emotional or if Gunn was adding a comedic scene into what was an otherwise emotional moment (the way they play the scene, with the big, orchestral music still playing in the background while he tries to reach Drax doesn't help). I dunno, it would've made more sense for him to put his paw on Drax's leg then what they went with in my opinion

What are some examples of emotional moments that didn't work for you?"
4,"Movies that tried to have their cake and eat it too Are there any movies that tried to do two things at once that just are the complete opposite things from each other and tried to put these two opposite things together even though they don't work?

The Greatest Showman is basically Having Your Cake and Eating it Too: The Movie.

The Director himself admitted that it was a movie P.T. Barnum would make about himself to make himself look good. But he also said it's supposed to be an empowerment film with a message of how disabled and people outside of the ""norm"" should be accepted into society.

So you want to make a movie with a story that a man who made a business on exploiting people, especially disabled people, for being different would tell about himself to look good AND you want to make an empowerment film for people who are ""different""? Did no one, not the director or any of the writers, see how these two ideologies might not fit together?

The idea of making a movie with a story that P.T. Barnum (or any not so great historical figure) would say to make themselves look good might work if it was done as a parody or satire but, really, it doesn't work as a family friendly inspirational musical that's supposed to have an actual message about accepting yourself. And, to make things even worse, the message isn't even done well seeing as the movie focuses entirely on Barnum and the circus performers, the characters the message of the movie is centered around, are basically singing extras with only about a scene or two actually focused on them, which makes the message feel even more disingenuous.

It says something that this is the movie where a visual gag where Tom Thumb is shown to be so small that he can sit on a hat without flattening it is followed up with him chastising Barnum (and the audience) for treating him and the other circus performers for being different. Like, movie, you literally just made fun of Thumb for being different, you have no room to talk."
4,"Attempts at actor/director comebacks that didn't work out Are there any times you can think of off the top of your head where an actor tried to make a comeback and it didn't work out?

Matthew McConaughey was having a successful comeback earlier this decade but starting in 2016, he's kind've fallen back into old habits as almost all of his movies have been critical and/or financial flops. The only exceptions have been animated stuff like Kubo and the Two Strings and Sing.

Catherine Zeta-Jones was in a slew of nationally released mainstream movies from 2012-2013 after not starring in a wide released film since 2007 with No Reservations (including Rock of Ages, Playing for Keeps, Broken City, Red 2, among other things) but all of those movies bombed at the box office. After 2013, she's mostly done TV and streaming shows.

Warren Beatty tried to come back in 2016 with Rules Don't Apply and it was a huge bomb at the box office partly because I'm guessing most of the younger crowd hadn't heard of Beatty and the older crowd kind've forgot about him because he hadn't been acting and/or directing anything in years.

Same thing happened to his friend Goldie Hawn with Snatched but I'm guessing deciding to do a movie with hated comedienne Amy Schumer didn't help matters.

Can you think of any examples?"
4,"Are there any actors/directors who love making a certain type of film? If these people are directing or acting in a movie, 9 times out of 10 it's a biopic or based on/inspired by a true story:

Leonardo DiCaprio

Clint Eastwood

Tom Hanks

Robert Zemeckis since he's come back from doing mo-cap films oddly (with Allied being the exception)

Bryan Cranston

Steven Spielberg

Basically almost any actor or director that makes oscar bait movies all the time

&#x200B;

Also Christina Ricci sure loves doing movies that are based on comics that had their own cartoons (The Addams Family movies, Casper, Speed Racer (if you count manga and anime), and Smurfs 2 all come to mind).

&#x200B;"
4,"Movies you're surprised made as much money as they did Zoo.to.pia.

&#x200B;

Sure it's from Disney, was critically acclaimed, and there weren't many other kids movies at the time. Still a billion dollars? For a movie most of the general audience (a.k.a. people who actually influence ticket sales) wasn't talking about? And even the ones who were talking about it were mostly talking about the message rather than the plot or characters? (with the exception of furries of course...) I'm not surprised it did well but, still, the reception it did get wasn't a billion dollars good. Movies that make a billion dollars are supposed to be movies people go ga ga for or are sequels to movies people go ga ga for, not movies that people shrug off and say ""ehh pretty good, I liked the message"" then forget about the next day, which so many people did to Zootopia.

&#x200B;

Even though I know it was rated R, and not going for the same audience, considering Deadpool came out around the same time, THAT'S the movie that should've made a billion dollars because that's the movie that people were going ga ga for and THAT'S the movie that's had longstanding pop culture relevance. Since that movie's come out, I've seen people wear Deadpool hats and T-shirts all the time. No one's wearing a Nick Wilde T-shirt. The box office grosses for the two, even if they aren't going for the same audience, should've been switched because that's the more popular of the two movies and the more popular movie SHOULD be the one that makes more money at the box office because, oh yeah, that's the one more people would be SEEING!"
4,"Movie trailers that got the plot of the movie wrong Are there any movies that had trailers that made the movie look like it had an entirely different plot than the actual movie?

Little Nicky's trailer makes it look like it's going to be about the son of the Devil moving to the big city when, in actuality, it's about the son of Devil only going to the big city to stop his brothers from taking it over: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op62tf2ww5E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op62tf2ww5E)

Also I remember seeing a teaser in theaters (that I can't find on Youtube) that highlighted the whole thing where Nicky was actually the offspring of The Devil and the Angel and I remember that part of the movie was highlighted a lot in the marketing for the movie, which is odd because it's treated as a big ol' twist when the movie's almost over. Did they really think that element would really sell tickets? Why?"
4,"Common complaints that are made by people who were obviously cherry picking scenes Are there any common complaints you hear from people who it seems obvious to you were really just trying to find things to complain about and did so by cherry picking scenes even though, if they watched the full movie, that's obviously not the case?

The Little People jokes in Three Billboards come to mind. All of the times people made jokes at Dinklage's expense, they were never portrayed in the right. When McDormand and Rockwell were making fun of him, it's clear the movie was showing that Mildred was a hypocrite who was complaining about people in her town being racist when she had her own prejudices. I don't know how much more clear the dinner scene at the end could've shown that. Same thing with Rockwell, when we saw him making fun of Dinklage at the beginning, he was still just the racist cop, we were still supposed to hate him at that point.

And McDormand's ex-husband? Again, we weren't supposed to like him! Were not SUPPOSED to like that he's making fun of Dinklage! What did people want exactly? For Dinklage and McDormand to get together at the end? It's just not that kind of movie, it's a rather cynical, mean spirited movie about how revenge and anger can negatively consume even the most well-intentioned people, having a happy ending where McDormand finds her true love wouldn't have fit the tone the movie was going for.

Or did they just want the movie to ignore Dinklage's height? Because that wouldn't have made sense, the movie portrays the majority of Ebbings' citizens as bigots, of course they're not going to be nice to Dinklage."
4,"Movies that feel really empty Are there any movies that, for whatever reason, just have a very...empty feeling to you for one reason or another?

Adam Sandler's Jack & Jill comes to mind. It's unusually slow paced for one thing because Happy Madison movies don't usually have a slow pacing to them, their actually pretty fast paced movies.

Not only that but the photography is so...flat. Happy Madison movies aren't usually cinematic looking movies to begin with (The Ridiculous Six and, if animation counts, Eight Crazy Nights maybe the exception) but it's got orange and teal photography and it seems like almost every scene takes place in a low lit room while Happy Madison movies, while having cinematography that's 99% of the time usually never anything special, are at least colorful.

And the movie just really feels cheap and rushed, even for a Happy Madison movie. I don't think any scene had any more than 20 extras. There's also a Basketball scene where they obviously took actual Basketball footage and used that to show people playing Basketball. They even have Adam Sandler poorly green screened behind footage from a basketball game at one point. It's like they were trying to save so much money on extras they'd rather buy footage from actual Basketball games than hiring stand-ins to play Basketball players. It's almost like they spent their entire budget on the effects to have two Adam Sandlers being in the same room, which looks okay (although it does seem like there are a lot of times they have an obvious stand-in they film from the back whenever they have them ""talking to each other""), and Al Pacino.

It also doesn't help that this movie has both Caitlyn Jenner back when she was Bruce and Jared from Subway before he was known as a pedophile and Johnny Depp back before he was known as a domestic abuser and all around asshole. The only way the cameo roster in this movie could've gotten more dated is if Donald Trump himself showed up. Just the fact that it also has cameos from all these awful people makes the movie feel even more empty nowadays (also Peter Dante, Adam Sandler's racist friend who stopped appearing in his movies after everyone found out he was a racist, shows up as well. Again, it feels even more empty now. Hopefully we won't find out in the future that Al Pacino was a sexual harasser).

What movies just feel...empty to you?

&#x200B;"
4,"Worst cameos you've seen in a film Is there a cameo in any movie that really, really didn't work out?

Mike Myers in Bohemian Rhapsody comes to mind

Mike Myers doing a cameo in a Queen biopic, and also playing an executive opposed to Bohemian Rhapsody, is a cute idea. What isn't necessary is for him to spell it out and say ""teenagers are not going to be bopping to this in their cars"".

Also why is he putting on his Scottish Accent? He got this gig because of Wayne's World not So I Married an Axe Murderer, Austin Powers, and definitely not because of Shrek. Considering he had to put on that voice, they might as well have gone meta again and had Cameron Diaz cameo as his wife, especially if they were going to do that ""teenagers are not going to bop their head to this"" line.

And why does he never take off those damn sunglasses or stand up? It really feels like he only had about half a day to film scenes and he was phoning it in as they rushed to film it."
4,"Movies that would've been better if they focused on another character Are there movies you think would've been better if they focused on another character, maybe because the main ones just weren't that interesting?

This is a controversial opinion but Cabaret. The movie about two Jewish people falling in love in a pre-Holocaust but post Nazi Germany could've been really intriguing but, instead, that's relegated to being a sub-plot, most of which takes place off-screen, and the main plot is instead about a rather dull love triangle between Liza Minelli and two English men that aren't that distinguishable from each other other than one is virginal and poor and the other one has sex all the time and is loaded that just kinda drags along. It's not a bad movie, don't get me wrong, but I personally feel it would've been better if the sub-plot with the two Jewish people had more focus than the, in my opinion, boring romantic plot between Liza, Michael York, and some other guy."
4,"Movies that made you think...that's it? Are there any movies that, when it ended, just made you think, wait...is that it?

Vox Lux made me think like that

It felt like the movie ended way too early, it just sort've ended on another concert of Natalie Portman's and that's it. The first half is well done but, once Natalie enters the movie, the movie just sort've rushes through the plot and, once it's over, it doesn't feel like anything's been concluded, it's just kind've one of those movies that ends without any real conclusion.

When the credits started rolling, it was the one movie I sat in the theater thinking, ""wait, the movie's over?"", which I've never really felt before.

What are some movies that made you think, wait...is that it?"
4,"Movies that are popular now that you bet are going to be forgotten 10 years from now Are there any movies you think are going to be popular now but no one we'll talk about in about, oh, 10 years?

I bet Bohemian Rhapsody is going to end up like this. It seems like most biopics are only popular for a short time and, in 10 years, it might only be remembered, if at all, as the movie that made Rami Malek a movie star. I mean, Ray and Walk the Line were both huge when they first came out yet now no one talks about them. Hell Straight Outta Compton, a movie that a huge amount of hype and advertising when it first came out and one that people were complaining about when it only managed to get one Oscar nomination, hasn't really had that much longstanding pop culture relevance. Even the actors playing NWA haven't really become movie stars since. I'm gonna guess Bohemian Rhapsody is gonna fall under the same path."
4,"Movies you hate mainly due to overexposure? Are there movies like that, movies that you hate mainly because people won't shut up about them, ala Elaine from Seinfeld and The English Patient?

Usually, I'm not like that, if a movie gets really, really hyped up and I like it or haven't seen it, I have no problem with it despite the hype.

The Greatest Showman is the exception. When I first saw it, I thought it was just a really dumb movie then didn't think much about it afterwards. Then it stayed in theaters for months and people were hyping it up on social media and elsewhere and the hype just made me hate the movie's guts after a while. It's been over a year and people are STILL talking about it! You can STILL hear the songs playing over the radio. Hell just a couple of months ago, I saw it playing on TWO HBO stations at the same time and one of them wasn't the HBO channel that's in Spanish! My god, there's a soundtrack for covers of the movie's songs that just came out! Even Disney didn't go that far when it came to Frozen! "
4,"Movies that came and went from theaters really quickly Are there any movies that felt like their stay in theaters was so short that they were gone in a snap?

Well there's Jem and The Holograms and Steve Jobs, 2 movies that only lasted in theaters for 3 WEEKS. They were in theaters for so little time that it basically was all over the news how brief their theatrical run was.

There's also Oogieloves and Delgo, both of which bombed so badly they were pulled from theaters pretty quickly, the former only being in theaters for four weeks and the latter only lasting a week in theaters if Box Office Mojo is to be believed.

Dragonball Evolution and Street Fighter The Legend of Chun Li were also both in theaters for a really short time. Both of them were in about 1-2,000 theaters for the first 2 weeks and then, after those 2 weeks were up, they were barely in any theaters.

The Big Year also went from being in over 2,000 theaters for its first 2 weeks to being in only a few hundred or so theaters. I remember that even in NEW YORK it wasn't playing anymore after the first couple of weeks.

What are some movies you remember being in theaters for a very, very short time?"
4,"What are some good scenes from movies you otherwise dislike or even hate? Are there any scenes that stand out as being good in movies that are otherwise bad or even terrible?

This scene from the idiotic Chevy Chase/Nickelodeon movie Snow Day isn't great, the jokes the actors are spouting off are pretty damn lame, but the actors themselves have some nice chemistry with each other: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg6-AbLe5nM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg6-AbLe5nM)

They honestly have more chemistry in this scene than they do in the rest of the movie. It just kinda makes me wish they were in a movie together that a better script. Hell they have more chemistry in this scene than anyone does in the rest of the movie, even Chevy Chase, Chris Elliott, and any or other B-list celeb they were able to get to agree to take part in this movie."
4,"Movies that were supposed about one thing but ended up becoming about something else Is there any movie that started out being about one thing but ended up being about something else entirely?

The Rose and Up Close & Personal were supposed to be biopics on Janis Joplin and Jessica Savitch but, due to Joplin's family saying no to a Janis biopic on The Rose's part and executive meddling on Up Close & Personal's part, they both ended up being completely fictional movies (Up Close & Personal moreso).

Does anyone have any other examples?"
4,"Divisive Movies You Liked (Or Hated) Are there any movies that people either love or hate that, well, you either loved, at least liked, or hated?

I liked Vice. It's not a great movie, Adam McKay is NOT subtle about his political bias (the fact that the montage of the rise of fake news only shows Republican news outlets when there are Democratic news outlets out there that are guilty of showing their bias do exist) and sometimes his style works and other times it doesn't (what was with the random picture of the hyena?) but I liked that they were able to not make Dick and Lynn Cheney into complete over the top evil caricatures and gave them some depth (like how Dick starts as an average schlub and it becomes rather obvious he's a guy whose in way over his head and how Lynn is the one with real political aspirations but feels like she has to hide behind her husband because of the standards she feels people have put on her for her gender) and I also felt like they did a good job at making all these events (all of which happened over 40 years) into feeling like they were part one of big story rather than just a greatest hits collection of things that happened in Cheney's life, which is what a lot biopics are guilty of doing (looking at you, Golden Globe Best Picture Winner Bohemian Rhapsody).

Again, I wouldn't argue that it's a great movie but it's still a decent one."
4,"Actors who have seemingly aged backwards Are there any actors, whether with plastic surgery or not, who seemed to actually look YOUNGER than they have before?

Ray Romano kinda comes to mind. I remember back when he was promoting Ice Age 4, he had gray hair and looked every bit his 55 years of age. Recently, though, he looks like he's in his 40's even though he's in his early 60's now. In Get Shorty, I was surprised to find out the lady playing Amara, the crime boss, is YOUNGER than him because she looks like she's about 10 years older than him.

Does anyone come to mind to you?"
4,"Movies where the music (score or song) was better than the movie itself Are there any movies where the music, whether it be the score or a song in the movie, is better than the movie?

For score, The Last Airbender, Dragonball Evolution, and Godzilla '98 were all terrible but the musical scores were pretty damn good.

Alice in Wonderland 2010 and TMNT 2014 are also pretty mediocre but the musical scores were good.

Speaking of Burton, Elfman's score for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was better than the movie itself.

Also the score and songs didn't work in the context of the movie but, out of it, the score for Mac and Me and the songs were good. The director did not place them well AT ALL though."
4,"Movies that had a lot of energy yet you were still bored by Mary. Poppins. Returns comes instantly to mind.

The actors, production designers, choreographers, etc. were clearly trying really, really hard and you can tell and the movie is definitely not slow paced but I couldn't help but be bored despite their best efforts because of how much the plot was just a retread of the original, just with things slightly changed here and there (like how the animated sequence now has a chase sequence). Oh and sub-plots about bank foreclosures and dead wives thrown in. But still it really was just a remake in disguise as a sequel at the end of the day and that couldn't help but make it rather boring."
4,"Movies that look good except for one little thing Are there any movies that, for the most part, look good but there's just one little special effect or filmmaking choice that really, really doesn't work?

The character animation in all of Zemeckis's mo-cap films. The backgrounds, special effects, and cinematography in those movies look beautiful but the characters just don't look right. Monster House almost solved this problem by making the characters look more cartoony, therefore they didn't really fall under the uncanny valley, but the characters' movements are choppy and awkward a lot of the time and they also have a plastick-y look to them.

&#x200B;

Not mo-cap but the Shrek series has a similar problem. The fairy tale creatures look good and the background animation and the detail in the animation and all is well done but the humans do tend to fall into the uncanny valley A LOT."
4,"How historically accurate do you think movies have to be? This is a difficult question but here's my answer.

Most biopics are made by people who weren't there, taking stuff they heard from people who were there but are only really taking their accounts in question. Seeing as they weren't there themselves and, unless there's video or audio evidence of stuff happening, they obviously didn't see these things happen so they can really only take things from what they've heard.

Therefore all I can really say is I don't think filmmakers have to be 100% accurate to history as long as there's clearly a respect for the subjects their writing about (unless, of course, their subjects don't deserve respect). If you make someone who wasn't that bad out to be a villain and/or vice versa, though, that's a problem."
4,"Characters that should've been played by different actors Are there any characters that you think probably would've been better suited if they were played by a different actor?

I heard that, in The Greatest Showman, the guy they got to play Tom Thumb had to walk on his knees because, even though he was already 4'2, he wasn't short enough.

Now, nothing against the guy playing him, it's cool that his first major role was in a big budget movie starring Hugh Jackman and all, but, if 4'2 is ""not short enough"" and they wanted someone even shorter, why not just age up the character even more (he would've been 4 not in his 20's when the events of the movie took place) and get Verne Troyer (who wouldn't have been dead when they cast or filmed it) or even Warwick Davis? Because, as it stands, it's just kind've awkward how it's so obvious his legs are pasted onto his body, it reminded me of that episode of Family Guy where Peter made a movie and photoshopped video game legs onto Joe's body to make it look like he was running. Not only that but, because the actor's on his knees all the time, that means he can't really dance, which means the movie is always finding excuses to have the character disappear whenever big dance numbers start or even just have him randomly disappear as if Thumb has the ability to teleport (except for From Now On, where he just flails his arms in the back).

Had they just cast someone who was actually around the height they were looking for, that wouldn't have been an issue.

Or, if they wanted to cast that guy, then they should've just had him at his regular height because, umm, 4'2 is still really, really small for someone his age (the guy would've been about 22 years old when he filmed the movie), it still would've made sense for people in the movie to mock him for being short. I know they wanted to make him extremely small to make the movie seem fantastical and what not but sometimes if you don't have the money or filmmaking techniques to do things you want to do, just don't do them. For example, if you're going to have an actor on his knees to make him look even shorter in a musical, where most of the actors are gonna be dancing, then you probably shouldn't have your actor do something that's going to impede his ability to dance. Or they could've just done what they did with Peter Dinklage in Infinity War and used effects to make him look even smaller (rather than bigger) without him actually having to use any part of his body to make him change his height. I might be wrong but I doubt they wouldn't have been able to afford that."
4,"Important characters who just disappeared from movies without any conclusion Are there any characters who seemed important to the plot of the movie or just the other characters in the movie who just kinda disappeared from the movie without anyone saying anything?

A minor example but there's Finnick, the small fox with the deep voice who pretended to be a baby in Zootopia.

I say minor because he had no effect on the plot of the movie but I find it kinda weird how the movie showed him and Nick were regular con partners, pulling cons together almost every day yet, once Nick becomes a cop, the movie doesn't bother explaining what happened to Finnick. The last time we see him, he's giving directions and...that's it. You'd think Nick giving up con artistry would have an effect on his life and you'd think they'd want to show that but I guess not. Even the end having them stop over Finnick instead of Flash and him going ""Oh god, is this why I haven't you see the last week or so?"" would've been fine.

It's even kind've funny because one of the directors responded to the Honest Trailers video for that movie by saying ""Ha, that's funny but you forgot to list these characters"" and one of them was Finnick, which couldn't help but make me think, umm, you also forgot Finnick, I don't think you're really one to talk about that."
4,"Directors who were NOT right for certain movies Are there any movies who just were not the right choice for certain movies?

Chris Columbus probably shouldn't have directed Rent.

First of all, he's just such a clean cut director that he's just an odd choice for a musical as edgy as Rent. 

Second of all, besides the Harry Potter movies, he hasn't really directed a movie that really needed to rely on its visuals. No one cares about the cinematography of Home Alone or Mrs. Doubtfire, it's not what people went to see those movies for.

And it kinda shows he's not used to creating grand visuals because the way he stages the musical numbers in Rent are so boring. He basically just keeps the camera on the actors as they sing and dance and doesn't do anything more interesting than that. It says something when he begins the movie on an actual stage and has the actors just stand there and sing the first song. "
4,"Movies that are historically inaccurate yet you enjoy anyways Are there any movies that you know are not completely accurate to history yet you still enjoy them?

&#x200B;

Ed Wood

&#x200B;

The movie ignores the seedier aspects of Wood's life like his alcoholism and his porn directing career and also makes stuff up that never happened (he never met Orson Welles and Orson was fine with Charlton playing a Mexican) but it's got a great story, great performances, quotable lines, it's just a well made film, even if it isn't the most historically accurate movie ever.

&#x200B;

What are some examples for you?"
4,"Movies that weren't as hyped up as you thought they'd be? Are there any movies you thought were gonna be super popular and that turned out not to be the case?

&#x200B;

Zootopia

&#x200B;

When it not only got a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes but had, at the time, the highest gross on opening weekend for a non-Pixar WDAS film, I thought we were gonna get another huge Pixar and Disney classic but that's not really what happened. It has its fanbase and there were definitely think pieces about its message when it first came out but, despite how much it made at the box office, no one I knew talked about it much and it just hasn't had the same pop culture influence other Pixar and Disney films have had. The characters aren't icons like the characters of other Disney and Pixar films that have made about as much money are and there isn't really a scene or a quote that's been seeped into pop culture like other popular Disney and Pixar movies (it doesn't have its own equivalent to ""To Infinity and Beyond"" or The Death Scene from Up for example). It really seemed like, at the end of the day, despite grossing a billion dollars, it was only really popular with furries and critics. From what I've seen, it HAS had more pop culture relevance in China but, in America, hardly anyone seemed to really care about it.

&#x200B;

Also Allied. It stars Brad Pitt and was directed by motherfucking Robert Zemeckis yet I saw very few ads for it. I didn't even know it was coming out until a few weeks before its release date."
4,"Average movies that are elevated by their cast Are there any movies where the scripts are neither bad or good, just average, yet the cast puts in so much effort they elevate material a bit?

The Frozen Ground and Bohemian Rhapsody come to mind.

The Frozen Ground and Bohemian Rhapsody are a by the numbers cop thriller and a by the numbers rock biopic. But, in The Frozen Ground, Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, and Vanessa Hudgens of all people give great performances and, in Bohemian Rhapsody, Rami Malek makes a great Freddie Mercury and the guys playing the rest of Queen have good chemistry that almost makes up for their characters being so underwritten.

Are there any examples for you?"
4,"Genres you're not fond of Are there any genres you're just not a fan of?

Musicals for me. There are musicals I like, find average, or even find enjoyable for the wrong reasons (looking at you Xanadu) but there are just a lot of popular musicals (Rent, The Greatest Showman, Bye Bye Birdie, Grease, etc.) that I can't stand because I just can't get into the plot and/or characters, even though I'll admit some of those musicals do have catchy songs.

Are there any examples of you for a genre you're just not a fan of?"
4,"Weirdest trends you noticed in movies? Are there any really, really weird trends you noticed in movies?

&#x200B;

Here's one: animation had a weird fascination with putting adult animated characters, all talking animals, in baby strollers in 2016

&#x200B;

In Zootopia, Nick's con partner pretends to be a baby sleeping in a stroller at one point, in Finding Dory, Hank the Octopus has to hide out in a stroller and drive in it to get around the aquarium, and in The Secret Life of Pets, the Bunny hides out in a stroller at one point too. Also, in the Guardians of the Galaxy cartoon, in one episode Rocket has to hide out in a stroller as well.

&#x200B;

I realize kids love it when adults act childish and all but this is so specific and, considering 3 of these 4 things were from Disney, it almost seems like someone from upper management is living out their kinks through children's cartoons. Just saying, really weird coincidence."
4,"Are there any movies that fail at mostly everything they do but get one thing right? As the title says, is there a movie that's incompetent on almost every level but there's one thing it gets right?

&#x200B;

Mac and Me has good music.

&#x200B;

The acting is awful, the writing is terrible, the special effects and puppetry look really cheap (which is a little weird considering almost every goddamn product paid to get featured in this movie), the cinematography is ugly, there is almost nothing good about this movie.

&#x200B;

BUT Alan Silvestri's score, even though it doesn't always fit the movie, sounds nice and a lot of the songs on the soundtrack are fun to listen to."
4,"Scenes you hate in movies you otherwise enjoy Are there any scenes you can't stand in movies that you otherwise like?

&#x200B;

The Bryan Cranston scene in The Disaster Artist comes to mind.

&#x200B;

First of all it's ridiculous that someone would cast a guy they just met in a coffee shop in a big TV show without an audition to see if they were good for the part. No one would do that for any job, especially acting. I'm pretty sure that even Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, and Hugh Jackman wouldn't do that and they are known as the nicest guys in Hollywood.

&#x200B;

Second of all it's ridiculous how the movie paints it as a bad thing that Sestero didn't end up taking Cranston's offer because ""it would've been his big break"". No it wouldn't, that's not how actors are treated at all! One guest spot in a TV show would NOT make them famous. Hell we saw what happened to Geoffrey Owens, even having a recurring role in a TV show isn't guaranteed to set you for life.

&#x200B;"
4,"Make your own Hallmark/Lifetime/ABC Family Christmas Movies As the post says, come up with your own plot, title, and TV/B-D-list actors/entertainers who would most likely pop up in one of these things. I'll go first.

&#x200B;

There's No Place Like Home

&#x200B;

A cold businesswoman named Noel (Tatyana Ali) has no plans to visit her family for Christmas. Ever since she's become a successful businesswoman, she's drifted more and more apart from her family but once her Mom died, she stopped contacting them altogether, as her Mom was the person she was closest to. But, when she has to go to L.A. for a business trip near Christmastime, her flight ends up getting canceled so, persistent to get to L.A., she tries to drive there. But, wouldn't you know it, her car breaks down in her old hometown of Snowy Falls. Now, while her car gets fixed, she has to stay with her friendly, boisterous Car Salesman Dad (Tiny Lister) and her wise, maternal aunt (Sheryl Lee Ralph). While there, she not only reconnects with her family but also her old High School Sweetheart (James Van Der Beek). But once her car does get fixed, she now has to choose between her old home and the big city life, including her asshole fiancee (Jesse Metcalfe).

&#x200B;

Also starring John Ratzenberger as the kind bartender everyone knows, Keshia Knight Pulliam as her best friend from high school, Shar Jackson as Tatyana's older sister, and The Director's Kid Who Can't Act as her niece."
4,"Actors you kinda wished would be in better movies than they are Are there any movies you feel have potential but waste it every time?

&#x200B;

Vanessa Hudgens. I didn't love The Frozen Ground or Gimme Shelter but she was actually great in those movies and showed she was more talented than the likes of High School Musical made her out to be. But she hasn't really been in a great movie. Even Spring Breakers was, at best, okay. And Freaks of Nature was admittedly a fun movie for the first 2 acts but then it got really dumb at the end. I don't know if she doesn't have better offers or if this is just her taste in movies but it is kind've a waste when she does stuff like The Princess Switch in my opinion.

&#x200B;

Are there any actors like that for you?"
4,"Actors who are in movies you didn't even know they were in Are there any actors who were in movies and you were surprised after the fact either because you didn't remember their scene, you didn't notice them, etc.?

&#x200B;

I'll be honest, I'm a little surprised Brad Pitt was the hero who died by electrocution in Deadpool 2. That shot went by so quickly I really didn't notice him.

&#x200B;

Here's one all of you probably didn't notice: Edie McClurg, Grace the Secretary from Ferris Bueller, was in Frozen. Don't remember her being in Frozen? That's because she had one line. When Anna is sick and Kristoff is returning her to the kingdom, she voices the first servant who rushes to Anna's side and says ""we were so worried about you"". It's kind've a waste of someone with such a unique sounding voice if you ask me but whatever.

&#x200B;

Also Tony Cox, Marcus from Bad Santa, played so many costumed characters back in the early 80's. He was both an ewok and a dink for instance.

&#x200B;

Speaking of Star Wars, there are many famous people who got their start in Star Wars movies or have had hidden cameos in Star Wars movies. Rose Byrne was in Attack of the Clones, Keira Knightley and Sofia Coppola were in The Phantom Menace, The Writer with The Funny Hats from 30 Rock was in The Force Awakens, the list goes on and on.

&#x200B;

Are there any examples you've got? "
4,"Actors whose voices don't fit their bodies Are there any actors whose voices just look weird on their bodies?

Peter Dinklage

I don't think that really needs any explanation, I think we can agree on that one

Although I saw a Youtube skit with a dwarf eating cookies and his voice might be even deeper than Dinklage's: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjlVocelL78

As for other celebrities? Jennifer Lawrence kinda. She's in her 20's but, and I mean no offense, she has a rather deep sounding voice that makes her sound like she's in her 40's even though she looks her age. Must be why Russell keeps casting her as Moms despite that she barely looks old enough to be one.

I guess the same goes with Emma Stone and why she's frequently cast as the love interest for much older men, her voice, and not necessarily looks, make her seem more mature and an odd fit to be cast as the girlfriend of people around her age who sound much younger than her, even if they don't necessarily look younger than her."
4,"Movies that are hypocritical Are there any movies that, for whatever reason, just come off as hypocritical to you?

This is a small, nitpicky detail but, in the Chevy Chase movie Under the Rainbow, there's a joke where an old lady mistakes the dwarfs playing The Munchkins in The Wizard of Oz for children and the movie is clearly making her out to be the butt of the joke for not being able to tell the difference. We're NOT supposed to agree with her, we're supposed to laugh at her for it!

Then, throughout the rest of the movie, The Dwarfs act like children and literally do stuff like wearing pots and pans on their head while they use other pots and pans as drums and the majority of the dwarfs' personalities throughout the film is very, very childish. They basically act like unruly kids throughout the whole movie. In fact the most adult thing they do is have orgies and get horny. The movie is basically asking you to laugh at and not agree with someone for doing something the movie itself does throughout its whole runtime. Doesn't help that, at another point during the movie, one of the dwarfs gets picked up by a regular sized guy and the movie asks you to laugh at the dwarf for being treated like a baby by that guy.

It's also pretty hypocritical that the bad guy in the movie is a nazi yet everyone who isn't a normal white guy is portrayed as sub-human. The movie's portrayal of dwarfs has nothing, NOTHING, on its portrayal of Japanese, who are almost all portrayed as being something out of a 40's Dr. Seuss political cartoon, or blacks, as the sole black guy is lazy and talks slowly and mispronounces words, or women, as the movie at one point asks us to laugh at a scene where a bunch of women are about to get raped by a dwarf. There's literally no punchline, it's just the rape that, in and of itself, is supposed to be funny. Also doesn't help that a bunch of Japanese people get killed throughout the movie, which the movie basically portrays as hysterical. Yet that's also hypocritical not just because the Nazis are the bad guys but because there's another scene where Chevy Chase and Carrie Fisher find all the dead bodies and are horrified by it, which really comes off as tone deaf in the same movie where a bunch of Japanese guys are shot dead in an elevator and a non-Japanese guy says ""you didn't have to do that, you coulda just asked me to hold the door for you""."
4,"Filmmaking techniques in movies you can't stand Are there any filmmaking techniques you are not fond of? I can think of two:

-Historical biopics that are shot digitally

I don't know why but a lot of times when a movie that takes place in the way past is shot with a digital camera, something looks cheap about it, like it's not really taking place in the era its set in, but more like were watching a Drunk History episode that's taking itself seriously. It's the problem I had with movies like Trumbo and Rebel in the Rye.

-Gauzy Lenses

Whenever a movie looks like a fog has ensued the entire movie (lots of TV movies come to mind as well as lots of movies from the late 70's-early 80's as well as movies like The Master of Disguise), something about it makes it look cheap. Maybe it's because a lot of cheap movies use it."
4,"Plot holes/mistakes in movies you noticed as kids Were there any plot holes in movies so big that, even as a child, you couldn't help but notice them?

Cindy Lou Who talking to ""Santa Clause"" and not noticing he was The Grinch in the Jim Carrey Grinch counts for me. Even when I was a kid watching it in theaters, I couldn't help but wonder how she didn't notice him, especially when he showed his face to her for an entire minute. 

It made sense in the book and cartoon because there was no indication that they ever met before but, in the Ron Howard flick, she ran into him at the post office, went to his mountain, asked all the townspeople how he came to be the most hated man in town in the first place, and also convinced the entire townsfolk to let him celebrate Christmas alongside them. And he came. And she was there. Hell she, along with the other Whos, saw him try to destroy the entire thing. After all that, how can she possibly not recognize him trying to steal her Christmas tree? What's even weirder is they mention the previous events in the scene when she asks him to visit The Grinch and says that ""oh, he's not such a bad guy"". Like, little girl, you've been obsessing over this guy for almost an entire month, how are you going to ask someone you think is Santa to visit someone else and not recognize that the guy you're talking about is right in front of you?

I guess you could argue it's like when people dress up as Santa for little kids they know and, to the other adults, it's obviously not Santa of course but when people do that they usually try to put on a beard or something to make them look different so the kids don't notice them. The Grinch just put on a Santa suit and, otherwise, looks like The Grinch. Sorry but even as a kid I thought this scene was dumb.

5,"Over its 50-year history, the MPAA has rated a total of 29,791 films. (As of September 30, 2018.) [citation on Page 40](https://www.mpaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/G-is-for-Golden.pdf)



The MPAA has rated an average of 587 movies a year, with a high of 940 films rated in 2003 (near the peak of the DVD boom.) 

(Note: Excluding 2018, since full numbers are not yet available for the year.)

17,202 Rated **R**


4,913 Rated **PG-13**


5,578 Rated **M/GP/PG**


1,574 Rated **G**


524 Rated **X/NC-17**



In 2017, 75 percent of films rated were submitted by independents, compared to just 47 percent in 1969, 
the first full year of the rating system’s existence. Early on, more than half of films submitted for ratings were 
MPAA member studio productions. That has shifted over time, in part because as parents increasingly relied 
on the ratings, more independent distributors began submitting their films for rating, but also because there 
are now more independent film releases today compared to MPAA member releases.
____________________________________________________

**APPEALS & OVERTURNED RATINGS**
 
Since 1968, of the nearly 30,000 films rated, 1.4 percent have been appealed (428), and 0.6 percent have had 
their rating overturned (165). Since the introduction of the PG-13 rating, most years have seen one percent 
or fewer ratings appealed.

Historically, an average of nine films have been appealed each year. More recently, the number of films 
appealed is even lower. Since 2010, an average of five films have been appealed per year. 
 
(Note: Excluding 
2018, since full numbers are not yet available for the year. )


1984, the year the PG-13 rating was introduced, saw the highest number of rating appeals. 18 ratings were 
appealed, or six percent of the total number of films rated. 1984 was also the year with the highest number 
of ratings overturned on appeal (3.4%). 



2016 had the lowest number of rating appeals, with only one. 


On average, less than one percent of films have their ratings overturned on appeal each year (0.7%). 
There were five years – including 2016 – in which no ratings were overturned.

5,"What're your favorite quotations about (not from) movies? * Some people go to the movies to be reminded that everything's okay. I don't make those kinds of movies. - David Fincher


* Pick up a camera. Shoot something. No matter how small, no matter how cheesy, no matter whether your friends and your sister star in it. Put your name on it as director. Now you’re a director. Everything after that you’re just negotiating your budget and your fee. – James Cameron


* When given an opportunity, deliver excellence and never quit. ― Robert Rodriguez


* The saddest journey in the world is the one that follows a precise itinerary. Then you’re not a traveler. You’re a fucking tourist. ― Guillermo del Toro


* We don’t make movies to make money, we make money to make more movies. – Walt Disney


* Film is, to me, just unimportant. But people are very important. ― John Cassavetes


* Let me just pause a minute and drink in this moment. And if you film it, I’ll be able to get free refills for life. ― Jarod Kintz


* Cinema is a matter of what’s in the frame and what’s out. ― Martin Scorsese


* There are no rules in filmmaking. Only sins. And the cardinal sin is dullness – Frank Capra


* The characters in my films try to live honestly and make the most of the lives they’ve been given. I believe you must live honestly and develop your abilities to the full. People who do this are the real heroes. – Akira Kurosawa


* If there’s specific resistance to women making movies, I just choose to ignore that as an obstacle for two reasons: I can’t change my gender, and I refuse to stop making movies. – Kathryn Bigelow


* A story should have a beginning, a middle, and an end… but not necessarily in that order. – Jean-Luc Godard


* A film is – or should be – more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what’s behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later. – Stanley Kubrick


* The Biggest Mistake in Student Films is That They Are Usually Cast So Badly, With Friends and People the Directors Know. – Brian De Palma


* Although I Write Screenplays, I Don’t Think I’m a Good Writer – George Lucas


* A lot of times you get credit for stuff in your movie that you didn’t intend to be there. – Spike Lee


* People say I pay too much attention to the look of a movie but for God’s sake, I’m not producing a Radio 4 Play for Today, I’m making a movie that people are going to look at. – Ridley Scott


* I think audiences get too comfortable and familiar in today’s movies. They believe everything they’re hearing and seeing. I like to shake that up. – Christopher Nolan


* For me, filmmaking combines everything. That’s the reason I’ve made cinema my life’s work. In films, painting and literature, theatre and music come together. But a film is still a film. – Akira Kurosawa


* A Film is a Petrified Fountain of Thought. – Jean Cocteau


* My idea of professionalism is probably a lot of people’s idea of obsessive. – David Fincher


* If you have to have a job in this world, a high-priced movie star is a pretty good gig. – Tom Hanks


* I like unformed characters. This may be because, no matter how old I get, I am still unformed myself. – Akira Kurosawa


* If a million people see my movie, I hope they see a million different movies. – Quentin Tarantino


* The only safe thing is to take a chance. – Mike Nichols


* I Am Certain There is Too Much Certainty in the World. – Michael Crichton


* First cuts are a bitch for a director, because it’s been so many months and you put your trust in your editor and you’re going to see your film assembled for the first time. You look at it and go, This is terrible. I hate it. – Richard Donner


* I Hate Television. I Hate It As Much As Peanuts. But I Can’t Stop Eating Peanuts. – Orson Welles


* Casting is 65 percent of directing. – John Frankenheimer


* You see so many movies… the younger people who are coming from MTV or who are coming from commercials and there’s no sense of film grammar. There’s no real sense of how to tell a story visually. It’s just cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, you know, which is pretty easy. – Peter Bogdanovich


* I couldn’t sleep one night and I was sitting in my office and I realized that I was an independent filmmaker. – Darren Aronofsky


* Hollywood is great. I also think it’s stupid and small-minded and shortsighted. – David Fincher


* Being an artist means not having to avert one’s eyes. – Akira Kurosawa


* A director must be a policeman, a midwife, a psychoanalyst, a sycophant and a bastard. – Billy Wilder


* In the future, everybody is going to be a director. Somebody’s got to live a real life so we have something to make a movie about. – Cameron Crowe


* People have forgotten how to tell a story. Stories don’t have a middle or an end any more. They usually have a beginning that never stops beginning. –Steven Spielberg


* Film is a battleground. –  Sam Fuller


* Our feeling is that the most important thing on a set is that actors have enough confidence to try different things. If there’s stress or tension, they won’t go out on a limb because they won’t want to embarrass themselves if they don’t feel completely comfortable. – Peter Farrelly

 
* All I need to make a comedy is a park, a policeman and a pretty girl. – Charlie Chaplin


* Why Pay a Dollar for a Bookmark? Why Not Use the Dollar for a Bookmark? – Steven Spielberg


* Human beings share the same common problems. A film can only be understood if it depicts these properly. – Akira Kurosawa


* If My Film Makes One More Person Miserable, I’ve Done My Job – Woody Allen


* The first monster you have to scare the audience with is yourself. – Wes Craven


* We tend to do period stuff because it helps make it one step removed from boring everyday reality. – Ethan Coen


* Movement should be a counter, whether in action scenes or dialogue or whatever. It counters where your eye is going. This style thing, for me it’s all fitted to the action, to the script, to the characters. – Samuel Fuller


* It is the power of memory that gives rise to the power of imagination. – Akira Kurosawa


* But having a really good understanding of history, literature, psychology, sciences – is very, very important to actually being able to make movies. – George Lucas


* Cinema should make you forget you are sitting in a theater. – Roman Polanski


* I’ve reached a place that many directors and filmmakers get to, and I’m grateful for that, and I can work within those boundaries. If something comes along that is totally outside of horror, fine, but I find there’s an immense amount of freedom within the genre. – Wes Craven


* In order to write scripts, you must first study the great novels and dramas of the world. You must consider why they are great. Where does the emotion come from that you feel as you read them? What degree of passion did the author have to have, what level of meticulousness did he have to command, in order to portray the characters and events as he did? You must read thoroughly, to the point where you can grasp all these things. You must also see the great films. You must read the great screenplays and study the film theories of the great directors. If your goal is to become a film director, you must master screenwriting. – Akira Kurosawa


* When people ask me if i went to film school, I tell them, 'No, I went to films.' - Quentin Tarantino"
5,"Part of me wonders what movies would be like if the industry didn't continue to self-censor for no reason. If you can't see fit to blame the original Puritans who founded this land,  blame the Catholics.

Watch Pre-(Hays Production)Code movies (and do some extrapolating) to picture just where the industry could have/would have been from roughly 1935-1968 (and onto the now if the accompanying lingering overly-ass-puckered mentality from those years wasn't still blinding CARA/MPAA's censors' eyes and forcing their hands.)

In the main, just watch  pre-Code American movies. They're (usually) so much better than the vast majority of what's being produced in America nowadays.

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a6sudu/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Aquaman**, they finished principal photography and the move was in post production for over a year and it completely shows that. The movie looks fantastic, sound editing is incredible, the way it changes when they are on the surface and when they go under water. James Wan truly did something many believed was difficult or near impossible, he made an mind blowing Aquaman movie, big credit also goes for Jason Momoa for adding his personal touch to the character. The movie have a few dialogue issues and a few weird song choices, but the action is incredible, you cant help yourself but agree with most of what the villains are fighting for, and a variety of side characters that you will wish you can see more. As far as superhero movies goes, this does a great a job introducing the character and the world he lives in, making way for a sequel that can be more focused.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a6sudu/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/ebxuecd/)

* [Hard to choose but I'll give it to **Paris, Texas** (1984) – dir. Wim Wenders. Got to see it in my art house theatre, and I absolutely loved it. Harry Dean Stanton brings such a great performance, seemingly transitioning from a child-like adult to a grizzly and haunted man. Nastassja Kinski is incredible as well, and so is everyone in this film(the child especially impressed me) except for perhaps the French actress for Ann. Not enough time has gone for me to collect my thoughts on it or to understand the whole picture, but I know that I just watched an incredible film. My first from German director Wim Wenders, and now I’m excited to check out his other acclaimed film, *Wings of Desire*, although before watching this movie I didn’t know it was the same director that made them. Great director nonetheless. Even though I saw nothing from Harry Dean Stanton while he was alive, I've been thinking about the movie and overall just being sad about his death all night long. Great actor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a6sudu/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/ebxrrxu/)

* [**Much Ado About Nothing** (1993) - Haven’t seen this since I watched it in class and I get the sense this isn’t the most beloved Shakespeare adaption, but god did I love it. It’s looks gorgeous. The music is stunning. The overall aesthetic is the best, very summer evening vibes. It has a pretty stacked cast and Keanu Reeves doesn’t actually seem to bad in it as I once thought. I found Robert Sean Leonard a stand-out, but then I’m biased and just love his melodramatic, loud but sweet portrayal of Claudio. This film is honestly just so fun, much like the most of the cast, I just never stopped smiling and having fun. Humour and dumb romance overshadows even the more tense moments. Overall, definitely recommend if you haven’t checked it out already.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a6sudu/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/ebyfrxm/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9w65co/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [Early in the week, I saw **mother!** Was on Hulu. Curious with all the different opinions I have heard and I like to consider myself a fan of Darren Aronofsky, I decided to give it a watch. And now while I don't know if I can watch it again, I'd be lying if I said I didn't like it. It definitely was a movie. If you have a basic understanding of the Bible, you have an idea of the movie. Jennifer Lawrence was genuinely great here. Great cast with Javier Bardem, Michelle Pfeiffer, Ed Harris, Domhnall Gleeson and a weird unexpected cameo from Kristen Wiig, the cast did a real good job. Particularly Lawrence, Bardem, and Pfeiffer. Now the third act. I will not spoil it. But bat shit insane is what I will say. Not my favorite Darren Aronofsky movie, but I still dug it at the end of the day. Thought it got a lil preachy at points, but it wasn't enough to make me dislike the movie. Real solid imo. I'd give *mother!* a 4/5. Jennifer Lawrence carries this movie and she is genuinely fantastic. Even if you don't dig the movie, check it out just for her performance. Even though I enjoyed it, I don't know if I can rewatch it, but even though it might be a hard movie to recommend, it gets my seal of approval at the end if the day. Check it out. But know what you are getting into.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9w65co/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e9i0icn/)

* [**The Front Runner** - Saw it at Denver Film Festival (with a Q&A with Jason Reitman, the screenwriters and Reitman’s long-time editor following the film). I have a lot of feelings on this. It was incredibly well-directed, some of Reitman’s best work as a director for sure. It is absolutely captivating to watch. Very strong performances from Hugh Jackman, Vera Farmiga and JK Simmons, among others. I guess my mixed feelings have less to do with how good the movie is and more to do with the timing of the movie in our current political atmosphere. I don’t want to go into too much detail and spoil the movie for anyone, but the film’s central conceit of how we treat political candidates like celebrities rather than lawmakers and elected representatives, turning them into tabloid fodder with nothing off limits, is very affecting considering we actually did elect an unqualified celebrity to our highest office. HOWEVER, on the flip side, following the Kavanaugh debacle, hearing some of his sentiments echoed by Hugh Jackman’s character, it just left a bad taste in my mouth. The timing is really unfortunate for this movie, as it started playing at festivals before the first allegations against Kavanaugh came out. I will end up watching it again, because despite how uncomfortable it was to watch parts of this movie, it really was fascinating to watch. In every scene, there is so much going on and I’m sure I missed things. Really well-done film overall that’s definitely going to be a bit crippled by real life events.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9w65co/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e9imwqc/)

* [Saw **They Shall Not Grow Old** on remembrance day. Was very moving and quite a unique documentary in the sense it wasn't concerned with specific events of the war, but rather trying to bring a sense of humanity to it and to show what going through the war as a soldier on the Western front would have felt like. In some ways this is to its detriment, as it makes the film feel a little slow in that it doesn't have an overarching story line or something driving the narrative, but it was still engaging nonetheless. Technically, it was phenomenal. The footage looks amazing and it's a great contribution to cinema and history in general for this reason alone. The transition to the restored footage blew my mind, even though you knew it was coming. It really helps in its goal of trying to show the human side of what was an awful war. Highly recommend it to those interested in this part of history, and recommend it generally.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9w65co/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e9je8ru/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9s5g0z/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Harakiri** (1962) – Dir. Masaki Kobayashi. My first Samurai movie as well as my first Japanese one! Got to see it at the cinema which is just wonderful. The visual and overall technical aspects manage to leave an impression. The composition, camera movement, sound and overall built tension is just wonderful, and makes the story that much more powerful. A very powerful story about life post-war, poverty, class differences and of course, the façade of the honor of the samurai. It is filled with many aspects and themes, but also functions as a sort of revenge story about family while deconstructing all of the things mentioned above. Like I said earlier, this is my first go at a samurai movie as well as Japanese, but despite the fact that its environment and culture is all Japanese, I found the movie to be very universal when it came to the story and themes. Like many different great directors, Kobayashi uses a genre(the samurai genre in this case), to explore the human condition and human tragedy, as well as society in general. 9/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9s5g0z/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e8mb5i7/)

* [**Hope** - Man this movie hit me right in the feels, it is about an ordinary korean family, father, mother and 8 year old daughter So-won. One day So-won is a little late for school, runs into some stranger who then brutally tortures and rapes her. She gets found, brought to a hospital and from there we experience the journey of this family and how they deal with this horrific incident. We get confronted with some really tough situations, through the eyes of these three people ofc, be it the media attention the family gets, the trial, the emotional scars and healing, it can be a really depressing movie indeed. But there is also ""hope"", the film doesn't forget that even in the worst times there can be happiness found. I actually started tearing up a few times during this movie, both from sadness but also from heartwarming human interactions, it's is really good at pressing the right buttons if you will (some might call it manipulative, i think it was handled beautifully though). The acting of the main cast is great (very good child actress!), there is no flashy cinematography or production value going on but this grounds the movie and makes sure the viewer feels closer to the family. Terrific film! 9/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9s5g0z/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e8mb2hb/)

* [**The Twilight Samurai** (2002). Patched Robe. This is a wonderful film. The world building and attention to detail is similar to that of a Kurosawa period samurai film, but the story and how it presents itself, unfurls with a more understated and serene tempo. The main character, Iguchi Seibei, is presented as a simple man, recently widowed, and clinging to a meager existence while raising his daughters and elderly mother alone. He’s a man with a certain amount of secrets, but he finds his own dignity in doing the best he can, in the position he has, without ever aspiring to something higher, much to the consternation and ridicule of family members or co-workers. We find out later, that he has exceptional sword-fighting skill, which he has seldom inclination to show or prove. Things change when the sister of a childhood friend returns, whom he’s always truly loved, but has had to pacify his emotions in the guise of restraint, due to their difference in social status. This is despite the fact that their families come from the same samurai class—whose entire existence is nearing its end, right at the coming onset of the Meiji Restoration. There’s a clear allegory made between Seibei and the samurai class as a whole. His work colleagues disparagingly call him “Twilight” due to his tendency for immediately rushing home to take care of his family as night approaches—obviously mirroring the inevitable decline of the samurai as a whole. It’s so obvious, that it’s pointed out once or twice, and then you don’t even really think about it after that. There’s much better symbolism regarding a final conflict that he has to physically resolve. I’ve criticized several recent movies I’ve seen, for having a penultimate confrontation become overpowered by its metaphoric meaning rather than how it works as a story. Finally, in this film, it’s portrayed much more fluidly as an outcome of how the story naturally unfolds. It’s essentially a confrontation mirroring his own inner conflict; for his stoic devotion to rigid (and dying) social rules, and the raging maelstrom of desires buried within his own heart. This type of confrontation (both inside and out) can ultimately leave you wounded or even worse, but is necessary for inexorable change to occur. There’s several things you can analyze about this film afterwards, thematically and symbolically, but honestly that’s not what makes this film special. What makes this special is the intricate care shown in all its aspects: from the world-building, to its quiet, subdued beauty, and to the intimately-drawn characters, whose converging paths all feel like the unavoidable conflux borne from the struggle between duty, desire, and the binding restraints of a much larger social and natural order.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9s5g0z/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e8n46iv/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9iawcf/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [I was in the mood to watch something emotional and I remember seeing a post on here a few weeks ago where someone said **Blue Valentine** is a guarantee cry. Perfect. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. Perfect. The story was relatable, it was very down to earth a lot of times with movies like this one the director seems to pick a side (husband or wife) and then a lot of ""of course"" moments happen to the one not chosen. This was no such movie. Each character experienced intense emotional instability which resonates out to the audience to the point where you don't know who's right and who's wrong. While I was watching I was hoping the end would get some sort of reaction out of me. But it didn't, or so I thought. I was explaining the film to a friend after I watched it and when I was telling them about the plot and the emotional build up to the end and the closing scenes I started to get choked up. I think when I was watching it initially I was emotionally numb, just like the characters. I loved the way it was filmed mixing in past with present, joyful/hope with despair it really enriched the experience. This film was easily one of the most heart wrenching movies I've ever seen and it has some great insight on true love my favorite being Gosling's character on love at first sight ""you ever hear a song come on the radio and you just gotta dance"" it's a simple quote but in the context of the movie it had a powerful effect on me. I highly recommend this film.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9iawcf/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e6i90gl/)

* [**Lawrence of Arabia** (1962) – Dir. David Lean. I feel like it’s a better movie going experience than a film. Got to see it in 70mm which is a first time and even a first time for watching a film projected on film. Not sure if it was worth the 50$+ for the 2-hour train tickets but I do not regret seeing it! David Lean has an eye for landscape certainly, and he really relishes in the small moments of characters interactions or something as simple as showing you the wind and sand blowing before taking you to the next scene which I very much liked. I also loved the contrast of Lawrence in Arabia costume vs his British one, it really brought forth his clear duality. Then there's the way that he behaves himself, his... ""feminine"" behavior which I'm not sure what to make of. If anything I feel like Lawrence was a hero that walked the line of hubris all too dangerously, and was only 1 wrong step from paying for that same hubris, which is how I imagine it would have gone if it was based on fiction(although many say that it’s isn’t historically accurate anyway). Not to mention his (masochism?) that clearly took over at certain times. Peter O’Toole really does bring his best here, it's only my first film of his but I don't think anyone but him could have carried the main character of Lawrence as wonderfully as he did, for all its glory and epicness, Peter O’Toole is the heart and soul of the movie at its core. For all the quiet and small moments, it was him and his character that brought life to the screen! Although, it does wear most of its contents on its sleeve, even with some ambiguity on Lawrence’s character. It isn’t quite *Barry Lyndon* (which I watched at home) but the 70mm viewing is definitely worth it, without it I can imagine that a lot of the movie can feel meandering, and without the beauty, there isn’t much in it that is worth exploring for 4 hours, as fascinating as Lawrence is.  8/10. So, was it just the quality of imax/70mm or was there a lot of people(well, men) with so much wetness in their eyes that it often felt like they were on the verge of crying?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9iawcf/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e6i850p/)

* [**Badlands** (1973) — Dir: Terrance Malick. After rewatching *True Romance*, I read the score I love from that movie is fashioned after the one from *Badlands*. I had been wanting to get around to watching it, but never had as my experiences with Malick movies have been Mostly miss. This one is far superior to those experiences however. Told over lush, lyrical images portraying the vast, open range of the heart of America, *Badlands* tells the story of two young people from a small town trying to find themselves in a great, big ol’ world. Though Martin sheen is violent, you can’t help but pull for him somewhat due to his James Dean looks and charm. Sissy Spacek plays his shotgun-riding partner who comes of age along their journey. The violence depicted is stark, but not grossly lingered over. If you can overcome those moments, you’ll find a fascinating character study about youth and its complex ebbs and flows. All the best parts of Malick are evident in his directorial debut, from the striking cinematography to the effervescent soundtrack that weaves his images seamlessly along the way. I encourage all to check it out. This storyline will seem familiar to you most likely. But, akin to the point that “it’s the journey, not the destination,” you’ll enjoy every stop along this highway tale.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9iawcf/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e6igbvw/)

* [**Cries and Whispers** (1973) – Dir. Ingmar Bergman. Boy oh boy, where does one start with this film. If you think Bergman other films were bleak, then I don’t know how to describe this one, it’s like bleak on steroids if that makes any sense. It is so incredibly hard to watch and simply to much even graphically that I had to look away. It does not shy away from any graphic content and the mannerisms and dialogue of Bergman’s characters are even more exaggerated than they usually are. They behave in the most non-Swedish way they can, blunt, straightforward with no regards for privacy or personal space. Yet, there’s something that draws me to it. It is quite hard to decipher, and much like *Persona* I don’t imagine that I’ll have a clear-cut grasp of what it exactly is, but its portrayal of family misery, relationships and overall emotions and death are honest, profound and deeply touching, it makes you think about your own surrounding and relationships in general. I got to see it in theatres and I was very tired and almost sleepy in the beginning but the film managed to keep me interested and invested in the characters and “story”. I’m not sure if it’s my favorite Bergman(I think that honor goes to *Winter Light*), but I think that it might be his best. 10/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9gbw4v/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e638nu1/)

* [The best film I saw this week, by default as it's the only one, is **Crazy Rich Asians**. And honestly, even if it wasn't the only film I saw this week it would probably have been the best one I saw. A bit of context, I saw that it great in the US, people had good things to say about it on Reddit, it had decent scores across the board. That's what I knew. I knew nothing about the story at all, I hadn't seen a trailer or a synopsis of the plot. And I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, and it delivered above my average expectations and built upon them. Is it clichéd? Yes, easily. However the plot points that they go through are done with style and heart. The characters are definitely a stand out, and are really helped with a good script that allows most of the characters to have a their own personality, and the great acting allows these absolutely strange characters to transition to screen. And whilst yes there are a lot of over the top characters in this film it somehow never got over the top or tiring for me. I wasn't a fan of the main male character at first but did eventually come around to liking him. Without going into spoilers, whilst the plot is full of clichés, I think it does well to avoid some pitfalls of the genre as well. One minor complaint I have is that there is this side story that they cut into occasionally and it was good. But it felt totally inconsequential to the entire film and the film would have been fine without it. I enjoyed my time at the cinema watching this and didn't regret it one bit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9gbw4v/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e633x58/)

* [**Searching** (2018) dir.  Aneesh Chaganty. Re-friended. In Lars von Trier’s film, *The Five Obstructions*, he challenges a former instructor to remake a short film in multiple ways; each time with a different obstacle (i.e., each shot can only be 15 frames or less and so on). The lesson that emerges from that film, is that while initially daunting and frustrating, obstacles often lead to creative solutions that results in something far better than anything you could’ve ever deliberately planned. I mention this, because this film notably uses a structure similar to the *Unfriended* movies, where practically the entire film takes place solely through computer, video, or phone screens. This movie didn’t really go for anything innovative in terms of that structural limitation, but it played around a lot with the notion of evoking emotions by the simple act of watching words type across the screen. Seeing little pauses, or furiously writing things out and then quickly deleting them, trashing certain things, or momentarily hovering over clips or images, very easily managed to convey what particular emotions someone was feeling without any spoken dialogue. A big part of that, is because we’ve all spent a lot of time on the computer ourselves, so we've felt a lot of similar things during moments of anger, shame, sadness, or regret. That was a wonderful little touch, and was a limitation that the film managed to adapt into something unique. Another creatively built segment (which will probably remind you a bit of *Up*) was the opening montage made up of a bunch of cheesily-made, home videos. I’m not going to comment on the various twists and turns of the plot, because a lot of the drama comes from the entire arduous journey that the father, David Kim (played by John Cho), has to go through in his obsessive search for his missing daughter, Margot (played by Michelle La). On a side note, John Cho seems to be in a lot of quality stuff lately, and I don’t know if it’s just coincidental timing, but he’s also part of this sort of “Asian-chic” that’s currently happening, with a lot of high-profile films starring Asians and Asian-Americans all released around the same time. Anyway, he’s solid in his role, as is the daughter Michelle in the limited time she’s given. Also good, is the role of the investigating detective, played by Debra Messing, and David's goof-off, stoner brother, played by Joseph Lee. Perhaps some may question the directions the story eventually takes, but I think for the vast majority of the film, it easily manages to transfix you the entire way, as we gradually learn more and more about the unseen part of Margot’s inner life--whose captured life fragments, remain scattered across the internet like haunted digital artifacts. This probably owes some debt to films like *The Searchers* and *Hardcore*, and definitely to the *Unfriended* series, but it managed to cleverly convey its emotional connections and story through the creative manipulation of its unique, structural limitations, to the extent that it ended up feeling much more like an asset than a hindrance.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9gbw4v/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e64evgs/)

* [I got around to watching **Gone Baby Gone** after having it in my watchlist for awhile and was very impressed. The film is dark and messy and full of tough decisions. Watching some of the early scenes in Helene's house and just seeing how horrid it is, along with the looming presence of the crime that's been committed there is incredibly atmospheric. The gut punch of the second act between the botched exchange and then the unspeakable horror that was the crack den is so well executed at, subverting expectations, all leading towards the twist that sets up the third act. And the note that the film ends on, one of the most challenging questions a film has posed to it's viewer. Sure there are films that objectively end worse, with characters who commit greater horrors, or settings left in greater disarray, but something about the irreversiablity of Patrick's decision seems all the more bleak. Definitely recommend, fantastic cast, riveting plot, and gritty direction.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9cf0vd/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e5a9ab6/)

* [Only got to see one film this week, but it was a good one! **Chinatown** (1974) — Dir. Roman Polanski. It isn’t until towards the end you start understanding what the “point” of *Chinatown* is. It is unlike any other detective “noir” that I’ve seen. Its R rating allows it to have a screenplay and portrayal of violence without holding back anything. It tells a brilliant story about corruptions, and how the wealthy and powerful have to much power and influence, and no moral guideline to go with it, which obviously hurts the guys at the bottom. But one thing in particular that caught me, much like in *Rosemary’s Baby* which is the only other Polanski that I’ve seen, this movie deals with the subjugation of women. It doesn’t hold back on that front and not only tell about the incestuous sexual violence done against these women, but doesn’t hold back on showing the violence against them either. That very tragic ending with the line “Forget it Jake, it’s Chinatown”, reinforcing the fact that the same thing happened in the past with Jake, and that he will always remain powerless to stop it in the face of all the corruption… The ending is not nihilistic per se, much like *Rosemary’s Baby*, it shows it how it was and doesn’t hold back, it just so happens it used to be (and to a degree still is) a very dark reality. 9/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9cf0vd/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e5acmoc/)

* [**Call Me By Your Name** (2017). Finally got around to seeing it for a second time (at home this time) after my initial viewing late last year at the local theatre. And I’m glad it held up as one of my favourites from the last few years. While the portrayed relationship and affection is between two men it’s more on the development of a relationship at that age than it is about the homosexual aspect of it. Ofcourse that aspect adds something to the story, but its strength lies in the wonderful chemistry between the two main characters growing closer together. The comradery and sensuality between them felt very sincere, and it was a joy to see how the interaction between them constantly changed in its dynamic but inevitably becomes more raw and honest. Besides the fantastic acting of both Chalamet and Hammer the supporting roles are filled in greatly aswell. I was once again very touched by the speech near the end of the film by the main characters father (played by Michael Stuhlbarg), even while I knew what was coming. The sentiment of this speech is wonderful on its own, but also lays bare the attitude both his wife and himself have when it comes to the development of their son. They are definetely his parents and there for him, besides that he’s his own person and free to find out what  is out there for him. Loved the soundtrack aswell, and the beauty of Northern Italy is a great lovation for this story to take place.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9cf0vd/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e5adsm1/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9ah9h9/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Sunset Boulevard** (1950) – Dir. Billy Wilder. One will be quite surprised if you come in expecting a comedy, at least that’s my experience based on the only other Wilder picture that I had seen, *Some Like It Hot*. No no, in fact, despite its comedic and lighthearted moments, it’s quite a tragedy, a sad sad tragedy that is quite devastating. The downfall of the biggest silent era star(or so she thinks of herself) and the struggle of a screenwriter trying to make it, or at least survive. A very dark look into Hollywood and those involved with it, very fitting that Buster Keaton had a cameo in there(as much as it pains me to say it…). It's an example of great writing, funnily enough. Characters all fleshed out with their own needs and wants, and their trajectories coincidently aligning into what turns a very weird and uncomfortable 3/4 way relationship angle, with the main focus of the tragedy Norma Desmond. The best testament to its writing is the fact that after all Norma did, I felt bad for her, she needed help. Even knowing what’s to come at the end, I felt shocked and sad at what had happened. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I favor her over Joe, who was very opportunistic and manipulative, and instead of being a man and making a choice, he decided to tango between two worlds, until the very end. But at the same time, I can’t really blame him, he wasn’t horrible, just caught in a really awkward situation in an awkward time in his life that could never have had a happy ending. Billy Wilder doesn’t shy away from the darkness of Hollywood, it’s almost like he’s condemning them. Here’s that young girl that you build up until she got to the top of the world, gave her a taste and then abandon her to die, her along with many other great directors and actors. A great picture from when they were bigger(I say as I watch this on my computer screen…) 9/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9ah9h9/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e4vkuub/)

* [I saw the new 4k restoration of **2001**, which was my second time seeing it in a theater this year. The last time was the previous version (which still looked really great, there's never been a bad *2001*), but this new 4k version is certainly a step up. Some shots look more or less the same, but any time there's a close or medium shot the uptick in clarity is very noticeable. The earth's oceans during the blue danube sequence had a much deeper, which felt like a more natural and less tinted look (several scenes during Dawn of Man also seemed more natural and less ""tinted"") and Dave's red spacesuit in the bedroom scene seemed more striking. The stargate sequence also seems to ""glow"" more. There were a lot of little random 2 or 3 second shots I'd never really noticed before but the clarity kind of made me go ""oh, huh"", like whenever there's a closeup of someone flipping a switch or picking something up. The sound mix also seems to have gotten a punchup, and I noticed several sounds and musical cues I hadn't before. I never noticed oldest Dave having the same deep breathing as when his pod first arrives in the bedroom, and that jumped out at me, as did the first low hum of the music when he reaches out toward the final monolith. Overall, they did a fantastic job on the restoration and anyone who's looking forward to the 4K Blu-Ray has some good stuff to expect. I was actually a little distracted from the movie itself because I was just so into picking out all the shots and sounds I hadn't noticed before, but *Space Odyssey* is always a fun time at the theater and I hope I can catch it again in this format over the years. I had been worried from this trailer: https://youtu.be/Kz4lCYPBD7E that they would try to modernize the look or mess with it, but every upgrade felt very true and thankfully it was just a janky trailer that didn't really represent the new version. They done good with it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9ah9h9/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e4wbv3r/)

* [**The Rider** (Chloe Zhao, 2017) - Inner Tempests. The opening shots of this film—of a horse shown in detail—suggests the raw, raging, strength of creatures so filled with vigor that they seem perpetually contained by walls, or even the very limitations of their own bodies. This film is an intimate character study of the lives of young cowboys and rodeo riders who draw strength from their riding, but ultimately know their time in the spotlight is limited. The main character is Brady Blackburn, who was a promising rodeo rider, but is forced to recuperate and take a serious look at his life and future after a traumatic brain injury. He lives with his younger sister, who has autism, and his father who gambles and drinks away most of their money. He often visits his friend Lane at the hospital, who is in a severely paralyzed state after a brain injury he himself suffered. Therein lies the contrast. These characters are so young and full of life, but are simply broken. Not mentally broken, as is usually portrayed in cinema, but physically, even though their vitality is still overflowing with the promise of youth. The winds of change are inevitable, and Brady realizes that he has to begin a new chapter of growing responsibility. Of course, he’s inherently reluctant, because the burning desire of riding still smolders inside him. The way each of these characters confront this change and interact each other, is where most of the drama takes place, but it never becomes predictable in where their journeys eventually lead. The film is gorgeously shot; often allowing for the endless vistas to help convey the inner emotion of the characters, and thus it has some of the most beautiful riding scenes I’ve ever seen. I’ve seen so many Westerns, and yet the tender way the characters are portrayed here, elevates the simple act of someone riding a horse into something extremely soulful and poetic. I was also stunned to learn that the actors were untrained. The way the director, Chloe Zhao, utilized them was not in a stylized manner that someone like Bresson would often use with untrained actors, but instead felt calm and naturalistic. In fact, the film as a whole had this incredibly serene quality to it, despite the swell of inner conflict coursing heavily through many of the characters. It seems simple in approach, yet the lyrical depths that it bares is immense. There’s a conversation two of the characters have of stepping back into a dream and riding into an unknown future--which they approach with both fear and excitement. This theme of an understated dual contrast; of freedom and containment; of the broken and spirited; is what ultimately elevates this movie beyond just a simple portraiture of a seemingly simple and lesser known way of life.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9ah9h9/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e4wid46/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/96re4b/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [A few weeks ago I made a comment on *Before Sunrise*, and this week the best film I saw this week was **Before Sunset**. I waited a while to watch the sequel just to add to the effect of the film, and I honestly love the way Linklater writes these two characters. It's just so natural and whilst I admire the way someone like Sorkin writes his characters, for me the naturalistic approach just makes the characters so much more relateable and that is key in making me believe in their dynamic. I also love how Linklater outdoes himself here in terms of the long takes and simplicity of the narrative. It really adds to the real time flow of the movie and the constant tracking as they walk from location to location indicates a ticking passage of time before sunset. The real time style of the film also draws focus to the mundane moments of human interaction such as walking to a coffee shop or going for a boat ride. Usually in movies these scenes wouldn't be here and we'd cut straight from one location to the next unless something was relevant to the plot, but in a movie like this it's those mundane moments that are crucial for the characters and the story as a whole. Overall it's a movie I don't think i'd have much interest in rewatching, but I appreciate these films for what they are. There's something so special about these films because of how normal everything is. They're literally films about people walking and talking and yet somehow it's executed in such a way that you just can't help but smile watching how this relationship develops.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/96re4b/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e42n9vu/)

* [**The Hole** (1998) Dir. Tsai Ming-Liang. Days of past futures. My first Tsai Ming-Liang movie and he’s definitely piqued my interest. Okay, this film takes place at the turn of the (previous) upcoming millennium, where a mysterious virus that’s carried by cockroaches forces a quarantine. A few residents in an apartment complex decide to stay… and that’s about it for the plot, because it unfolds very slowly, and very weirdly from that point on. A hole is accidentally opened up in the floor/ceiling between the apartments of a man and woman. It initially causes some tension between the two, but it also becomes somewhat symbolic of their pangs of shared urban loneliness. The entire film in fact, is seething with it. It’s very Kar-Wai-esque in that manner, but instead of the vibrant, neon-Christopher-Doyle-infused cinematography that’s so emblematic of his films, this is captured mostly with long, lingering, languorous (and alliterative!) shots. Oh, and every so often, a random musical number breaks out--almost entirely from the woman’s perspective. Those parts feel very Lynchian, where the sheer surreal nature of them feels so bizarrely out of place, but yet can also turn strangely poignant once you understand how they’re revealing some aspect of a character's inner reality. It’s an extremely weird and quirky romance of sorts that develops here, because it’s expressed mostly through the decaying, peeling, and leaking surroundings, as well as the surreal dream-like symbols like the musical interludes and the developing hole. For all its abstractness, the ending does feel perfectly bridged; a breaking through of metaphor and reality that also feels emotionally appropriate. The journey to get there is going to be considered a tedious slog by some, but hauntingly bizarre and beautiful by others—as it was by me, as I simultaneously watched this with a combination of both absolute fascination and bewilderment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/96re4b/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e43v7f1/)

* [**35 Shots of Rum** (Dir. Claire Denis) Rail Switching. I’ve put this film off for a long time, and I’m not even really sure why. I guess, I imagined it would represent the most boring aspects of art-house, mumblecore films but as I watched this, I found myself immediately drawn in to its slow, deliberate cadence. This is the first Claire Denis film I’ve seen, and I’m already a big fan of hers now. The story, which is entirely a character study, involves a father and daughter (Lionel and Josephine), who live a close but sheltered life. At their apartment complex is several other people who they’ve formed gradual relationships with, including Noe, a man whose attraction for Josephine—and vice-versa—is clearly palpable. They don’t seem to take these feelings any further though, because of Josephine’s close relationship and familial devotion to Lionel, who comes off as pretty lonely figure--seldom speaking, and mostly content in his lingering solitude. An air of inevitable change is coming their way. It’s expressed in a very affectionate and subtle manner, which also applies to the entire film. A fellow co-worker of Lionel—a driver at the rail station—has recently retired and feels aimless and lost without his job. Lionel recognizes this and takes pause to look at the current situation he and his daughter is at. There’s an absolutely beautiful moment, something that can only seem to occur in cinema, where a group of them, including Noe, are forced to take shelter at a bar after their car breaks down. Rain-soaked, and with their emotional barriers lowered a bit, a few of them begin to dance. This scene seems to emerge out of nowhere. Wordlessly... magically... an entire perception shift and unraveling of long-simmering emotions occurs through multiple characters during this sequence. This probably doesn’t sound like anything absolutely special, and yet when it happens, it becomes one of those inexplicable moments of movie magic; where the untold depths of the human heart is expressed solely through its visuals, and is done with such delicate beauty, that we can easily understand and feel these character's intense emotions without any spoken exposition at all. It’s like one of those select spontaneous moments of pure cinematic joy that can erupt out of nowhere in Wong Kar-Wai’s films. Several other things happen to these characters, which all but confirms that their present way of living is going to change forever. Through all this, these characters move and communicate with their own quiet pace, speaking only when seemingly necessary. This film takes its time to set up these character’s lives and the shared world they inhabit and navigate through, and as a result, it’s often very hard to predict where it’s going. At the end of the film, the combined journey these characters went through outwardly seems rather ordinary. Like Lionel, Claire Denis is also a train conductor of sorts; treading well-worn paths, and treating this film with such tender and gentle care, that it still feels new and perhaps most importantly of all: authentic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/96re4b/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e43zpzw/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/94tb6u/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Mulholland Dr.** (2001) – Dir. David Lynch: Have you ever loved every single quantifiable aspect of a movie(and the movie overall) whilst feeling completely lost and not understanding anything out of it? No? Well, neither have I… until this movie. To give some context, I have watched *Eraserhead* and later on everything *Twin Peaks* up until Season 3(that is to say that I haven’t watched the latest season yet). Having watched *Twin Peaks*, I feel like I have it just a little bit easier identifying some aspects of this movie, but overall I’m still left very confused, but in a good, exciting kind of way. Everything about this movie, and I truly mean everything is through the roof. The two main actresses are great in their roles and give a lot of depth to their characters and Angelo Badalamenti’s score not only rivals that of *Twin Peaks*, but imo surpasses it as one of the best that I’ve ever head. I don’t know how to describe my feelings about this movie as like I said, I’m very uncertain what it is about. Is it a love story? A story about identity and what makes us who we are? Jealousy? Uncovering Hollywood? Was Naomi Watts playing different characters or was there a literal world within the blue box? Or was it a dream?? Who knows, and honestly, I’m not sure that it matters. What it is for me however is one of the best 2.5 hours that I’ve seen. Every single scene, and I mean pretty much every single scene kept me engaged, because either was funny, intriguing, lovely, cute, scary or all of the above. I know it sounds like a big cliché, especially when it comes Lynch, but it feels like a weird dream, of which you can only remember moments and bits. I don’t know what to say, I almost want to scream in joy, because it’s the only thing that comes to my mind, this movie feels alive, like its own living thing. I’m sure a lot of the ideas are scrapped versions of what Lynch had planned for the TV show, but at the same time I can’t help but feel like there’s a purpose behind everything(even if there really isn’t, although we can never know). In this state of confusion and mind-fuckery(sorry hate that word but it feels appropriate here) I would usually want to read and watch about 1000 theories to try to get the hang of it, and maybe I will, but for now I’m just left with this feeling of instantly wanting to re-watch it again. 10/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/94tb6u/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e3nmlor/)

* [**The Mist** (2007)—Dir: Frank Darabont. Caught this on AMC last night and surprisingly found it really engrossing. What makes the movie terrifying is moreso the monsters living within ourselves than the ones we face outside. Not incoincidentally, “the walking dead” marathon was coming on after that, and for fans of the show, if you have not seen the movie, it will seem very familiar to you based on recognizable faces and themes. The action and mystery are emotionally gripping, and I found myself engaging more and more with the story long after the credits furiouslyrolledsotheycouldgettotheNextshow...😜 Great performances by Thomas Jane, William Sadler, & Marcia Gay Harden chews up every ounce of food stockpiled on the supermarket shelves with her performance. Interesting to note, Darabont always preferred to release the movie in black and white as a homage to “night of the living dead,” but the studio made him shoot in color as a compromise. I know they released a B&W version in the blue ray. Look forward to watching that version as I can see what he was aiming for after finishing the movie.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/94tb6u/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e3nprqy/)

* [Finally after a month off I took use again of my moviepass for one of the local cinemas, and decided just to go and see whatever film was playing at that time of the evening. It turned out to be **The Road to Mandalay**, a film released in 2016 which only made its way into theatres here (The Netherlands) this summer. The story revolves around the lives of immigrants (2 in particular) from Myanmar who've made trip into Thailand hoping for a better future for themselves. Besides it being a beautifully shot film with a personal story to tell it really hit me on a broader scale. That being the universal right for everyone to have atleast a decent way to live their lives, and how awful it has to feel like being treated as an unwelcome and lesser human being based on the place you were born. The situations these people get into are riddled with having to depend on the help or understanding of other people who's motives aren't exactly clear. It's not a film that tries very hard to envoke feelings of sympathy or some sort of sadness. But what it does do is paint a clear and honest portrayal of circumstances people can get into while fleeing to another country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/94tb6u/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e3npjce/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/92vrac/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [I saw **Hereditary** on a whim while bored wandering around town. I picked it because I remembered absentmindedly watching the trailer once and hearing that this is one of those rare horrors that one actually takes seriously. So, all I really cared about going in was that it was well-written enough to feel the price of a ticket and the next three hours of my life were a worthwhile investment. The characters initially come across a little stereotypical, so for the first portion of the film the drama following the situation the film opens with is a little standard, but engaging enough. It is the horror that elevates it. Increasingly disturbing details are gradually introduced in the form of brief imagery, sound, or behaviour that just seems... off. The way the audience is teased has a dreamlike quality - many 'wtf?!' scenes come basically out of nowhere yet feel naturally transitioned into, and lighting is used in very clever ways to induce the fear of thinking you see something but are unable to be sure. After it ended I was left with that familiar odd feeling one has when forced to wake from a poor night's sleep. It's like you've been crumpled up then spread out again. You step outside and it feels weird to be there. For someone who saw it without the bias of particularly liking/disliking horror I was very impressed, and I think that it is obvious, if anything, how hard everyone worked on this project.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/92vrac/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e397erp/)

* [**Sister** (2012; d. Ursula Meier) - A 12-year old boy quietly slinks around a bustling Swiss ski resort, rifling through the personal belongings of the resorts' patrons.  The boy, Simon, is shown returning to the bottom of the snow-covered mountain with his collection of stolen items, which he then sells in order to support himself & his older sister Louise. The atmosphere of this movie established itself quickly & effectively, & the contrasts are rich.  The lively ski resort with its international crowds versus the towering, gloomy, oddly isolated low-income apartment building Simon & Louise live in is interesting throughout the movie.  Simon's entrepreneurial endeavors are contrasted with his exasperation at having to deal with Louise's irresponsibility, resulting in some very uncomfortable confrontations. I really liked this movie, it's a focused & thoughtful look at poverty, family, & survival.  If you liked *The Florida Project*, I would check this out, there's some things in common as far as the portrayal of the cruel existence of a poor, hardscrabble life in the shadow of a bustling hub of wealth & privilege, minus the cute moments.  Léa Seydoux, from *Blue Is the Warmest Colour* plays Louise, & simmers & exudes sadness.  The ending moments caught me off guard, it capped a solid drama.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/92vrac/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e38s2uz/)

* [On Netflix, I rewatched **The Spectacular Now** and god I love this movie. It just felt so authentic and real. Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley had amazing chemistry. The beginning of their relationship felt so pure and realistic. Teller being this popular party animal and Woodley being the shy girl seems a little cliche on paper, popular student and shy unpopular student falling for each other but it really works for this movie. The supporting cast is great too. Brie Larson playing Miles Teller's ex. Mary Elizabeth Winstead playing his older sister. Jennifer Jason Leigh playing his mom. Saul Goodman aka Bob Odenkirk as his boss and Kyle Chandler as his father are all great, even if some are only in a couple of scenes. The movie also touches on alcoholism in a way, but doesn't beat you over the head with it. Teller's character is drinking A LOT throughout the movie, but later on you kind of see why he does. He's this life of the party, but beneath the party animal, you see this sad guy. He's estranged with his family. Everyone is moving with their lives and he just lives in the moment and doesn't worry about his future. Eventually, it slowly comes back and kicks him in the ass. This really did prove to me that Miles Teller is legitimately a great actor. After this, *Whiplash*, and *Only The Brave* in particular, the guy is so talented. Shailene Woodley is equally great in this movie too. Maybe my favorite performances from both of them (although *Whiplash* and *Only The Brave* is up there in Teller's case). If you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and check it out. It's honestly one of my favorite Coming of Age/Romance movies in the last few years.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/92vrac/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e38ukh2/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/90z0mm/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Magnolia** (1999) – Dir. Paul Thomas Anderson. I was a bit skeptical going into this movie. I had only watched 3 PTA’s work before this, *Hard Eight*, *Boogie Nights*, and *Punch-Drunk Love*. Despite the raving praise from most critics and fans, it seems to have a big share of its dislikes/haters. “Pretentious”, “it never quite gets to the point”, “it’s too far up it own ass/indulgent/too long” and “it doesn’t deliver on what it teases/promises” are things that I’ve often heard about it, not to mention PTA himself saying that he would cut 20 minutes from it. Having seen it now, I can’t help but disagree with this notion, well perhaps disagree is the wrong word, I can see and understand those points of views, I just didn’t feel the same way. Even though I watched it when I was very tired, any other regular movie might have just put me to sleep, let alone a 3 hour one, but this one kept me engaged all the way through, right from the start, it grips you, from the narration to the title cards with the songs and introduces characters where it demands you to be focused from 10 seconds in. Full with an ensemble cast whose story are told all at the same time, it’s a modern melodrama done right, and now that I’ve thought about it, it weirdly reminds me of Douglas Sirk’s *Imitation of Life*, although they do not have much in common in terms of characters or themes. It wasn’t until roughly when there was 40 minutes left in the movie where it finally hit me, where I felt like I understood what the director and the movie was trying to portray and say. It took me way too long(to be fair I was quite tired) but it’s obvious, just like most of PTA’s other work, it’s a movie about family, mainly the relationship dynamics between parents and children, and how these dynamics can come to form us, for better or worse. It’s about the lies we tell, it’s about how we act, about being nicer human beings, forgiveness, regret and doing the right thing. Then the frogs came down, I was confused, still am. The first thing that comes to my head(like I imagine most people) is the story of Moses and how god sent down frogs in the form of rain to punish the Egyptians, but I do not see how this biblical story plays into the story of this movie at all, but just like the characters, I just accept it after a while, and move on with the movie. (after doing some further research it seems that PTA didn’t even intend this to reference to the exodus story, but added references to it later on after some people asked him if that was what he was referring to) It's full of stories loosely intertwined leading you to think(mainly through the narrator) that these things will come together and we’ll have some kind of payoff, crazy coincidences like the ones that he tells in the beginning. It never pays off of course, but it also feels incredibly unimportant and irrelevant, because it is, ultimately a misdirection, or so I think. It always feels bad to try to reduce a film to a certain theme, to simplify it, but in the end, *Magnolia* is about family, parent and children relationships in particular and how that forms us into what we are, and how that past is never done with us, even if we are with it. At its core is Stanley who is going through the same things that most of this movie’s characters have gone through, and maybe it’s only me, but perhaps there is hope for change, even if his father seemed to shut it down quickly. Despite its ambitions, and certainly the ambitions of the director who said: “I really feel that, *Magnolia* is, for better or worse the best movie I’ll ever make”, it ultimately feels more intimate and personal than it does ambitious or epic, which is fine with me, despite it’s clumsiness sometimes. 9/10. Like many people, I know about the infamous quote of PTA expressing his opinion of David Finchers *Fight Club*, where I learned that PTA’s dad died from cancer, something that I can’t help but connect to this movie, in which 2 different dads are both dying of Cancer. You can tell that it is a very personal story to him, and I can’t help but wonder about his relationship with his father, if it’s anything like what we saw in the movie. For some reason throughout the movie I just assumed that Steve Carell was the narrator, was confused when I turned up to be wrong lol.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/90z0mm/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e2u77f0/)

* [**Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom** (Pier Paolo Pasolini) - Indigestible. There’s a type of film where the allegory is so incredibly obvious, that it’s meant to stand out and overpower the surface story. *The Seventh Seal* is a notable example of this. It’s true here in this film, but both the story and its noted allegory takes a back-seat to the still-disturbing shock elements that this film is most infamous for. Again, this is an obvious allegory for fascism and the abuse of power, and the repeated depraved sexual and violent acts that go on and on throughout the film, almost comes off as too simplified and trite. But then again, you look around at some of the developments going on in our world today, and apparently this message is unendingly relevant, and makes one wonder if it does indeed need to be told in such a basic and clear manner. The plot—what little trace of it—revolves around four men in a position of power who kidnap a group of young men and women and inflict increasingly sordid and violent acts of debauchery, torture, and humiliation to them. Overall, the directing is exceedingly well-done even though it’s such unrelentingly disturbing material. It’s well shot, lit, and staged, and the violent and sexual acts come off as very realistic, which could not have been easy to shoot or act through. The world building is exceptional as well. It takes place in a single palace, but it practically becomes its own character, with its own unique aesthetic, especially as we’re repeatedly returned to familiar rooms and places, whose often clean and elegant appearance creates such a stark contrast to the terrible sexual and violent acts that take place within them. In this, you could perhaps see a larger trace of a theme that links the environment with the human body, and the focus on anal penetration and feces. The movie *The Cook, the Thief, his Wife, and her Lover* had one of the best integrations of this type of symbolic link between an inter-connected set design and the human body, with the multi-linked kitchen that mimicked the stages of the human digestion system, each with its own separate functions. Undoubtedly, that movie was probably influenced by this movie. In art, the expulsion of urine or feces, can often be symbolic of getting rid of negativity; of the dark and unwanted portions of your life. It doesn’t look like that was really apparent in this film though, as the main intent was to hammer in the shock value, and keep its allegory front and center at all times. It also didn’t seem like this film was possibly implicating and linking us--the viewer--in voyeuristically indulging in this film’s numerous horrors of depravity, similar to what the four libertines do. I’d think for most people, the accumulated effect of all of this, actually creates further separation and distance from what we’re watching and the characters that do enjoy these horrible acts. This movie has definite historic value, and its message, unfortunately, seems to be timeless in its application. I’m not so sure, if I’d recommend this as something essential that you need to see though, since few people are going to get any enjoyment while watching it. This is a distorted reflection on one extreme end of the human condition, but it is a reflection on us nonetheless. Its message is so blaringly obvious, yet so consistently repeated and endemic throughout human history, that perhaps the only way to get us to truly examine this about us, is to bluntly and forcibly drag us through the grime and muck of it all, as this film attempted to do.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/90z0mm/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e2uv6b2/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8z353l/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [I revisited Ron Howard's **Apollo 13**. Space has never felt so claustrophobic. Ron Howard directed another masterpiece of suspense thriller, but this time in space. Howard recounts the true story of the Apollo 13 spacecraft and its crew's miraculous return to Earth. You will still be stunned by the realistic special effects and the enclosed environment. You feel like you are in the ship with these astronauts. Howard also lets you understand how hard it is for the families of NASA's team members to endure these flights. *Apollo 13* is a phenomenal historical drama that plays out more like an epic disaster film. *Apollo 13*'s cast is filled with excellent character actors that all deliver heartfelt performances. Tom Hanks, Kathleen Quinlan, Gary Sinese, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, and Ed Harris are particularly wonderful to behold in *Apollo 13*. These actors bring these incredible real events to life with a genuine quality that comes across the screen. Their emotions and desires are felt by you through these highly expressive depictions. I think *Apollo 13* is as much a display of believable acting as it is a recreation of historical moments. James Horner delivers an emotive score that grips your heartstrings with each tender note. The scary sequences are elevated by Horner's tense score as well as the intimate familial scenes are grounded by his gentle sounds. *Apollo 13* keeps you in the moment with its tense scenes in addition to Horner's classical music. In short, *Apollo 13* is a must see American classic. It may have been released in 1995, but it looks like it could have been made currently. The effects, story, acting, and direction all hold water to date. I think you could play *Apollo 13* in a classroom as a time piece of the late 1960's and early 1970's. It is that good.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8z353l/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e2fpk2t/)

* [**1987 When the Day Comes** - In the mid-1980s, the South Korean government was still a dictatorship with Chun Doo-hwan as the President.  During this time, the Korean people were calling for a full democracy and increasingly protesting for it.  The government had an anti-Communist task force executing McCarthy-esque searches for ""Commie sympathizers"", which was carte blanche to seize anyone speaking out against the current government. The tensions were high and in 1987 there was a major incident with a student which set things in motion for what would eventually be called ""the June Democratic Uprising"".  This is the story of that incident and the events that followed which eventually led to the government having full democratic elections. The movie is historically-based but goes out of its way to say it's not meant to be a documentary, so liberties were taken.  The film overall is a historical drama cut with the energy of a political thriller.  The cast of characters is in the dozens and only a few are consistently on screen, but each person's role in the storytelling is woven in masterfully so that by the end, the viewer is totally immersed in the world of South Korea 1987 and the events that are going on. It's told at a large-scale level, laying out what is going on and what events/actions are leading to other actions, but it also spends just enough time to give character and personality and motivations so that we can sympathize with many of these people... all of these people, really. The movie is really tight and engaging throughout and has a really fantastic and powerful ending. I'd recommend knowing very little about it going in, even the trailer reveals things that many of us in the United States may not know about that part of south korean history and learning it on the fly was pretty interesting and exciting. The storytelling is structured interestingly and I'll say just that the film feels like a particularly type of movie at the start but continues to grow and grow and become a very different film by the end. Yes, it does get into some melodrama at times.  Yes, it does get a little ""hollywood actiony"" at times.  Yes, it does play to sentimental tropes at times.  But it does so in a very controlled way and it doesn't dwell on those moments too long. It pairs really nicely with another recent South Korean historical drama *A Taxi Driver* which deals with the events of the student protests in Gwangju province about 7 years prior to the events of this movie. Overall, it was simply outstanding and I was blown away by it and really want to recommend this movie.  I think if you liked *A Few Good Men* or *All the President's Men* you'd really enjoy this film.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8z353l/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e2frogm/)

* [Watched **There Will Be Blood** for the first time the other day and holy shit. The cinematography is beyond beautiful, the soundtrack sounds like it belongs in a horror film but for some reason fits perfectly making for such an uneasy and dark feeling, the writing is unbelievable, there is just quotable moment after quotable moment in this movie (the milkshake scene, my god) and holy shit the acting, I seriously don't know what can be said about that hasn't already been said, Daniel Day-Lewis probably gave one of the greatest performances of all time but I feel like Paul Dano really doesn't get enough credit since he was in DDL's shadow, his performance was fantastic. Now saying all this, this movie does remind me of something like *2001: A Space Odyssey* or *Stalker* where it's definitely not for everyone. The movie doesn't have a super interesting plot line or very likeable characters but instead focuses on it's unnerved dark aesthetic, beautiful shots and interesting themes (capitalism & religion, human greed, ""the American dream"", competition & the need to be the best etc.). I definitely wouldnt blame anyone who thought this film is ""boring"" or ""bad"" but for me, this is one of my favourite films of all time. Nearly a week after I've watched it, I still find myself thinking about it and replaying scenes over in my head and to be honest I'm not even sure why. There's just something about this movie that sticks with you, I'd definitely recommend giving it a try even if you might not like it](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8z353l/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e2g57zh/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8x16cd/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Before Sunrise** - I had always been meaning to watch these films and with it being on Amazon Prime here in the UK I thought i'd give it a shot, especially since I've been writing my own movie and wanted to see how Linklater's dialogue works with such a simple premise. What I got was a movie that felt really authentic in it's execution. I love how the filmmakers weren't afraid of just letting the camera role, like when they are sat on the bus asking each other questions or walking through an amusement park. It captures the mundane nature of everyday tasks but the cameras focus on the two characters lets you focus entirely on what they're saying. I think the biggest praise I could give the film is that it felt like I actually was watching two people learn more about each other as they went on, and the types of things they discuss, as well as the way they say goodbye, is so incredibly reminiscent of my own experiences with former partners. There was no sense of Hollywood exaggeration and that grounded approach elevated the movie to something special. I wouldn't necessarily call it a great movie, and I can't see myself rewatching it, but it's something I appreciate as a realistic look into love and attraction where somehow Linklater created an enjoyable experience despite nothing much actually happening. I look forward to seeing the sequels, which at least according to reviews seem to be on par with the first film.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8x16cd/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e201vnm/)

* [**Wild Strawberries** (1957) - Dir. Ingmar Bergman. From what I’ve seen, Bergman deals mainly with 3 themes. Struggling with religious faith and god, existential crisis and death. He showcases these themes through different characters and story, all with their unique characteristics, history and lives, but all struggling with the same things, having a meaningful life and if possible, escaping death. This one is told through the eyes of Isak Borg, played wonderfully by the great and late director, Victor Sjöström. He represents what we all fear, being old and not being at ease with the thought of death, living out all of his emotion only through the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia, while having nothing, at the very least in the beginning, contemporary that he finds any meaningful emotional connection to. What I find fascinating by character is how much we’re told about blunt coldness, both to his wife and his daughter in law. But throughout the film, I personally saw nothing that resembled this cold and distant man that they kept describing, and only found myself sympathizing with this old man that is still struggling with the struggles that one hopes that one has overcome by the time of that age, but in his case, you get the sense that it has only gone downwards since his childhood, but that is perhaps me buying into the same charming old man persona that his daughter in law describes and doesn’t buy into. There is a sort of a repeating cycle in the movie, where the rigid and coldness is passed on from his mom, through him and to his son. A cycle which I assume is the main reason why the professor’s son, Evald, is so adamant about not having a child. Aside of the self-struggle with the themes mentioned earlier, it is also about the impact that we had and have on those around us, and much like in *The Seventh Seal*, it is about leaving or doing something meaningful in the short times that we have on this earth, even if it’s as simple as trying to lead a happy life. Outside of the obvious themes that the movie deals with, I found this movie very endearing, and found myself laughing out loud and smiling as often as I found myself sad during the movie, which is a first in my Bergman “watch through”(this movie is the 5th of his that I’ve seen). 10/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8x16cd/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e203hzw/)

* [I rewatched the movie **Big Fish** and this honestly might be my favorite Tim Burton film. This might be one of Tim Burton's more subdued movies. His style actually works in this story about this guy who is estranged from his dying father. Billy Crudup playing the son and Ewan Mcgregor and Albert Finney playing the father at different times. I believe this was Marion Colltiard's (who played Crudup's wife) first movie in the states. Jessica Lange is heartbreaking as the wife of Finney, especially in the later parts of the movie. I love how it's this family drama between father and son, yet Tim Burton's style isn't overbearing at all. It actually works when Finney/Mcgregor is telling stories about his life. It really is a beautiful movie about a dying father and his estranged son. The final moments when Billy Crudup tells Albert Finney how his story ends gets me choked up every damn time. And this cast. Billy Crudup, Albert Finney, Ewan Mcgregor, Jessica Lange, Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi, Marion Colltiard, and with one line in this movie, out of all people: Miley Cyrus has a cameo with one line, way before the Wrecking Ball days. This movie also has one of my personal Danny Elfman scores, particularly the track ""Finale"". It simply is just beautiful. Again, this just might be my favorite Tim Burton movie. I kinda miss when he did movies like this and *Edward Scissorhands*. I hope his *Dumbo* remake is back to the Tim Burton stuff that I dug when I was younger. But anyway, check this movie out if you can. I just love this movie so much.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8x16cd/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e207re1/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8tln44/what_was_the_dankest_joint_you_watched_this_week/) - thank you to /u/allwinter for making it extra dank:

* [**Shattered Glass** - I'd never seen this movie, I'd heard about it over the years though so I finally decided to give it a try. And wow is this a great character study, and a really interesting look at journalism from a now bygone era. It's anchored by a perfect performance from Hayden Christensen, playing the role he was born to play, but Peter Sarsgaard is equally as good in one of his best roles ever. Also it's always great to see Hank Azaria in anything. I also really liked seeing a world where the internet is just starting to change things. It's rare to see that ""on the cusp"" side of the internet explosion. If you don't know anything about it, I'd really suggest going in blind, as the ""reveal"" makes Christensen's performance even better. The basic plot synopsis is kind of a ""spoiler,"" though if you know the story of Stephen Glass it is still an amazing watch. It's streaming on HBO right now if you want to check it out. Also I'd suggest the director's very similar film *Breach*, which I think is just as good.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8tln44/what_was_the_dankest_joint_you_watched_this_week/e18fkfh/)

* [I saw **2001: A Space Odyssey** in 70mm (thanks, Chris Nolan!). Blew me away.  What really made the difference wasn't so much seeing it on the big screen (I've got access to a 75"" 4k TV and the Blu Ray) but rather,  the sound. I've got 5.1 surround at home with great speakers, but it's nothing like what I experienced in the theater. The screeching from the monolith on the moon was so loud it hurt-- which was the original intention,  I think. Likewise, having a 10+ minute intermission was something I've never experienced in a theater (born in 1990). It was amazing. It made a nearly 3 hour movie an entirely comfortable experience.  I used the bathroom, refilled my drink, and discussed what we'd just seen with the friends I was there with-- one of whom had never seen the movie, and had no idea what to expect going in! Then I saw it again the next day but got really high first. Not my proudest moment,  but a grand old time. Intermission let me use my free popcorn refill with AMC that I never get to use. Really sad to see the theater nearly empty both times. And the few people who were there were definitely old enough to have seen the movie on release. I'll forever love Nolan for this, and I'm not a big fan of his films.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8tln44/what_was_the_dankest_joint_you_watched_this_week/e18n6d6/)

* [**The Umbrellas of Cherbourg** is arguably the greatest musical of all time, on my opinion. The story itself was lifted, to an extent, for *La La Land* and watching both, you can clearly see the similarities and inspiration Chazelle took from Demy. The movie itself is such a delight. Every line of dialogue is sung in rhythm to the score, which is something I don't know anybody else has attempted. Despite that and the translation from French to English, it's crazy how totally engulfed I was in the story and what was going to happen. But the sets. Oh my god the production design on this film is incredible. There are so many colors in every shot it's like taking pictures of the inside of a Skittles packet. The Criterion transfer of the film looks stunning and is a treat to get to watch. I really cannot recommend this film enough. Despite it not being my favorite Demy film (that title belongs to *The Young Girls of Rochefort*) I highly suggest if you read this far into my post that you track it down and watch it. The Barnes and Noble Criterion sale is next month and if you have the spare change, the Jacques Demy box set is worth every penny.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8tln44/what_was_the_dankest_joint_you_watched_this_week/e18iq1k/)

* [I never expected to love **Punch-Drunk Love** as much as I did. I was a sucker for rom-coms about 5 years ago and binge-watched a shitload of them, even the thrashy ones. Something about those light-hearted rom-coms filled my heart whole in my lonely and boring teenage years. As I grew out of my teenage years, my standard for films grew, and I soon grew to dislike rom-coms because they are cheesy and predictable, and really plain dumb sometimes. *Punch-Drunk Love* was actually really all that, it was cheesy, predictable and plain dumb at times. It was however, due to this qualities, that I loved this film so much. These qualities were took on in a modern spin and a PTA sort of weirdness, and promises to take audiences on a ride. These film reminded why I loved rom-coms, they are cheesy and predictable yes, but holy hell I had a wonderful time with it. *Punch-Drunk Love* is probably one of the funniest rom-com out there. The characters were so well-written, the pacing was masterful. Adam Sandler was amazing in his role. I’m sure everyone has ever felt like Barry one time or another. Insecure, unable to control emotions, and a mess all around, but everyone, like Barry, has a good heart in them. I’m sure everyone, like Barry, feels like sometimes we can’t talk about anything and keeps secrets from our friends and relatives, but when we met someone that truly understands us, we pour all our heart, emotions and secrets out to them. Barry has one of the best character development I’ve ever seen in a romantic comedy. Only Paul Thomas Anderson can create such a wonderful little heartwarming film, add his own personal weird spin to it and yet still came out a masterpiece. Heartwarming, adorable, joyful, and amazing. My favourite romantic comedy ever. 5/5](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8q1q97/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e0gmpst/)

* [During a drug bust, Judge **Dredd** (Karl Urban) is shadowed by a mutant rookie with psychic abilities (Olivia Thirlby), they quickly find themselves marked by former hooker turned violent gang boss Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), who’s distributing and manufacturing an illegal drug called Slow-Mo, a hallucinogenic which slows down the brain to 1%. With a production budget of 30-45 million, director Pete Travis wastes none of it on-screen, showcasing a dystopian city governed by violence and fear, all filtered through a grimy colour palate. The slums of Mega City One is where death lives. A cesspit pit of hopelessness and terror. Corrupt judges bargaining with criminals for money. The film isn’t one bit shy when it comes to violence - blood splatters in every direction, hands get blown off and heads explode – all whilst innocent civilians are gunned down in the crossfire. The drug intake scenes are exhibited through glittering slow motion shots that look like something plucked straight from an anime. It’s like *Blade Runner* / *Training Day*'s brutal, grungy stepbrother.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8q1q97/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e0gyfdf/)

* [Watched **Blade Runner** for the first time. I both can't believe I waited this long to watch this movie but am I also glad I did. I don't think I would have appreciated it nearly as much even a few years ago. Through my teens I just couldn't sit through slower paced movies. If something wasn't a comedy or action movie, I just couldn't get engrossed in it. The visuals of the movie are absolutely breathtaking. 4k version on an OLED TV. For most films I don't think that would require a mentioning but its benifits are really noticeable in *Blade Runner* and it massively adds to the film. I almost don't believe that this movie is 36 years old. Viewing this movie this long after its release, a lot of its themes are not new to me. They have been done since then. Nothing about the story was surprising to me, however I thought it was well done. I don't feel like I am any new insight into the film other than give my opinion that it is absolutely worth a watch today. I do not feel that this is not a film has been proped up on nostalgic. Will be watching *2049* soonish. Run time on that one is intimidating.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8q1q97/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e0h8wpr/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8o994k/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Upgrade** - This movie rocked.  Great, pulpy, sci-fi fun.   It felt like a love-letter to Paul Verhoeven and late 80's early 90's sci-fi films like *The Running Man*, *Robocop*, and *Total Recall*. The fight scenes were absolutely brutal and filmed in such a creative way.  Having the camera be totally in-sync with Logan Marshall-Green's movements really puts you into the action and gives them a really visceral feel.  The only other time I've seen that technique used with stunt choreography was in one quick shot during this fight scene from *The Fate of the Furious* when Hobbs bodyslams Shaw.  I remember when I first saw that shot I was blown away.  To see a film utilize it more throughly and really explore it was great.  *Upgrade* never overstays it's welcome either and even though the first act takes it's time setting up the story, it's necessary for Green's arc and understanding his motivations. Director Leigh Whannell (*Saw*, *Dead Silence*) also did a great job with the emotional beats in the story and I was surprised at just how funny the movie was at times too.    The biggest highlight had to be the relationship between Green and his STEM implant.  The way it talks to him and their quipping back and forth during the action scenes had the audience in my theater laughing out loud. Huge kudos to LMG.  He did a fantastic job with not just the acting but with the fight choreography too.  He really sold the idea that someone else was in control of his body.  His unnatural and robotic movements and his hilarious facial expressions reacting to what he was doing played perfectly. He definitely deserves better than being called 'budget Tom Hardy'. Anyone who thinks LMG is a budget anything needs to check out *The Invitation*, *Quarry*, and *Damnation*.  Plus, I can actually understand what Logan Marshall-Green is saying when he talks. Jokes aside though, this is definitely a movie that benefits from being seen on the big screen.  Not just to support original, indie sci-fi films but also because it was a total blast.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8o994k/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e01nakp/)

* [**Thoroughbreds** - I had been meaning to watch this film for some time. The poster interested me enough that I wanted to go in without knowing much about it. Having seen it, I'm impressed that it was made by a debut director. It was such a cohesive film. The score was particularly unsettling, and there were scenes that were funny but the music made it creepy. The sociopathy vs. psychopathy aspect was also quite well done - it was almost like the film was detached from the charcaters just like the characters were detached from their emotions. The cast was outstanding, every single one of them, including Anton Yelchin. The dude stole every scene he was in. I had only seen Olivia Cooke before in *Ready Player One*, and I can almost imagine her character in that to have this backstory because of that monologue about her dream of what the future would be like (it was quite similar except for when she ends it with the world being taken over by horses). I don't know what to make of Anya Taylor-Joy's character, but I suppose that's what psychopaths are like - you wouldn't know what to make of them. Also, for some reason I thought this was based on a book and was disappointed that it wasn't. I was looking forward to reading something like this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8o994k/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e01m7n8/)

* [I revisited Joe Wright's **Hanna.** Saoirse Ronan kills it! *Hanna* is a truly blistering espionage thriller by director Joe Wright. *Hanna* is probably my favorite film from Wright to date. It is fast paced, exhilarating, and interesting. Wright has crafted a wholly original spy movie that oozes creativity. Every scene has cool shots and wonderfully executed panning shots. Impressive sequence after sequence line every scene of *Hanna*. You will be amazed and entertained by this movie for sure. Wright perfected the action film with *Hanna*. Acting wise, *Hanna* has a delight cast of characters that emote their respective figures with surrealistic zeal. Saoirse Ronan makes for a deadly killer and a sweet heroine. She is fierce and believable as a spy, while also conveying Hanna's childish nature. Eric Bana is at his best as Hanna's tough, yet kind father. He is very cool as a spy. Cate Blanchett and Tom Hollander are two of the creepiest villains in film history. They will unsettle and threaten you. All in all, *Hanna* has a well cast ensemble. Musically, *Hanna* is exciting and loud with a fresh electronic score from The Chemical Brothers. The bass will blast, the synths will reverberate, and the themes will soar into your ears. *Hanna*'s soundtrack is quite memorable. I have not felt such thrills in a spy thriller since The Bourne Trilogy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8o994k/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/e01n9k6/)

* [I revisited Brian De Palma's **The Untouchables**. It really held up. I think it's one of the greatest gangster films ever! Brian De Palma might have directed his masterpiece with *The Untouchables*. Crime films reached their peak with movies like *The Godfather*, *Gangs of New York*, *Heat*, and *The Untouchables*. *L.A. Confidential* (1997) certainly was influenced by *The Untouchables*. The deep dive into the mindset of good law enforcement is commented on in this movie. It's style is reminiscent of the aforementioned movies, while creating an atmosphere all its own. *The Untouchables* goes full noir style police work. You get to watch what Eliot Ness had to do to catch notorious mobster Al Capone. Visually, *The Untouchables* contains some of the most memorable and skillful cinematography ever captured on film. The opening alleyway raid is so tense right off the start. The scene in Sean Connery's apartment is so suspense and nerve racking as we get long pans up and down his hallway. The finale at the train station's stair is as violent and exciting as any shootout. The camera is always showing emotional close ups or characters in the foreground speaking while we get the reaction of someone in the background. Endless clever and creative camera work is on full display throughout *The Untouchables*.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8mja4k/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dzo525c/)

* [**Stations of the Cross** - What a bizarre damn movie. It's a German movie directed by Dietrich Brüggemann that's a quasi retelling of the final days of Jesus as told through the trials of a young girl named Maria (which is already setting up the loaded biblical narrative). Anyway the movie continues through a series of static shots in which all the action takes place in one certain setting (a random section of a park pathway, the school library, a dinner table) and each section is punctuated by a short chapter heading describing what section of the biblical narrative we're in. I don't know what to make of it quite honestly. It's a really difficult movie to parse through because even though the narrative is relatively simple, thematically it elves into the power of religious Catholic  ideology and how it can poison the mind of a young girl to the point of suicide, where she sacrifices herself because she believes God has spoken to her and has told her that he will save her baby brother in exchange for her life. However, this point is not even conceded by her own mother who essentially eggs the entire thing on in a incredible display of pure ideology. She's a terrifying figure in this movie. It's like a modern version of a horror antagonist like Kathy Bates' Anne Wilkes or Nurse Ratched. It's all the more terrifying because it's not showy. The mother is performed by Franziska Weisz with such an understated ferocity and unyielding religious dogmatism. It's a really wonderful performance that plays with the ground between fiction and reality. It's not a simple movie, you may be slightly bored by the way it is shot since the entire thing plays out more like a moving painting rather than a play. When the camera does finally move it's more than a shock cause you realize there's someone alive operating the camera, but it will give you and your friends some real good conversation material.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8mja4k/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dzo4iub/)

* [**Nil By Mouth** - written and directed by Gary Oldman (his only one so far), this very gritty film centers on an extended South London family coming apart at the seams. The fantastic Ray Winstone is Raymond, who provides for his family by running an illegal liquor supply business with his childhood mate, Mark (Jamie Foreman, who was the out of control drug boss Duke in *Layer Cake*). Raymond's sad sack wife, Valerie (Kathy Burke, who was wonderful as Connie Sacks in *Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy*) puts up with his drinking, drug use and being out all night carousing at strip clubs because she unfortunately loves the big lug and possibly fears no one else would want her. The spark that blows the family finally apart is Val's brother Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles, seen at the beginning of *The Fifth Element*, which was directed by this film's co-producer, Luc Besson) who has a £60 ($100) a day heroin habit that is driving him to steal from everyone, including Raymond. Helping him pay for this is his clear-eyed but still loving mum, Janet. She is played by Laila Morse, who made her film debut in *Nil By Mouth* and who happens to be Oldman's sister in real life. There's some real acting talent in that blood because Janet is the grounding force of the film, knowing her children's faults while still loving them unconditionally. This is not a film that is easy to love itself and the drug scenes are realistic enough they could cause relapses. There is not a false note in the movie, especially in the way the characters interact. It feels like Oldman pulled back a tattered curtain on this teetering on the edge of dysfunction family to show something honest and real. FYI - the characters speak in a very thick South London (Cockney?) accent and I had to resort to using the subtitles to follow it. Said subtitles aren't always great as I noticed many words were dropped, usually expletives. Speaking of which, this is R-Rated for a good reason and heaven help you if the word ""cunt"" offends you. It is probably uttered a good 500 times by both genders.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8mja4k/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dzobbkj/)

6,"What was the best film you watched this week? (21/05/2018 - 27/05/2018) #We are lucky (?) enough to be alive during a time where two new Star Wars movies have come out within six months of each other.

The way this works is that you post a review of the best film you watched this week. It doesn't have to be a new release, just any film you have seen over the last seven days that you feel is worth talking about. Here are some rules. 

**1. Check to see if your favourite film of last week has been posted already.**

**2. Please post your \*favourite\* film of last week.** 

**3. NO TV SHOWS!**

**4. ALWAYS use spoiler tags.** Report any comments that spoil recent / little-known films \(e.g. *A Quiet Place*, *Avengers: Infinity War*) without using the spoiler tag.

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8kt4p3/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**L.A. Confidential** (1997) - Dir. Curtis Hanson: *L.A. Confidential* has most of the stuff that you would expect from a typical noir detective story. It has a very intricate plot with twist and turns, a love interest that is involved with the case etc. But it isn’t the plot itself that makes this movie so good, outside of the period setting and lovely music, it is the character contrasts between mainly Russel Crowe’s Bud White and Guy Pearce’s Ed Exley that takes the main center as the driving force of this movie. To simplify it, it’s basically a movie about good cop vs bad cop, but it’s not as black and white as it sounds, and the distinction only becomes more and more grey the more into the story that we go.Kevin space’s Jack Vincennes, despite how weird that it felt to watch the first 10 minutes, is played brilliantly as expected and offers another contrast to the characters of Bud and Ed, almost an in between. Unlike Bud and Ed, Jack doesn’t have a strong sense of character, in that he doesn’t steer in one and another, in any other case this might be good, but in this case, it shows a lack of care and conviction. The scene where he answers: “I don’t know” to the question: “Why did you become a cop”, is very telling of his character. The brilliant thing about *L.A. Confidential* isn’t that it convinced me that any of the “ways” are right or wrong, but that it made me understand them, and made a solid case that they all have their place in the world, despite how illegal or immoral it may seem from the outside. The weird thing is that it's filled with a bunch of cliché’s, half the stuff, especially that has to do with Crowe’s character you could see coming a mile away, but they never feel contrived because they all served the purpose of driving the characters forward. Pair it together with wonderful camera movements, great acting, wonderful setting and soundtrack and pacing that never felt off, it’s no wonder why this film is so highly acclaimed. 9/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8kt4p3/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dzaawhq/)

* [**I Kill Giants** is like the definition of a cool concept that gets mislead down other pathways to tell a much different story than the one you want to see. I really enjoyed some of the main story even though the hook was pretty much predictable from ten miles away, the journey getting there was really good. I even got emotional during some parts, mostly during the encounters between Barbara and Mrs. Molle, as well as the scene where Karen tries talking to Barbara to penetrate the veneer of fantasy that she's built around her. It was in someways reminding me of *The Shipping News* and *Ondine*, mostly cause the settings were similar in someways and the latter also involved some sort of mystical fairy-tale folklore element that turned out to have a simpler real world explanation. HOWEVER, and that's a big however, the parts where Barbara does encounter the fairy-tale element of her world is so cool that you kind of do wish it were real on some level for her and the worlds around her, like it felt like when it added that Spielbergian element of adventure you can feel the movie taking off, but then it comes back down. I understand that the whole thing is a parable about copping with the loss of a loved one, but god damn the Harbingers were so cool and then she got out the hammer and that was friggin awesome and then they fight a titan and that was awesome too. I get the sense if I watched *A Monster Calls* I would be in for the same kind of story.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8kt4p3/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dzaajf1/)

* [I saw the very well reviewed **The Rider**. It was most interesting to me as a sociological  'slice of life' exploring what I presume is 'small time' rodeo in South Dakota. But I feel like the filmmaker's failed to raise more interesting questions then get clearly dramatized, which would involve how young men already existing on the razor's edge of economic catastrophe can only find self-worth by an activity that risks destroying the only thing our society expects of them  (bodies to perform physical toil for low wages). But this is more suggested than clarified. Like how do these guys pay their hospital bills? As for the aspects of horse training and rodeo - I have to say  I had issues with all this I have not seen mentioned elsewhere. As much as the main character is said to 'love' horses, I actually find there to be a big difference in training horses to be ridden  vs. the 'sport' of rodeo. There is a big element of outright antagonism in rodeo (man vs. horse) where in 'good' horse training there is more of coming to an 'agreement' and making the horse understand what you're trying to do (so man WITH horse). So because of that - I just could never fully 'get' with the agenda of this film as being about a guy who 'loves' horses. I think the 'loving horses' part kind of interferes with the less sentimental 'story' of how this guy needs horses to define his own self-worth. Its not that this is not 'there' in the film but I think its not as well clarified as it could be.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8kt4p3/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dzahcnl/)

* [**Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior** - I thought that I was an expert on this film. I had copied it on VHS way back in the day (mid '80s), and had seen it many times. The great quotes this movie gave me as a kid! I just watched the bluray and, OMG, the detail and lush world that is created in that movie blew me away (again)! What an amazing precursor to the latest movie; purely in the same vein, unlike the 3rd movie. It was great to see such a progression and growth as a story and a film series. The bluray let me see stuff I hadn't before, such as Lord Humungus' pulsing veins in the back of his scraggly haired head. What a ride this movie is! Plus, it was weird to see all of the gory details since I had only had a version I copied of of tv. Back to the latest movie, it was great to see how Miller was able to confidently do away with a lot of the voice over narrative introduction and just let the viewer jump in. I wonder how much of that leaned on the prior films, because I feel that the second Mad Max film could have skipped that stuff and it would be pretty clear to the viewer that shit went south and gas is now gold. Love it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8hgre4/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dyk7llw/)

* [***Dancer in the Dark*** **\(2000\), by Lars Von Trier** - I had seen this movie a long time ago, when I was in high school. For some reason it came back to my mind a few days ago, and decided to watch it again, as I barely remembered anything about it. It's incredibly heartbreaking, and also very weird at times. The musical numbers happen when you least expect them, but I guess that's what you get when someone like Von Trier is behind the camera. It's an anti\-musical, actually, with really messed\-up songs, dealing with really messed\-up stuff. Also, Björk's performance is impressive. She really embraced her role. There's not much I can say, honestly, as it wouldn't do it any justice. It's something you just have to see. In the end, it's not a movie for everyone. From the themes it deals with, to the way it is made/presented, it's definitely difficult to watch, but I wouldn't have it any other way, honestly. A brutal film.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8hgre4/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dyl4zrd/)

* [**Paddington 2** - I have been anxiously awaiting the Blu-ray release of this film for weeks. What a warm bear hug of a movie it is! This is the kind of movie that fills you with good cheer that sticks with you awhile like marmalade. It's very funny and tugs at your heartstrings several times.mAll of the actors turned in excellent performances. In particular, Hugh Grant and Brendan Gleeson were a riot. Paddington Bear's animation and vocalizations from Ben Whishaw are pitch perfect. What an adorable little fellow. As far as the people working behind the scenes go, this film is a feast for the eyes. It's very colorful and visually impressive, with more than a handful of rather inventive sequences. Also, I just love the comic sensibility of this film series. Paul King and his team are skilled with both slapstick and wit. It's hard to pick a favorite comic moment as the movie is funny throughout. I will say that if you haven't seen this movie yet, do not miss the hilarious mid-credits scene.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8fstmm/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dy6b9ny/)

* [**Ares** - Went down into the trash bin of Netflix and came out with some decent prospects. It feels like the plot of a direct to DVD Roel Reiné movie but with some above average second unit directing. And the reason you can probably tell that is cause all the stuff probably shot by the main guy looks like television while the environmental stuff exploring the world looks so, soooooooooooooooo much better. Anyway, it's two thousand thirty something and humans have given up autonomy over their own bodies. The French government has collapsed and a consortium of corporations called the Towers runs the place now and everyone keeps voting for them, claiming there's more freedom even though there clearly isn't. Global Warming is in it's early stages utterly ravaging the place, destroying food supplies and overpopulation spills into the ciry streets with tent cities, and the only solid job is becoming a genetically enhanced MMA fighter in the Arena. It's if *Children of Men* seeped out all the subtext, allusions to classical art and literature and all the cushy thematic stuff you could dig your teeth into and was simply about depressed mixed martial arts fighters beating the snot out of each other to feel alive and liberate the masses from their material conditions. It's...pretty decent. Everything just wandering around the shitty hellscape of pre-post apocalyptic France was really intriguing and then it went back to the story of sad jacked guy being used as gun for hire to police protesters in like a cop for a day program. It's an interesting concept shot some times really interesting and sometimes it's like they just go back to the TV aesthetics.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8fstmm/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dy7977v/)

* [**Escape From New York** - I LOVE this movie, Kurt Russell is one of my favorites and its a classic John Carpenter film, can't go wrong with those two at the forefront. I would reccomend everyone watch this movie as a comparison to the big-budget action/superhero movies of today. Now, I'm as big an MCU fan as anyone, but *Escape* really is a shining example that getting bigger and louder doesn't make movies better. First, the look of the film. Kurt Russell's Snake Plissken is in good shape, but he's really just a guy. Russell didn't tack on 45 pounds of muscle for the role, but he conveys his characther's strength with his demeanor, and the supporting cast act around him in a way that makes obvious how respected and feared he is. Additionally, the tech the government has is simple and almost adorable compared to the hologram touchscreens that paint every wall in movies now. The sets as well are smaller and grounded and the fight scenes are shot in a very simple and organic way. The story is also straightforward. Find the President, get out of Manhattan with him alive. There is a throwaway line of dialouge about how China and Russia could use nukes to end the world if Snake doesn't get the President out, but it is contained to just that one line. The conflict feels great because it is great to the main character, not because it is great in scale. Compare Escape to modern blockbusters, and it looks dated, and slow. It feels corny at first. But just keep watching until the 25 minute mark when things start accelerating, and you won't be able to keep yourself from being drawn in for the ride.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8ar8va/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dx2y452/)

* [Film four out of six in Rohmer’s series ""Six Moral Tales"", **My Night at Maud's** is simple and subtle in direction and plot, yet the film is deep in meaning and very revealing of the character’s motivations and feelings. The film takes place mostly within the character Maud’s house where three characters discuss religion, mathematics, choice, and how all three topics may be related to each other. The location and the duration of the scene is where the title gets its name. Like most dramas, Rohmer’s film favors dialogue over action yet the film breaks usual Hollywood genre conventions by fully committing to having subtle performances and quiet exchanges of dialogue. Also unlike most Hollywood dramas, Rohmer does not try to impress the viewer, instead he opts to respect the viewer. He shows his respect towards the viewer in the same way he writes his characters: treating them the same and as intellectuals. The film is no doubt in my mind an “intellectual” film. Containing many philosophical conversations ranging from Pascal’s Wager to being sure in one’s faith in God, the film never stops to explain the material to the viewer. With this, I never found the film being too complex or showing qualities of being too over-your-head for more philistine viewers, but I feel sure that a distracted viewer will find themselves bored. Meanwhile, observant viewers will be rewarded greatly with revealing blocking and great acting highlighted by the candid gesturing of each actor unlike the performances of most Hollywood dramas. And also unlike most Hollywood dramas, a viewer can not fully understand *Maud’s* by reading or listening to the film; in order to truly understand the magic in Rohmer’s masterpiece, the viewer must be vigilant of each character’s actions. While watching the film, I remember myself looking to where the characters were sitting in the room or paying attention to what their body language was saying in that moment. Never throughout the film’s hour and fifty minute runtime, I found myself bored; instead, I found myself doing the opposite: carefully observing each and every scene. As the film came to a close, with an excellent ending and a question left for the viewer, I found myself coming out of my trance with the realization that *My Night at Maud’s* is the type of film that I never knew I wanted and that the film is the type of movie that I need to see more. Rarely do you see a film where a character argues with another character instead of arguing “at” another character. If you do not understand the distinction of arguing ‘with’ versus ‘at’ a character then I recommend this film for you with a promise that after the first few scenes, you will know exactly what I mean. 5/5](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8ar8va/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dx1ys0s/)

* [**The Maze Runner: The Death Cure** - Out off all the young adult dreary pablum, I liked this one the best and I'm glad that Wes Ball was able to finish the series in his own way and building and reveling upon every single action movie cliche in the book with such unabashed glory that it all ends with a ridiculous stone monument with the names of Dylan and Wes as if to marvel at the ability to spend so much money and get away with it all. Really the plot doesn't exactly matter, it has all the trappings of modern action blockbuster cinema from magic blood, betrayals and turncoats, surprise last minute daring escapes to enigmatic resistance leaders with facial scars bearing the toll of disease of battle. But it's shot with such vim and vigor and an incredibly good eye for action over the course of a gratuitous 2 hour and thirty minute run time that Ball closes out the era of dystonia teen apocalyptic with about every single piece of eye candy and thrill he can get out of it. Patricia Clarkson gets pushed to the back seat and Aiden Gillen finally gets to be the villian he could have been in all the rest of the movies. I'm sure these characters meant something to someone since the Newt character gets a sendoff fitting for *Point Break*, so I'm glad they were able to get out of it what they could cause man was it a thrill watching the filmmakers keep upping the ante on what they're willing to blow up. Wes Ball is a skilled action director with a very acute sense of grand CGI set pieces and ability to keep the tension running along with the swiftness of even the best moments in the Fast and Furious franchise. I hope he gets more opportunities to do more of this stuff.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8ar8va/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dx1xrvh/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/872ez6/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/) ^(well technically it's from two weeks ago because of April Fools but who's counting):

* [**A Clockwork Orange** - Stanley Kubrick is an amazing director, and this movie was an experience. From the graphic and violent nature of the main character, to the beautiful cinematography from Stanley Kubrick and his cinematographer, this film is a piece of art that is disturbing, but very powerful. Before watching this film, I was told by people that is was a highly disturbing film that was really hard to watch. When I heard this, I imagined gore and horribly nasty events, similar to *The Human Centipede*, or *SAW*. When I was finished with the movie, I felt that my expectations were too high in that area, and I was kinda relieved that it wasn't too bad. The main character is an interesting dilemma for me. On one hand, I have no sympathy for what happens to him throughout, and feel that justice has been served. On the other hand, I feel for him once he is released from prison. Its a similar sympathy dilemma from ""Breaking Bad"" with Walt.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/872ez6/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dwba4ge/)

* [**Boogie Nights** - This movie blew me away. Never did I think I would so enjoy a film about Marky Mark becoming a famous pornstar with a huge cock 5 stars, but here we are. Not only was this an absolute joy to watch, but it has all the aspects of a truly great film. A killer cast with awe-inspiring performances, weaving storylines that manage to surprise at every turn, beautiful cinematography and camera work, and a flawless soundtrack and score. This film is just so smooth in every way and does better than damn-near every film to immerse you in the story. But obviously, the best part of *Boogie Nights*, and what pushes it past greatness, is the direction and screenplay from Paul Thomas Anderson. The film ventures into darkness while still feeling lighthearted, it goes wild while still being grounded, and it's simply hilarious and passionate. The characters are seemingly endless, yet all of them are strong and have logical and exciting story arcs. This is one of those films that you just feel great watching, from the opening scene to hours (maybe even days) after you watch it. I wish I had more time to sit with this film and bask in the high of it. Is *Boogie Nights* a masterpiece? Who am I to say? But yes; yes it is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/872ez6/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dw9xtjs/)

* [Late to the party, but **Black Panther**. And it ain't the hype talking. One of the best standalone Marvel films, and one of my favorites they've done, period. I thought Michael B. Jordan portrayed Killmonger excellently, and thought the character was one of, if not the best villain the franchise has had. His cause was relevant and sympathetic, though his means were extreme. Chadwick Boseman did a great job as T'Challa. I did find him a little bland as a lead in a Marvel film, but given that the story heavily relies on his rise to the throne and acceptance of his new responsibilities, I get the decision to focus on other things. Still, an otherwise strong performance. Loved the female presences. Shuri and Okoye are some of my favorite secondary characters, Danai Gurira and Letitia Wright did great portraying some of the biggest badasses in the whole movie. I wasn't aware Martin Freeman was in the movie so much, but was pleasantly surprised with his character. Hope to see more of him. Was kind of shocked they killed off Klaue, but he was entertaining in his scenes. I also have to add that Ludwig Goransson killed the score. Quite possibly my favorite that Marvel has. Aside from some questionable VFX and a couple smaller issues, I really loved this movie. 8/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/872ez6/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dw9ucia/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/85coag/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [I finally saw **Call Me by Your Name**. It's an absolutely touching motion picture of forbidden love. *Call Me by Your Name* is a visual feast for the eyes. Beautiful cinematography of Italian landscapes, natural scenery, and open spaces offset the hidden feelings between Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer) in a touching depiction of homosexual lovers. These characters feel so real. James Ivory's dialogue is packed with verisimilitude and a believable take on how people actually talk. The film takes you on a emotional roller coaster during an Italian Summer. Elio and Oliver get to know one another and have split feelings and a coming together. You get to see the subtle visual and verbal cues they send to one another. *Call Me by Your Name* is leaves you with a numbing sensation of understanding. You empathize with these two men. You feel their pain. The acting is so very subtle. You are constantly wondering what Timothée Chalomet is thinking and feeling. By the end, you will cry. He is passionate, yet uncertain. You can tell Elio is thoughtful by Chalomet's face and movement. He is always thinking about how people feel about him. This feels so very much like how young people feel about themselves and find faults in their own personality that others do not see. It's a true to life portrayal and Chalomet performs with thoughtful choices every frame. He deserved the Oscar nomination. The bravery and detail with which Chalomet acts is breath taking and will leave you moved. The excellent and focused direction of Luca Guadagnino is evident with every frame. His shots are well paced, focused, and leave you with space to take in the surroundings. He lets you see people's faces and body language, while giving the environmental context for their world. His establishing shots show the whole Italian estate for the lush setting. Green nature envelops the characters in this world open to feeling. Guadagnino is a very talented director who makes sure you feel like you are following Chalomet everywhere to build your emotional attachment to his character. Overall, *Call Me by Your Name* is a lovingly tale of uncertain feelings and forbidden love. It's well shot, carefully written, beautifully scored by Sufjan Stevens, perfectly cast, and so affectionately acted by the entire cast. I cannot recommend this film enough. See *Call Me by Your Name* immediately for a heartfelt love story as well as a stunning resonance of empathy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/85coag/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dvx8bwm/)

* [In **Dheepan**, the inevitability of conflict is embodied by three Sri Lankan immigrants, strangers posing as a family of three to expedite escape from their war-torn homeland, whose emigration leads to a process of shaky acclimation that is explored with depth and care. In the beginning, they take an almost workmanlike approach to their newfound family structure, gradually forming the connective bonds they need to quietly integrate into the new world. The process is a slow one, perhaps too slow at times for its own good, but the authenticity and unique execution of its ""stranger in a strange land"" premise provides a new and compelling context to what would otherwise be tropes, assisted in no short measure by universally fantastic performances. The payoff of *Dheepan* is one that has seen its fair share of mixed reactions: a blistering, surprisingly violent climax that just goes to show you how badly a poorly timed Wilhelm scream can fuck up your entire scene (but I digress). I'm inclined to disagree with the notion that it's counter-intuitive, but it does include a sudden an unnecessary departure from the film's established framing style and camera techniques. Works on a thematic level, not so much on a technical one, but the end product is still as strong, engrossing, and confident as ever.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/85coag/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dvwuc9o/)

* [I watched Alfred Hitchcock’s **Vertigo** last night in New York City. Several theaters around the country are showing it on the big screen this week because this year is the 60th anniversary of its release. (You can check out Fathom Events to see if it’s playing in a theater near you.) I was born in March 1992. I’ve only ever seen *Vertigo* on television or on my computer screen. Suffice it to say that I feel very, very lucky to have seen it in an actual movie theater. The experience was amazing. The audience clapped at the end, and I noticed some things about the movie that I hadn’t picked up earlier, especially the movie’s humor and even its dialogue (the dialogue is subtly repetitive, but if you’ve seen *Vertigo*, you know it’s supposed to be that way). Several shots that looked ordinary on my computer just looked so impressive on the big screen. Anyway, I unfortunately missed the first 5 minutes of the movie, so I’ll be going back to the theater Wednesday night to see it! I look forward to seeing what else I can pick up on from this movie—Hitchcock just packs so much in there, and of course Jimmy Stewart’s and Kim Novak’s performances are sublime!](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/85coag/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dvy0ari/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/83pl0q/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Pan's Labyrinth** - Rewatched this because of *The Shape of Water*. This movie plays in the 1940s in spain after the civil war. Our main character is a little girl named Ofelia whose mother wed the military captain Vidal. She and her pregnant mother arrive at Vidal's current location and the story begins. Ofelia likes to read fairytales and during her stay at the new place magical things happen around her. The story around Vidal who hunts down rebels is the b-plot. 
What can i say, imo this is definitely superior to *The Shape of Water*. From a technical point of view the new movie has the edge cgi wise, but *Pan's Labyrinth* still looks amazing, the art/creature design is fabulous, the cinematography on point. More importantly though, the story is more mature, more fantastic, gives you more room to interprete it and the characters feel more real as well. The side plot in this movie is a lot more interesting, in general it focuses on these two main storylines while *The Shape of Water* adds a little bit too much noise in other places. *Pan's Labyrinth* is a dark (i have to stress this, it's definitely a fairytale for adults), magical experience and del toro's best work to date. 9+/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/83pl0q/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dvjlmm7/)

* [Only film I saw was the Russian film **Loveless** which was one of the 'best foreign film' nominees for the Oscars (didn't win). The director, Andrey Zvyagintsev, had made one of the great debut films ever with *The Return* some years back - and while his films are always worthwhile as scathing reflections of modern Russia, none of his subsequent films have been quite as great as *The Return* IMO. This film  starts with an unloved child of bitterly separating parents running away, with the meat of it being  the 'process' by which a search is undertaken for him when he doesn't return home and the lives the parents are making for themselves with new partners. I have to say - this is one of those films where the boy in question makes such a strong first impression, I never fully engaged with the story of the parents, which is the actual focus of the film. TBH - would have preferred a film about the kid, though I appreciated what the director was trying to do. I think it IS a worthwhile theme  that many people sadly project their negative feelings towards the co-parent of their child on the child and how this blinds them towards the humanity and inherent value of their children as human beings.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/83pl0q/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dvkcb0d/)

#Notable Box Office Stories

* Aided (slightly) by a [$66.5 million opening weekend in China](https://twitter.com/weier1231997/status/972854217651109888), **Black Panther** surpassed $1 billion in worldwide box office on Saturday, joining [an elite club](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/) of less than 40 films (without adjusting for inflation) that have achieved this. [As /r/boxoffice pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/83g1qt/black_panther_is_now_officially_the_1st_mcu_movie/), it is the first MCU film that does not have an appearance by Tony Stark to reach $1 billion worldwide. The domestic gross of *Black Panther* is now [7th overall](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic.htm) and exceeds that of *The Dark Knight* ($534,858,444), as well as the combined domestic gross of *Justice League* and *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice* ($228,977,297 and $330,360,194, respectively). *Black Panther* came in second place behind *A Wrinkle In Time* on Friday ($9,972,000 vs $10,214,000, respectively) but regained the lead for the weekend, with a weekend domestic box office of $41,136,000. This was also *Black Panther*'s fourth consecutive weekend at #1, and while we still have a long way to go before we see something like [*Titanic*'s 15 consecutive weekends at #1](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/bestranked.htm?page=WKNDSCAT1&p=.htm) again, *Black Panther* could be the first film since 2009's *Avatar* to spend five consecutive weekends at #1 if it beats *Tomb Raider* (the only new major release) next weekend (more on that later).

* Currently sitting at 42% on Rotten Tomatoes, the mixed critical reception for **A Wrinkle In Time** may have contributed to its second place opening at the domestic box office this weekend, with $33,316,000. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/03/11/box-office-why-wrinkle-in-time-stumbled-with-33m-debut-weekend/#64abc55c258d) speculates that the ""unexpected post-debut strength"" of *Black Panther* and the lack of time between its release and that of AWIT's may have hindered AWIT's ability to take the top spot on its opening weekend. The similarities between AWIT's opening weekend and that of two other famous Disney fantasy/sci-fi underperformers from recent history are hard to ignore; *John Carter* opened to $30,180,188 on the same weekend as AWIT in 2012, while *Tomorrowland* opened to $33,028,165 on the Memorial Day long weekend in 2015. Both of those films grossed less than $300 million worldwide, and both had budgets in the $200-250 million range. ^(I had previously listed the budget of AWIT as in the same range but redditors have rightly pointed out that that is only the case when you include prints and advertising; AWIT's production budget was $100 million, significantly less than that of the other two films mentioned.) [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2018/03/a-wrinkle-in-time-black-panther-weekend-box-office-1202324260/) points out that the most encouraging prospect for AWIT's next two weeks is the fact that K-12 schools will be on spring break over part/all of the next two weeks.

* With a domestic box office of $3,150,000, **The Hurricane Heist** did not manage to blow anyone away (heh) with its opening weekend performance. Its title immediately draws obvious parallels to last year's *Geostorm*, which opened to $13,707,376 in November of last year and ended up grossing $221,400,160 worldwide, even before the questionable quality of both films is taken into account (although it's worth noting *The Hurricane Heist* has more than double the RT percentage of *Geostorm* - 29% vs 13%!). It seems Hollywood is going to keep churning out disaster movies in the hopes of stumbling across another *San Andreas*, which opened to $54,588,173 in late May 2015 (this was one weekend after *Tomorrowland* opened - see my second bullet point). As for those of you who love bad movies and are lamenting the fact *The Hurricane Heist* will probably leave cinemas soon - fear not, for [*God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God%27s_Not_Dead:_A_Light_in_Darkness) will be released on March 30!!

* After taking home Best Picture and Best Director last Sunday at the Academy Awards, **The Shape of Water** grossed $2,407,000 this weekend at the domestic box office, an increase of 62.8% from last weekend's gross of $1,478,754. An additional 720 cinemas in North America chose to play the film, no doubt a result of its success at the Oscars. The winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, Chile's **A Fantastic Woman**, also opened in an additional 77 North American cinemas this weekend and grossed $287,277, an increase of 130% from last weekend's gross of $125,005. Despite taking home two of the acting awards, **Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri** actually played in 218 *fewer* cinemas this weekend compared to last weekend, and saw a corresponding 45.2% drop in box office to $705,000 (compared to $1,287,401). Finally, not an Oscar film, but Armando Iannucci's **The Death of Stalin** opened in the United States this weekend - but only in four cinemas nationwide. Nonetheless, the outcomes of the Five-Year Plan were exceeded because each cinema grossed an average of $45,327! Let us hope the glorious Presidium bestows their comedic genius upon the entire nation soon!

* Most of the planet won't be able to watch the film until next weekend, but the reboot of **Tomb Raider** starring Alicia Vikander opened to $14.1 million this weekend in select Asian markets -
 including South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the Philippines. Notably absent from this list is China which is getting the movie next weekend as well. In June 2001, the first *Lara Croft: Tomb Raider* opened to $47,735,743, while its 2003 sequel *Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life* opened to less than half of that with $21,783,641. Barring a very unlikely second weekend increase in box office for *A Wrinkle In Time*, *Tomb Raider* is the largest obstacle standing in the way of a fifth consecutive weekend at #1 for *Black Panther*, so I'm sure many of us will be paying attention to how well the film does next weekend domestically.

This is a segment where we keep a weekly tally of currently showing films that aren't in the Top 5 that fellow redditors want updates on. This week we have added *Annihilation* to the list at the request of /u/numb3red and /u/tahubob .

Annihilation | $26,094,514 | info not available | $40M | 3

After twelve weeks, **The Greatest Showman** finally fell out of the domestic box office Top 10 this weekend, grossing $1,775,000 and landing at #13. On the [list of films that never made it to #1 in the domestic box office](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/domestic/never1.htm), it is in the top 20. Mainly I just wanted to link to this list so we can all be reminded again that one of the greatest Bond movies of all time (if not *the* greatest) never reached #1 because George Miller made a movie about dancing penguins.

* [**Black Panther** - Wonderfully Afrocentric, celebrates African heritage without the burden of colonialism. It's beautiful really. The visuals, the soundtrack, the costumes, the characters...it's one complete unified vision of Afrofuturism. The characters are just so complete, the story arcs are really strong. Everyone has a story, an internal conflict. The women in particular are just phenomenal, such variety of strong personalities. It's got one of the most amazing ""villains"" I've ever seen in a movie. Michael B. Jordan is just brilliant and the character is amazing really. It's not even really a villain if you think about it....where he's coming from is just so....justified. It's not ""good vs evil"", it's more two different perspectives on the same situation. Still a Marvel film, still fun....but it stands on it's own. It's completely special.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/807imy/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dutj1yu/)

* [Watched **Training Day** on  Netflix. Pretty dope police drama movie with a real great Denzel Washington in the lead role. He’s got a great filmography obviously, and I’m not sure if this is the movie that best warrants the best actor Oscar win, but this is certainly a captivating part with some great lines that are often quoted. I also found it crazy that the film was written by David Ayer. It’s by no means a ground breaking script (some unexplained story points, and one really over the top deus ex machine) but overall it tells a compelling, tightly woven crime story that really holds your attention for the runtime. It’s too bad he didn’t find similar success with *Suicide Squad*. The real standout is Ethan Hawke however. There aren’t too many consistently good actors as him, and he really gives a nice by-the-book cop counterpart to Washington’s crooked Alonzo character. Highly recommend if you haven’t seen it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/807imy/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dutjbce/)

* [I saw **(500) Days Of Summer** last friday for the second time after seeing it on the summer. While I watched it I felt like this could be the modern *Annie Hall*. It has the same quirky couple in an atypical relationship that doesn't end well. It has that upper edge on many modern rom-coms (can it be considered a rom-com?) of having a very good story written on a abnormally good script. It has it all. A great soundtrack. Brilliant performances by the two lead actors, expecially from Joseph Gordon-Levitt that gave arguably the best performance of his life. It shows the relationship between Tom and Summer and all its ups and downs. It shows a raw point of view about love and how difficult it can be when it is not reciprocal. It shows the grim world a person can live when a relationship ends. And it shows what can happen (and will most of the time) when you have an idealized version of the person you are dating and how quickly those same traits can leave you fuming when the relationship is over. Overall: Solid movie with a wonderfull story and great performances in an abnormal rom-com.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/807imy/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/duuilim/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7wtwp0/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**The Exterminating Angel** (1962) - In the confines of a single room, 20 members of Spain's upper class find themselves strangely unable to leave the parlor and return home. Left to their own devices, they descend into a ravenous hypocricy and each of them brings forth their innermost darkness in Luis Buñuel's sharp, surreal satire which, for all its fleeting fantastical elements, remains a grounded, scathing deconstruction of the high society. The thing that most surprised me about *The Exterminating Angel* is how it deals with the one obvious natural weakness of its premise. Surely seeing all of these characters, no matter how well-developed they are, remain trapped in a single small room for days on end would become incredibly boring, but *The Exterminating Angel* realizes that the environments of the wealthy and oblivious are inextricably linked to their own lives, symbolic of their profuse levels of vanity and self-absorption. As the guests grow weary and restless, their surroundings become more disheveled and it works to keep the story dynamic counter to the static setting. Joyously tongue-in-cheek about its portrayal of these people and their hypocrisies, *The Exterminating Angel* builds upon the characters' stress levels with increasingly long and bizarre stints of madness, enough to satiate the most committed of interpreters, but the overall message is one that is not particularly difficult to comprehend. Success in the terms of making such an experience visually interesting is a resounding plus, but in the incredibly subversive conclusion lies the film's bleakest and most biting satirical element, and while *The Exterminating Angel* is still good aside from that, one masterful swoop of a socially conscious mind makes it ever more worth the while.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7wtwp0/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/du38vgb/)

* [**Code Unknown** (2000) - Directed by Michael Haneke. I watched this two days ago and i haven't finished thinking about it.  An often harsh but fair look at the failing multi-ethnic society of western Europe, the movie examines social, linguistic and economic barriers. The ideas of miscommunication, inherent and involuntary prejudice shape the entire film. The film is also rich with lots of other ideas and themes that i have to watch again to fully entangle. I have yet to decode all the themes and ideas, i still cant cant decide if the film was pessimistic or ended on a sliver of hope. The movie starts with one of the most fantastically shot one take scenes on a street of Paris , introducing all the major characters  via  an argument on the street. This  scene is infact the kernel of the entire film where the central thesis of the piece is stated in very clear terms. The entire film then proceeds to examine and expound n the core ideas introduced in the scene as we get to know the characters more intimately. The movie has 50 or so scenes with majority being shot in a single take. A couple of scenes which i really loved: the opening shot (really the second scene of the film) on a street of Paris, a lovely scene in a restaurant where a young teenage couple are on a date which really displays the charisma of the young actor, the scnene inside a Paris metro where a major character undergoes verbal sexual  harassment by two young males. But in true Haneke fashion the scene has a lot of other themes shaping it which solidify the  arc of the one of the main  character. I feel truly blessed to have discovered Haneke for myself. I just cannot wait to watch all of his movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7wtwp0/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/du3c4ee/)

* [**For All Mankind** - This is a documentary, but it feels much more like a epic from the stars. This is a movie by Al Reinert, who surprisingly had a writing credit on Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within along other space related subjects, but this movie is pretty much a masterpiece of editing and sound. None of the movie is original footage shot by Al, but he ended up going through over a million feet of film to put together an incredible 80 minutes of footage that it pure awe inspiring. And the film really makes the interesting decision to not include the names of who is speaking over the soundtrack, making it feel at if it is simply just human kinds words and voices expressing the unmitigated wonder at the moment of it all. You get the sense that most of Terrence Malick's recent work is very much inspired by the way this movie is structured as well. But the images that are shown are just utterly incredible. The launch of the first Apollo rocket into space has such power and force and the images are so crisp and well shot from tracking shots of the entire rocket to this incredible overhead shot from underneath the Apollo rocket just making its journey into the atmosphere and it just holds there and you get to sense just what kind f undertaking is occurring. And then you get to when they make the final punch into space and they just get there and then you realize that all these guys will literally be remembered forever. They're the first to walk on the moon. The first songs are Buck Owens and Frank Sinatra played in space. All monumental firsts that will never be in human kind. Utterly incredible. highly recommended.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7wtwp0/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/du54wkb/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7v8hw7/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Avatar**, the Collectors Edition version which is just under 3 hours long. I fucking love this movie. The added scenes provide more wonderful little character moments which makes it more of a complete package and nearly 10 years later the majority of the effects in the movie don't look dated or obvious. It's remarkable that the movie doesn't really look like it's aged, and it looks comfortably better than the majority of special effects in movies that have come out since the movie was first released. I'm excited for the sequels and I think they're going to be massive. When people say the movie had no cultural impact they're gonna be eating their words when the first poster or teaser comes out for the sequel and gets talked about by everyone. Plus the movie did a lot of good stuff for the environment and that's more of an impact than many movies had. The story and characters are all familiar and don't break new ground, but these parts of the movie are all executed in a way that makes me care about what is going on in the movie and the real star of the show is Pandora itself. It's a world worth fighting for. It's a world worth visiting. And I can't wait to see Pandora again and to find out whatever James Cameron has up his sleeve for the sequels. Also off topic but I've finished the deleted scenes in the movie not too long ago and out of the hour of cut content I'd say most of it could make the movie even better. There's really little moments like the Na'avi getting drunk which is just a lot of fun and builds the bond between both Jake/Neytiri and Jake/the Na'avi who hated him at first. Then there's another where Jake tells Grace he has to keep going into the Avatar to be with Neytiri which is really sweet. There's some weird stuff too like a romance between Norm and Michelle Rodriguez and a 5 minute drugged up vision sequence but overall I'd love a rerelease of the movie which is nearly 4 hours long that brings these character moments back into the film.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7v8hw7/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dtqbg75/)

* [**Song to Song** - I was very pleasantly surprised. People have become more than tired with Malick's super effervescent style starting with *To the Wonder*, and I totally get that, but I think *Song to Song* is actually far and away the best version of his last three features (which are almost the same movie). How so? Thematically, it feels more tangible than his previous two efforts, powerfully exploring the idea of connection -- how people seek connection for different reasons, what good connection and bad connection can do to a person, and about how outer connections affect inner connectedness. *Song to Song* also has much more playfulness than Malick's last two films, and I think this helps give the movie some buoyancy, helping the viewer care about the themes and characters, and properly offsetting the more serious/philosophical nature of the many voice-over narrations. Specifically, Ryan Gosling, Rooney Mara, and even Michael Fassbender (at least during the first half of the movie) do very well with Malick's known minimalistic, ""let em go"" direction of his actors; much more than the actors of the last two movies, they seem to bring more life to the movie, rather than just looking like they're wandering around a scene. The photography also reflects this playfulness; the use of color is breathtaking. As should be no surprise with Malick/Lubezki, the film hinges on the power of the images presented. Not only seeing the beauty of but also interpreting the cinematography is more important towards getting into the narrative of the movie than the voice-overs are. It is understandable that a movie like this wouldn't be nominated for any cinematography awards, but I can say *Song to Song* probably had the best or 2nd best cinematography I've seen in the past year. If you're at least open to Malick's style, I would recommend it to you. Be ready to do some interpretive work though, as things will not be laid out for you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7v8hw7/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dtqd77f/)

* [**Insidious**. Most movies don't scare me. There's plenty of horror movies I like, such as *It* and *The Conjuring*, but they don't really scare me so much as entertain me in other ways. There were certainly a couple of scenes from It that spooked me like the garage scene or the opening scene, but most of the movie felt like fun horror than actual being scared of nightmares horror. And *The Conjuring* was really well made but it didn't scare me. It was entertaining but nothing stuck with me. I really wanted to be actually scared, like heart beating, not wanting to go to sleep scared. So I talked with some friends about what they recommended, because I've only been getting into horror movies for the past few months and there's lots I haven't seen. They recommended *Insidious*. I had heard before that it was super scary when it came out but I figured with their recommendation I'd give it a try. So I waited til like 4 in the morning, dead of night, turned off all the lights possible, moved my laptop close so it was as big as could be, and started it. And man, I'm not even kidding you, less than 30 seconds into the movie I had to stop it to reconsider. The violin soundtrack is FANTASTIC. As soon as I heard it instantly spike when at seeing the woman's shadow outside the boy's door I just got this awful feeling of dread. Never heard a soundtrack like it, heard music like it just once before but no horror has ever had a soundtrack with spooky violins like that. So I had to stop it. I tried two more times befoer I decided I'd be a man and just watch the movie. Even now it kinda just gives me the chills, but all alone in the dark at night? That really did it for me. I thought it would be a cheesy way to watch a horror movie but wow, it really worked. I also had lots of hype built into the movie because I had heard that there's tons of monsters, and jumpscares. Every bit of horror is actually scary, not fake scary where it's misleading, but like actually leading to something, like the whole movie was a haunted house. And wow it really paid off. The movie itself had some flaws but as far as the scare factor goes I was superbly impressed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7v8hw7/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dtqfiy9/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7tmuuw/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**The Man Who Knew Too Much** - 1934. It was probably gonna be the French Lieutenant's Woman this week but I had to send it back and Alfred Hitchcock's 1934 version of the film ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" was up on deck. I think I'm impressed with how much it does in such a small amount of time. The film is only 77 minutes, but already you get the sense that Hitchcock is very aware of his ability to fill that time with the kind of themes and images in such a nice economical package. Hitchcock in this film was making the transition to sound and it was pretty much the make or break for him because of a distributor who was sabotaging his career and eventually it found distribution, but the film is brimming with all sorts of wonderful life. And Hitchcock really displays in this film a real mastery of tonal balance and the ability to ease a viewer from moments that feel very screwball to dread and fear. It also has some very, very arresting shots like the scene in Royal Albert Hall when Edna Best starts to weep because she doesn't know if she should act to save her daughter or do something to save the life of this diplomat and the transition from her face to a first person perspective and then the camera loses focus to a gun peering out from the curtains is incredible. I also enjoyed the entire set piece where Edna Best is dancing with another man and Leslie Banks ties a string from his wife's sweater to the back button of the other guy and then they begin to move through the crowd as the sweater unravels, tripping up the other guests, and then a crack and it moves to this shot of fingers around the frame pointing to a bullet hole in the window. It's just a very impressive movie in its own right and extremely expressive. Peter Lorrie is fantastic as the villain. I watched the Del Toro supplement and discovered he actually wrote a study of Hitchcock. He managed to pick up on some themes of Catholicism that I didn't pick up on watching it and compared Hitchcock wanting to put you, the audience member, instead of a spy and making it bigger like other films such as James Bond.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7tmuuw/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dtdo2n7/)

* [For me it's gotta be Melville's French Resistance film: **Army of Shadows** (1969). I saw it for the first and second time this week. The film throughout uses a lot of dark blues as its colour scheme which creates not only a naturally dark setting, but a haunting one too. Accompanied by Éric Demarsan's score, which invokes dread, as well as a slight quality similar to thriller/espionage films. This seems to compliment Melville's aesthetic which is similar to his gangster films (however I have only seen Le Samurai and Le Cercle rouge so I am not sure how his other films look), with the trench coats, hats, and striking shadows (apt considering the title). Little on action (but when it's there it has your attention), big on suspense and tension; there's always a sense foreboding lurking around each shot, from the mise en scène to the characters themselves. The way the characters slowly move amongst the darkness make them seem almost ghostly figures, furthering the foreboding dread. Considering this, I believe the film is a great example of casting with Lino Ventura in the role of the film's protagonist: Philippe Gerbier. His character is middle-aged and has quite a prominent role in the resistance, yet what makes him unique is his contrast amongst other characters, particularly of his own age. Ventura acts with a young spirit for determination but also does not fall into the trap of being too expressionistic, he mostly keeps to himself and speaks when necessary. However, others around him seem to be more beaten down, not without loyalty to the resistance, but it certainly seems that hope is dwindling. For me, this is a great film that has instantly shot up as one of my favourite WW2 films.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7tmuuw/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dtdwar7/)

* [**Miami Vice** is a mood that, from the first abstract images, puts you there in the moment, makes you think that Linkin Park sounds good. Digital photography has never felt more real, the climax's gunfight operating with a sense of vérité that's greater than any 'reality' show has ever demonstrated, even in more normal environments. For a film whose title invites everyone else to look back and remember what it was, Mann took a chance to push us all forward. Rules of the game are always changing, detectives identities' ever-shifting. Notions of who, and what, you are get lost in the noise of the photography; these pictures are well and truly in motion at all time. The audience is right there with them –– to quote *Blackhat*: ""no-one's ever gotten this close before"" –– hoping that Tubbs and Crockett have a handle on it all. Of course, they struggle with reconciling their fabricated identities, with how they are and what they really want, but their brief conversation on the subject is enough to re-assure. Tubbs ""will never doubt"" Crockett. Neither should we. Time is luck. How privileged we are to be able to spend two hours in the lucidity of the experience, the ultimate ride-along, the defining achievement of 21st century cinema. Life is short. It'll stick with you forever.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7tmuuw/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dtdnia2/)

* [**The Emperor's New Groove** (2000). I have been on a quest to watch all 56 Walt Disney Animation Studios movies, and so far this movie (along with *Zootopia*) is the funniest overall of the ones that I've seen. The story was a fairly standard road trip film, and it was successful in being heartwarming and being a moral journey for Kuzco... but the movie excelled in it's humor. Kronk and Yzma are some of the most effective Disney villains that I've seen. They are both hilarious in their antics, and they are the driving source of humor in the film. Kronk is one of the few Disney villains that I actually felt sympathy for, and I ended up routing for him by the end. I'm actually kind of shocked by how funny and effective this movie was. *Chicken Little* (2005) is BY FAR the worst Disney movie I've seen in my journey, and it's main flaw was that it was painfully unfunny. I've come to learn that *Chicken Little* and *The Emperor's New Groove* had the same director (Mark Dindal). What the hell happened between 2000 and 2005 Mark?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7s0hoq/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dt0ywj6/)

* [**Apocalypse Now** - I had never seen it before because I never knew which cut to watch, but I finally said fuck it and picked up the Redux version and I think it might be the first time since I've ever seen a movie that I truly felt that this was just pure magic. There were whole scenes that were just completely remarkable, from the beginning to the end you just let the film roll over you like a tone poem and looked as if it was literally just filmed in the middle of an actual war. The themes and subtext of the movie are woven so well in the dialouge and narration. It's basically the perfect movie. All that shit you see in *Mad Max: Fury Road* and *Blade Runner 2049* has its roots in what *Apocalypse Now* put on film. The performances are basically perfect. Marlon Brando doesn't sound like the parodies of Marlon Brando, for the few moments he's on screen he's just visually arresting all on his own. Dennis Hopper's few moments are jittery and paranoid and give the entire moment they land at Kurtz's base the proper dread. It's just pure magic. I never realized how there was a whole second storyline about that surfer Lance. The movie is just as much about him as it is about Charlie's mission down river. Just incredible. It's a movie you should have in your collection. It think my only problem with it was that dinner scene wasn't really necessary, but those scenes were added back in the Redux. But they have so many good lines in them I can see why he put it back in the expanded release.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7s0hoq/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dt1aznl/)

* [**Blade Runner: 2049** -  I won't spoil this film. It's easily my favorite film of 2017 (so far) that's not *Star Wars: The Last Jedi*. It's one of the best looking movies I've seen, and it's all thanks to the cinematographer and production designer (along with the director, of course). Each shot is long enough for me to take in the details of the scene. Even the smaller scenes that don't necessarily move the plot forward with critical information (like Gosling's character walking back into his apartment building) tells a visual story. It's my favorite Villeneuve film (I've only seen *Arrival* and *Sicario*; yes, I need to see the other films) so far. It's just as great, if not better than the original *Blade Runner* film. Ryan Gosling gives a great performance (as usual; he chooses some of the most interesting films), and there is one particular moment where he shines. The rest of the guys also gave great performances (Ford, Bautista, Leto, etc.), but the women gave exceptional performances, particularly Ana de Armas (Joi) and Sylvia Hoeks (Luv). None of these roles were typical female roles and these characters develop in interesting ways. The plot is simple: Officer K (Gosling) is a blade runner who finds a lead on a case and must uncover the truth before a war breaks out between replicants and humans. There are twists and turns in this search for the truth and it's best to go in this movie without spoilers. Without spoiling anything, this movie addresses the overall theme of humanity in interesting and unexpected ways. I highly recommend this film to fans (and maybe non-fans) of *Blade Runner*. I don't think it's necessary to watch the first film or the shorts to understand this one (although you should), but they help provide some context to the situation in this movie.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7s0hoq/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dt10wpf/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7os3b0/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Tangled** (2010) - I have been on a quest to watch all 56 Walt Disney Animation Studios movies, I've watched 17 in total, and so far this is one of my favorites. Rapunzel's journey to seek more in her life and fight against Mother Gothel's brainwashing was very intelligently written. It's probably the best execution of the ""Lead girl wants more in life"" trope that I've seen so far. The movie was very funny, and I would say it's the second funniest Disney Film that I've seen next to *Zootopia*. Mother Gothel was an incredible villain. She was so manipulative in the way she managed to keep Rapunzel from leaving the tower. Although the songs aren't as memorable as other Disney movies, they do provide character development and move the story along. My favorite song would have to be ""I've Got A Dream"". Byron Howard is quickly becoming one of my favorite animation directors. If I were to make a top 10 favorite Disney movies list right now, *Tangled* and *Zootopia* (both directed by Byron Howard) would be on the list. I haven't re-watched *Bolt* yet, but I have higher expectations given the other movies I've seen from him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7os3b0/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dsbsxqy/)

* [**The Last Jedi** - I'm gonna be honest, I'm with the critics on this one - I absolutely loved it. In fact a lot of the things that seem to have pissed fans off I actually really liked - Rey, Snoke, Rose, Kylo Ren's character development, the humor (that ""evil spaceship landing/clothing iron"" sight gag got a full on belly laugh from me)... In fact the only things I didn't particularly care for was the cheap Leia fakeout in the opening battle, Rose's final line of the film being unnecessarily on the nose, and the way Hux went from an competent upstart general who could be genuinely intimidating at times to a total punching bag. I loved that the film went out of it's way to turn expectations on their heads and thwart fan theories. It was like Rian Johnson went ""Oh, you thought *The Force Awakens* was too full of Star Wars tropes? Lemme fix that."" On that note, I also strongly disagree with the accusations that this movie didn't move the overall plot forward at all: A significant chunk of the status quo that was established in *The Force Awakens* was turned upside down, and a number of principle characters went through a ton of character development. Mark Hamill and Adam Driver's performances were especially good (and Driver was a considerable improvement over the previous movie) and the sendoff to Carrie Fisher was pretty heartwarming. So yeah, top marks from me, and I'm genuinely looking forward to Johnson's new trilogy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7os3b0/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dsbxujo/)

* [Well I watched **Logan** a few hours ago, so that. When this movie came out, I made the mistake of visiting a youtube comment section. There someone had written the entire plot and only when I finished reading it I realised what I had just read. Top that off with not being able to watch the film because of the R-rating and you have yourselves one of the worst situations ever. Somehow, despite knowing what was gonna happen in every scene, I was always captivated. I managed to enjoy the film despite acknowledging the bleak reality of the world this movie was set in. It was a grounded story, which was a nice change of pace from other X-Men films where the world is always ending. Fantastic acting and an enjoyable yet bleak setting make for one of the best journeys ever.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7os3b0/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dsbtq40/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7ivwfc/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_04122017/):

* [**Mother (마더)** - (not to be confused with *Mother*(1996) or *mother!* (2017) - Holy crap, this movie... It's part psychological thriller, part *very* dark comedy (a la Fargo), and part Shakespearean tragedy. I will try to summarize it without any spoilers. It's very difficult because it's such an amazingly directed film, but let me tell you - it packs a wallop, and you'd need to see it for yourself. It starts off the standard murder mystery route. A strange, eccentric medicinal herb peddler only known as Mother (played by Kim Hye-ja - more about her in a moment) is extremely overprotective of her dimwitted, mentally challenged son Do-joon- almost comically so. After a golfer hits him with his Mercedes, he and his punk friend Jin-tae go out to pursue the golfer, smashing his parked car and stealing his golf balls. Do-joon decides to go to a bar that night and get wasted. He also tries to hit on some girls that night, but with no success. The next morning, the body of a schoolgirl named Moon Ah-jung is found hanging outside the window of an abandoned building. Authorities suspect Do-joon of murdering her, and arrest him.Mother, believing he could not have done it, then goes on an absolutely maddening quest - with a little help from Jin-tae - to clear his name. That's all I'm going to say. Kim Hye-ja does something few actors and actresses can do - grab you by the collar of your shirt and drag you straight into their character's psyche. Her performance is so emotionally powerful and gripping, I hesitate to call it a performance; you'd swear she's *actually* a madwoman. Anyway, it's an excellent movie, 9.5/10 would absolutely recommend- go check it out on Netflix (it's in Korean, but don't worry - it's subtitled.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7ivwfc/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_04122017/dr2bhzk/)

* [**Call Me By Your Name** - This is honestly one of the best films I have ever seen. Every shot oozes with sensuality and beauty. Guadagnino's direction made me smell the food on the dinner table, feel the Italian heat on my skin, and remind me of circling my fingers on a lover's chest. It's really not a ""gay movie,"" although the main relationship is a homosexual one. It's not a trite and typical ""coming out"" story - there's no life-or-death fear of discovery. It's simply a beautiful, exquisitely sensitive story of a doomed, passionate romance. On every level - acting, photography, film scoring (the opening track by John Adams and the two original Sufjan Stevens songs are standouts and match the action perfectly), this film is a tour de force. There are also strong classical motifs throughout, such as ancient statues, that help create a sense of eroticism (and it is erotic) without falling into smut. Guadagnino also uses nature to great effect, creating a sense of classical purity. He also swings you back and forth emotionally. I don't know how else to describe it other than: It's some of the most believable, deepest romantic chemistry I've ever seen. They are so convincingly in love. I saw it with three friends and after the credits, none of us felt ready to leave the theater. On a personal level, the events of the film happened to mirror a similar event of my life. Although there was no age difference, I had a quasi-relationship with a more experienced and more confident man while we were studying in Italy - my first real homosexual experience. I knew it couldn't last, and I knew that we were very different people, but somehow, during those months, we needed each other. Cheesy as it sounds, this film helped me come to terms with the impermanence of past relationships like these, even though they happened years ago. That's the power of this movie. I believe it's hitting wide release later this month. I highly, highly recommend it. It's not for everyone (think realism meets art house), and you shouldn't see it with a blood relative (it's almost X-Rated), but if you let yourself be moved by it, it will mess you up. In the best way.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7ivwfc/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_04122017/dr2ewj9/)

* [**Bad Genius.** I wouldn't call this movie underrated or overlooked because it has great reviews, and apparently it's really big and popular in Asia, but it was definitely the most surprising movie of the year for me. When I first heard the plot (a group of high school students try to smuggle out exam answers and sell them for a high price), I thought this was gonna have the depth and quality of YouTube Red and Netflix originals aimed for WOKE tweens (namely the absolutely horrible Coin Heist and The Thinning), but what I got instead was one of the most intense, real, and thrilling films of 2017. The stakes were way lower than your usual heist film; if the characters failed, they wouldn't die or go to jail, they would simply get expelled from school, but this just made it feel more relatable. We've ALL cheated on exams, and we all know the crazy anxiety and adrenaline rush that we felt fearing the humiliation and consequences of getting caught, and this film absolutely nailed those feelings to a T. Every exam taking scene was a nail biter and scarier than most horror movies, it sounds so stupid but it's honestly so unbelievably intense. The film also benefits from having a great sense of humor, good acting, and a fast paced editing style that is very reminiscent of Edgar Wright films. If it wasn't for Good Time and Get Out being so exceptionally great, I would confidently call Bad Genius the best thriller of the year, and it's definitely the most fun I've had watching a movie in 2017. Greatly recommended.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7ivwfc/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_04122017/dr1qvo8/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7h9cjz/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_27112017/):

* [Probably a cliche answer here, but **Citizen Kane**. As this classic film opens Charles Foster Kane lies dying in Xanadu, his palatial home in Florida. The last word he speaks is 'Rosebud'. A newsreel film about his life in which we learn how he acquired a failing New York newspaper, rose to prominence, stood for the governorship, married and divorced (twice) before retreating to Xanadu and becoming a recluse. After this reporter Jerry Thompson is told to find a different angle to the story; in particular the meaning of 'rosebud'. Over the course of his investigation he talks to Kane's second wife; reads through the archives of Walter Thatcher, the man who raised young Kane; he also talks to his business manager, Mr. Bernstein and former closest friend Jedediah Leland. As Thompson sees each of them we see snippets of Kane's life… how he was effectively sold as a child when gold was found on his mother's land; his idealist sentiments when he took over the newspaper; how he later manipulates public opinion; stands up to a corrupt governor only to be brought down by a scandal that ends his first marriage; a second marriage where he is determined to put his new wife, a singer, on the stage even if she knows she isn't good enough and ultimately how after others can't stand his controlling ways he dies in his private palace. This film is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made; this isn't just because it contains a fine story that is told in an interesting way but because of how innovative it was at the time it was made. This alone makes it a must see for fans of cinema. Orson Welles dominates the film; playing Kane through a variety of ages as well as writing, directing and producing the films. Even so he isn't carrying the film alone; all of the main cast are very impressive. The mystery behind 'rosebud' is intriguing but ultimately proves to be a McGuffin used to get Thompson to look more deeply into Kane's life and it is this life that drives the story. The way the story is told via a series of flashbacks works well as each person Thomson talks to reveals another aspect of Kane's life. Overall I'd say that this is a great film and certainly an important one; I don't know if it is the greatest but it is certainly in the running for that title.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7h9cjz/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_27112017/dqp7kyy/)

* [**Jurassic Park** - It was the first time for my younger brother, and the first time for me since I had been much younger. It's really, really, really good. This is one of those films you know you enjoyed before but when you watch it again with experienced eyes you are simply astounded by the sheer skill that went into making it. It's a masterclass in building tension. Every scare feels deserved, every (surprisingly frequent) violent moment got me gasping out loud. My boy Tim is a fuckin *soldier*. The amount of shit those kids lived through! The plot is a constant thrill without being suffocating or tiring, it's a perfect 'edge-of-your-seat' film. The effects are still bloody amazing, John Williams' score is still bloody phenomenal, the dialogue is still bloody great. The characters are all interesting, if not outright likeable. All in all I finished it having felt like I had just got off the biggest rollercoaster after avoiding it for a while and thinking 'damn, why did I not do this sooner?'](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7h9cjz/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_27112017/dqpc7jz/)

* [This week I've actually gone back and watched **Blade II** for what feels like the 100th time which is a bit of hyperbole but I used to watch this film all the time when I was a kid. It's amazing how well this movie still holds up even now. It's a perfectly good action/horror film which is incredibly fun to watch no matter how many times I've seen it. The characters in this are super memorable even if the vast majority of the Blood Pack outside of Reinhardt could've done with some more scenes. Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade, the action scenes are super cool, the lines are really cheesy but that's all part of the fun, the music used in the film is particularly memorable (specifically in that club scene), the film also does a good job with the whole vampire mythos in particular with the stuff about Nomak and the Reapers and even getting to see how the vampires spend their time around other vampires in a club environment too. It's a damn shame what happened with Blade: Trinity after such a well done film like this one, I means sure this film has its flaws but I find them easy to look past considering how much sheer joy watching this film brings me. Therefore Blade II is the best film I've seen all week bar none, that very well could change considering I'm planning on watching even more of my old favorites this week as well!](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7h9cjz/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_27112017/dqp70vy/)

* [**Your Name** - I've been waiting to watch this one for a while and besides a trailer I managed to keep myself relatively spoiler free on the movie. My flatmate bought it on Blu-Ray so it seemed like the perfect time to watch it. And I was blown away. The story went in directions I never expected it to and I haven't been so engrossed and worried for the future of the main characters since *La La Land*. My heart was pounding even after watching it, it was so intense. That's a credit to the filmmakers and the cast (dubbed) who were able to make me care for these characters. Their chemistry is really good and whilst I would have liked more of the Freaky Friday stuff from the first act since I loved these little character moments, overall I got enough stuff to care about them and their motivations. The art was nothing short of spectacular and made me wish that western culture was as into the hand drawn style as the Japanese. After so much CGI, even Pixar's state of the art stuff, it was a refreshing change. The colours and animation was just top notch. There were several times I was even creeped out at how smooth and realistic a few things looked even though I knew it was hand drawn. It blurred the line really well and I appreciated how it didn't seem choppy e.g. *The Killing Joke*. It's a movie that left me thinking about it after I saw it and that's exactly what I want from a film. Popcorn fun is all well and good but a movie like *Your Name* is something that will keep me coming back to it for repeat viewings. There's stuff I know I didn't pick up on the first time and I look forward to seeing it again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7fo4a5/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_20_nov/dqdb0kr/)

* [A Hindi film called **Talwar**. It’s a movie based off of the investigation of the murder of 14 year old Arushi Talwar in 2008. I finally decided to watch it since the murder happened and like 5 minutes from my apartment so I figured...yeah this feels like a movie I should look into . Plus it has Irfan Khan ( Indian guy from *Jurassic World*) who’s almost always a plus. The case became a national obsession after the police bungled it to a comical degree in the first 24 hours. How bad ? Their primary suspect turned out to actually be a second victim and hey somehow missed his body hidden on the roof ! From there it became a series of lurid theories, where it was claimed that Arushi was sleeping with the second victim, their 27 year old servant to get back at her parents for being swingers . By the cops! The movie follows the investigation from the earlier madness, through the case being handed over to the C.B.I ( our version of the F.B.I) who developed a totally different theory, to the conclusion where the Talwar were arrested for the murder based off of the case the local P.D built because while neither were super solid there’s seemed slightly more likely. The movie itself takes no side on which theory was correct. The movie is shot in a very understated way that lends a great deal of gravity to,the proceedings and expertly conveys the sense of confusion and tension among the investigators as they’re constantly mocked by the public. Highly recommend it if you can get a subtitled version.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7fo4a5/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_20_nov/dqd62yb/)

* [Just watched **The Disaster Artist** at a film festival, I wanted to make a post about it but I think the front page is already crowded with articles about the film as it is. What can I say about this movie other than the fact that I was smiling like an idiot in every scene: even when it is not flat-out hilarious (though it often is), it's just so well made and captivating, even if you already know about *The Room* (and if you've never even heard of it, the movie does a great job at explaining it to you). I have to admit it was even a bit touching at the end, and the fact that a movie made me feel inspired by Tommy Wiseau is truly an accomplishment. What else can I say about James Franco's performance that hasn't already been written? He's fantastic, truly one of the most accurate performance based on a real person (even if this real person is weirder than most): it would've been easy to just shout ""Oh hai Mark"" over and over again and call it a day, but he keeps it grounded and real, and turns Wiseau into this kind of tragic and flawed hero that still manages to be ridiculous when he needs to be. My only complaint was that Seth Rogen wasn't given much to do other than repeat constantly how ridiculous the movie is, but the audience I was in was completely captivated by the film and laughed the whole way through: they even clapped three times during the credits (for those who haven't seen it: stay till the end) and was overall very engaged, even if I'm sure most of them hadn't even heard of *The Room* prior to this movie. Truly a joy to watch, and it will be interesting to see if Franco gets some recognition when the awards season starts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7fo4a5/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_20_nov/dqd6qco/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7e26kb/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Casablanca** - I feel bad that I went 28 years in my life without seeing this absolute masterpiece. I *just* missed seeing it in theaters as a “Classics” promotion in Cinemark so I decided to watch it at home. It instantly became my new favorite movie. If you or anyone you know is even somewhat hesitating watching this movie, stop stalling and watch it. You’ll love it. Yes, it’s been parodied/spoofed/emulated a million times, and the ending and classic lines have been ruined and overused in other media, but in the moment, watching the movie, it holds up. This movie has a certain dichotomy to it all throughout. It’s a war movie with no battle scenes. It’s a romance without lovers. It is an old movie that stays perpetually relevant due to its themes. This is one that every film lover should watch at least once (though they’d probably want to watch again and again). It’s the type of movie that, despite being 75 years old is still magnificent and is downright insulting to suggest a remake. It’s the type of classic that is a perennial favorite even for that one friend that “doesn’t like black and white movies.” My favorite scene was the dueling anthems. I had seen the clip, out of context, before and didn’t understand why people liked it. “People are just singing,” I thought. In the context of the movie, however, I understood why people loved it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7e26kb/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dq1xk5l/)

* [I watched **Citizen Kane** for the first time. I have no idea why I've heard so many people (who um... kind of seem like idiots to me now, sorry I'm a bit frustrated) say ""oh it was good for the time"", ""it's kind of slow paced now"", or ""every movie is like it now, so it's not a revelation"" because this movie was just pure excellence! It could easily be the best movie I've ever seen! Every shot not in the documentary intro is a work of art. The plot structure is uses specific character's perspectives without feeling artificial or repetitive. The pacing at least felt incredibly fast and was certainly very well done with each shot flowing into the next, dialog overlapping in a way that I haven't seen outside of John Carpenter movies, and just a raw sense of energy to the whole film; I actually had trouble keeping up with the movie  (and I kept up with the LEGO MOVIE, catching every joke on my first watch) due to revelling in every single shot. The dialog was incredible and constantly surprising, regularly cutting to the heart with sharply written lines. I'm genuinely confused as to why people think there is a plot hole, as well. It's often repeated that ""there was no one there when Kane said 'Rosebud'"", but if you actually watch the movie, that's completely wrong. The butler flat out says, ""I heard him say it. He just said 'Rosebud' and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor."" That intro was taken as a POV shot of the Butler and we never get an establishing shot of the room where Kane dies, so why assume that he was alone? I straight up need answers, why is it that every single criticism I've heard of this movie was completely wrong? Do people just not watch this movie anymore and pretend to know exactly what its problems are? I mean that's obviously a harsh thing to assume, but seriously... how?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7e26kb/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dq1xhd5/)

* [**GOOD TIME** - Look. It's long since the world should've collectively decided that Twilight was a force for good –– it gave us Kristen Stewart *and* Robert Pattinson; two of the finest actors working today –– but this is the best and most accessible opportunity anyone has to get with that program. Powered by the manic of early Scorcese and Mann, an urge to keep on moving, Good Time hums along relentlessly without treading the streets the world has come to recognise, content to take a shortcut through the alleyways - perhaps the most quintessential New York movie (at least in terms, of being a story about the space it inhabits) since *Margaret*. That it accomplishes this while also being one of the most clever films about class in quite some time is no small feat. Marvelling at how this owns his persona as a heartthrob, weaponising his allure, while the Safdie's simultaneously weaponise his character's whiteness (and privilege that comes attached) for a sweat-wrenching ride that's all in the eyes. Connie's are all jittery, looking for the exits, working on the macro, while the Safdie's keep it locked in, focused on the micro. Like a piece of acid blotted-paper bearing Pepe the Frog; it's one heck of a trip.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7e26kb/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dq1vzp4/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7cgwfm/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Brick** - After seeing news of Rian Johnsons confirmed Star Wars trilogy, I finally decided to watch the High School Noir. As an aspiring filmmaker whos never made a film, it was absolutely inspiring. Its obvious it was done with little to no budget, but it still felt grand and invigorating. I loved the setting, its such an oddball choice for a movie and it sticks to its guns. The dialogue is intriguing, and while not my favorite it does set up an interesting environment. While movies like Romeo+Juliet makes me sick to my stomach, I was so engrossed by this world that I couldnt help but buy it. The characters were a smart mix of high school cliches and noir cliches. A protaganist as a mix of angsty teen with angsty noir detective. Femme fatale mixed with the high school popular girl. I was really entertained by the jock which was cleverly mixed with some sort of greek storyteller.  One thing I was extremely impressed with was the action. The way JGL moved in this film was just entertaining. Whenever hes in conflict hes just in a constant flailing motion, his arms and feet constantly trying to find balance as he propels himself forward. What a lot of movies forget is that the biggest asset film has in these sorta scenes arent flashy weapons or proper martial arts, its movement. If your character is moving around like JGL does in this movie, its just a treat to watch. It really shows the Rian's Cowboy Bebop influence. My favorite fight was definitely the infamous chase scene that ends with JGL taking off his shoes. Look it up on Youtube if you havent seen it, its insanely clever. If youre an aspiring filmmaker, this film is the exact thing you need to see. It does everything right and proves you just need a focused and properly executed vision to make a good movie.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7cgwfm/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dpq11v2/)

* [**The Florida Project** - Absolutely stunningly shot film. It is a very vibrant, colorful, film with amazing set designs. The film itself is a slice of life film about an entire community that lives in the shadow of Disney World. An entire community that you would pass by countless times on the highway without giving a second thought. It is a harsh look into the lives of people that most do not give a second thought to. It is a very realistic film. Sean Baker succeeds to make sure that the audience feels as if they are right there as the film takes place. Everything feels real, natural and alive. Exceptionally well acted, the child actors were great, Willem Dafoe gave an oscar worthy, nuanced performance. It will make you laugh, cry, be angry, sad, and joyful throughout the course The film. It largely follows the kids as they create this magical escapism to get away from the harsh realities of their life and we as the audience are just along for the journey. But contrasting the kids lives are the lives of their mothers who have to do everything they can to provide for their kids, whichever way needed. Characters have great arcs, and interactions with one another. we also see the kids become a product of their environment in a way. The ending will be the topic of most discussion. It seems to be very divisive. I think it is best not to get into the details of the ending and leave it up to the viewers to discuss afterwards. It might be a little bit of a spoiler discussing it in detail in my comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7cgwfm/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dpqbb96/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/78263q/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**The Florida Project** - I've always been a sucker for Linklater-esque films that, instead of striving to fulfill a three-act structure or force a dramatic conflict down your throats, attempt to tell a story simply (which is not to say the task of doing so is simple, but the plot is) by trying to capture a slice of life and portray it in a realistic/humanistic manner. *The Florida Project* does this spectacularly - it portrays a population of out society we fail to talk about in our social discourse, puts them on display in a way that neither glamorizes nor patronizes their experience, and tells a heartfelt story. It's strength is especially in the decision to portray this world through the eyes of kids, all of which hand in great performances. Willem Dafoe does a great job of playing authoritative/caring/someone who you pity immensely at times. Sean Baker's attention to both color and shot composition is awesome, and I look forward to seeing his future/other work. Highly reccommend!](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/78263q/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/doqf44c/)

* [**The Silence of the Lambs** - I might be out on a limb here, but I think this movie is pretty good guys. Underrated gem. In all seriousness this is one of those films with so much praise and love that when you revisit it part of you thinks maybe this time will be the time it breaks for me but my respect for this movie only grows. I was lucky to finally see it on the big screen this watch and I noticed so many little details I never had before. My read this time was that the film is all about the way all communication is a negotiation for power, and the virtuosity of the Hannibal and Clarice dialogue is such that it becomes a chess game with intricate moves jockeying for control. There's a great minor scene I never much paid attention to where the Senator is pleading over the TV to let her daughter go and what do the FBI trainees do? They analyze her speech like it's a calculated move, noting how she's trying to humanize her daughter by saying her name over and over. These people are so obsessed with the psychology of human behavior they no longer engage with it on an empathetic level. Also how great is it that the most famous scenes are shot-reverse-shot, generally the most bland part of any film. Demme does this wonderful little trick during the lambs conversation where he keeps the same close-up on Clarice put every cut back to Lecter the camera is just a little bit closer to his eyes. Honestly that's just my take this time, there's still a lot of great reads you can take on the film, especially in terms of being a woman in a man's world (how fucking great is that shot of Clarice in the funeral home with all the police officers surrounding her). It's film that just keeps rewarding every time I see it. It's totally deserving of its masterpiece status.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/78263q/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/doqfysv/)

* [**An American Werewolf in London** (1981). Movie is genius. The transformation scene is just so powerful, the music mixed with his cries of pain really hit you cause you like him so much. That guy's acting in that scene is incredible. Along with the special effects, his reaction during the first few seconds is probably the most intense tone switch of any movie I can think of. The way that whole day he's looking in the mirror doing silly hissing faces and Teen Wolf style werewolf poses in the mirror is such a great contrast to *""what the fuck I'm burning""*. The transformation really just comes out of nowhere, like you knew it was coming but at the moment it actually happens, you're caught off guard just like him. And that reveal of what the werewolf really looks like at the bottom of the escalator in the subway is what John Landis feels is the best shot of his career, it's so natural looking. Natural as in if you were walking by and looked down and saw that. I keep talking about it but it really is just that good. It'll have you feeling every emotion strongly](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/78263q/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/doqp2ds/)

* [**L.A. Confidential** (1997) - Finally got around to watching this masterpiece for the first time. It's always been on my list of movies to watch but I finally did it this week. It's hands down one of the best noir films I've seen. Definitely my top 10 of all time. The actors were impeccably cast and their performances were outstanding. I liked the way story moved and plot developed with the perfect amount of suspense and reveals. The soundtrack too was awesome and fit the mood of the movie perfectly. As mentioned Cast performances were stellar with Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Jack Vincennes being the stand out performance. Russell Crowe played the role of a brutish cop to perfection. Guy Pearce's portrayal of Edmund Exley as the honest, upright and shrewd detective was one of his best performances (seriously why is this guy not in many movies ?) All in all I don't think we'll get a movie like this ever again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6z9e0u/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dmtmpms/)

* [**Wind River** - I've been trying not to watch trailers for anything recently as to not form any preconceptions beyond general knowledge for movies, especially with thrillers, especially ones written (and this time around directed by) Sheridan. I loved *Sicario*, so much that I saw many similarities in *Wind River* beyond that of style. Here we see a female Federal agent who is guided through uncharted territory by a torn local man who knows the area much better than she does. Structurally it was very similar to *Sicario*, while I think it could have been more original it keeps a lot of the strengths from the structure and writing, ultimately the characters and climax. Jeremy Renner proves he's more than just an action star and gives the performance of his career, doing even better than he did in *The Town* in my opinion. Elizabeth Olsen shines as well in spite of her being a vehicle for the audience, she proves her worth to the story and conveys so many human emotions. While I don't think anyone can beat Benicio Del Toro, Jeremy Renner comes close with a character who better conveys their inner struggle. Olsen gave a more expressive performance that outshines even Emily Blunt's similar character in *Sicario*. In a way this movie was a *Sicario* with a more human touch, which may not be an improvement so much as a nuance to this type of story. Overall I'd say this is one of the best movies of the year so far. I really do hope the writing and performances are nominated, specifically Jeremy Renner, almost as a way to make up for the absence of Benicio Del Toro at the Oscars when *Sicario* was released.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6z9e0u/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dmto0aa/)

* [This week I found out that my local library has a free online streaming service with extensive selections from the Criterion Collection and Kino International, so I've flung myself into the world of silent cinema. The best film I watched this week was **The Complete Metropolis**, the most recently restored version of Fritz Lang's masterpiece released by Kino International. I'd already seen a version of *Metropolis* without the addition of scenes from the 16mm print discovered in Buenos Aires and loved it, but having those scenes there to flesh out subplots and clear up where some characters are, and when, made for an even more satisfying experience. Although the 16mm scenes stick out like a sore thumb with significant degradation compared to the rest of the film, and with text descriptions taking the place of scenes which are still lost, the scope and audacity of Lang's vision is breathtaking. Brigitte Helm's presence as both Maria and the Machine-Man is magnetic, and I was surprised by how clearly she differentiated the two different characters. The score used by Kino International (I believe it's the original score from 1927) is as brash as a Wagnerian opera, elevating the spectacle of the workers' uprising while lightly accenting the tender scenes between Maria and Freder. *Metropolis* is a masterpiece, and along with the films of Lang's I've seen for the first time this week (*Destiny*, the full *Dr. Mabuse The Gambler*, both parts of *Die Nibelungen*, and *M*), solidifies for me that he was an exceptional visionary and a master of film as an artform, which is hardly a hot take but at least now I've seen it with my own eyes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6z9e0u/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dmtncdj/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6wdubl/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**The Grand Budapest Hotel** - What an absolute marvel. I like the cut of any man’s gib who names *End of Evangelion* as one of the greatest animated films of all-time, but irrespective of that, Wes Anderson here directed one of the best...comedies? of the last decade. *The Grand Budapest Hotel* is a film that for most of its runtime feels like a really well-executed zany comedy that’ incredibly lively and vibrant. The cinematography is constantly interesting and creative, utilizing pretty much every trick in the book to glorious excess with tons of whip pans, tracking shots, wide shots, zooms and deep focus photography; in nearly any other year, where there wasn’t something like *Birdman*, it would have won the Oscar. The production design is bold and distinctive, using a really fun color palette and even miniatures to great effect. Really, from a stylistic standpoint, everything is truly exceptional and one of a handful of cases for me at least where the style is able to carry a movie over say, the narrative or the characters. Even the score is unique and loves its balalaika, but like everything else, it fits perfectly with the whole European feel of the movie. I said earlier that for most of its runtime, it feels like a comedy, which is true. However, while its humor is on point, it hits you at the end that the film is also quite sad and poignant, that it’s ultimately about a man who has lost everything except his memories of happier times and his nostalgia for the past. The movie is so fun that it manages to distract you until further reflection just how dark the undertones in it were, how your view on something can change depending on how you frame it (framing being a huge theme overall and coming up in a bunch of different ways), and it makes you want to watch it a second time with this new perspective. The fact that it’s able to juggle being an incredibly entertaining comedy with excellent performances (especially Fiennes who is perfect and I didn’t know he could do comedy) with genuine pathos makes *The Grand Budapest Hotel* something truly great.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6wdubl/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dm7c9k4/)

* [**Ingrid Goes West** - A totally bonkers film about obsessive personalities, mental illnesses, and how social media can play a big factor into it all. Aubrey Plaza is incredible as the lead, playing to her deadpan strengths, but showing a lot of emotional depth as well. She's fantastic at playing crazy and her performance makes the mentally ill character more sympathetic in her crazy actions. The rest of the performances are great too, especially from Elizabeth Olson and O'Shea Jackson Jr. It's also an incredibly funny and biting satire on how social media obsessed our culture has become. The elements of satire really elevate the film above a typical ""obsessive personality stalks somebody"" story. No doubt my second favorite film of the year. Incredible performances, poignant commentary, snappy dialogue, an incredibly tight script. #fantastic all around.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6wdubl/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dm7b64g/)

* [**Terminator 2: Judgment Day.** One of my favorite movies of all time. Saw it on the big screen for the first time in my life this morning when I saw the 3D version that was just released into theaters. The movie is still a genre-defining example of well done balance of action and story. So many instances of show, don't tell. Slow, emotional beats are contrasted well with great action that still holds up today. I still found myself getting chills during certain scenes. The nuclear bomb dream was so intense in a theater setting. Linda Hamilton, Arnold, and Robert Patrick just shine so much in this one. Edward Furlong grates on me a little more than he used to, but it's forgivable. The special effects sure why it was a pioneer of the time. They still look great, in my opinion. The 3D conversion actually was well done, and I usually hate 3D, and figured I'd suffer through it to see T2 in theaters. It was awkward in brief moments, but otherwise I enjoyed the new experience with an old favorite. Verdict: I finally feel fulfilled that I saw this classic a it should be experienced at least once.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6wdubl/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dm7jg8q/)

* [**Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them** just got added to HBO Now last night. What I love about it is how JK Rowling's writing style comes through even when it's a screenplay and not a book. Rowling has an affection for her characters that you can feel when you read her work, she always takes time to make them likeable. *Fantastic Beasts* does the same, it even has a number of ending scenes that most screenwriters would just cut out, but Rowling leaves in to give her characters some closure. It also has some nice world building, even if it isn't quite as overtly magical as Hogwarts and Diagon Alley. The idea of wizards having to live among the muggles instead of having their own places hidden away is really interesting. I also love how it has the ""massive destruction in an urban enviroment"" style climax but doesn't brush it off, it actually takes time to address the clean up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6tgm1i/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dlki19p/)

* [**Zero Dark Thirty** blows Bigelow’s previous film, *The Hurt Locker*, out of the water and it should have easily won Best Picture in this field. It’s a morally ambiguous story about vengeance and getting obsessed with it to the point where you lose sight of everything else, it eventually consuming you until there’s nothing else left but that, and after seeking this seemingly necessary goal for so long, what is left for you afterwards and was it worth the toll it took on you and so many others? It’s reminiscent of Spielberg’s *Munich*, but with better execution and a much stronger lead character & lead performance. Chastain probably should have won the Oscar here, as her performance has considerably more depth and nuance to it than Lawrence’s (who I thought should have won a couple of years earlier for *Winter’s Bone* anyway), and you can really feel the absolute desperation and obsession of her character through from everything she does. Beyond the great story arc and the themes and questions it raises, it also does a great job with the little details. For instance, it shows, without any direct dialogue, just how quickly any behavior can become normalized if everyone in your environment okays it, and that societal norms are extremely malleable and you can get desensitized to just about anything, even torture, over remarkably short periods. It also nicely showing the passage of time and how Chastain’s character gets further and further immersed in her job early on, by how she changes her look over time when interviewing detainees, her more conservative attire and a black wig reflecting her growing experience and her knowledge of what works in interviews. Finally, the scenes at Bin Laden’s compound at the end of the film are incredible, extremely tense, brutal and realistic. I would also go on to say as a slight negative that it tends to be a bit slow, although I get that it’s intentionally so given that it’s trying to make the audience feel the same kind of tedium and frustration the main character goes through on her long quest to find and kill Bin Laden that was filled with false leads and pouring over the same details over and over again. The other negative is that the first 30-40 minutes aren’t anywhere near as strong (mainly because it gets bogged down in too much jargon and is muddled in that regard), although the remaining 2 hours are so fantastic as to more than make up for it. Overall, *Zero Dark Thirty* is an outstanding film that serves as a fantastic character and thematic study while also asking some difficult questions in a very effective way. It’s truly great filmmaking.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6tgm1i/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dlkiu8n/)

* [**ATOMIC BLONDE** should probably be compared to the work of Soderbergh, namely *Haywire* and *Magic Mike XXL*, than the *John Wick*'s – a film about a professional (and at times, liar) in their element, who can only be themselves under the neon over the harsher, icier blue lighting. Willing to have fun with its genre, taking the source material, its le Carré sensibilites and deliberate overplotting, smashing them together with lashings of style –– and what style it is –– with kinetic, high velocity action that's resourceful at all times, even the sequences which aren't the showstopping stairway fight should be part of action film canon, resulting in an end result that's just delightful to sit back and watch, a true summer delight that surpasses every blockbuster this season sans *Alien: Covenant* in terms of putting a smile on my face. If we must compare it to Wick, then Leitch is a weaker director than Stahelski, but Charlize's magnetism beats out Keanu's grizzled roughness, a truly electrifying performance from someone looking to forge their own path, with no time for others to wait for others to play their part in the dance. (In my professional opinion, it would be a honour to be killed by her.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6tgm1i/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dlkhsmr/)

6,"The movies coming back to Canadian cinemas as part of Cineplex's 30 Days of Summer I was just checking showtimes on Cineplex's website and I noticed they had a ton of movies (from mostly the last decade) listed for the next few days. I think they're about to announce this officially [on this page](https://www.cineplex.com/30days) but otherwise I couldn't find anything about it, so I just thought I would make this post to let other Canadians know about it.

I live in Vancouver and I could only find two cinemas playing these movies (the [Park Theatre](https://www.cineplex.com/Showtimes/any-movie/the-park-theatre?Date=8/18/2017) and the cinemas at [International Village](https://www.cineplex.com/Showtimes/any-movie/cineplex-odeon-international-village-cinemas?Date=8/18/2017)) so it seems not every Cineplex cinema may be showing these. Nonetheless some of these movies are definitely worth seeing again on the big screen so I'm excited.

* [/u/jones1420 watched the Indiana Jones original trilogy](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6rzniy/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dl90egb/)
* [**Taxi Driver** - I feel that this one is up there on the Mount Rushmore of Scorsese films. Travis Bickle's loneliness, isolation, and teetering mental state all come together in the perfect recipe of disaster for a dangerously out-of-touch war vet who is driving around the dirty, crime-ridden streets of New York City. Everything from Paul Schrader's disturbed script, to De Niro's channeled performance, to Scorsese's masterful direction makes this film such a fine piece of work. Bickle's haunted mental state is nearly palpable throughout the film, and it's a reeling experience to watch his warped ideas and plans unfold, crumble, and re-route. If you haven't seen this classic, do yourself a favor and check it out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6rzniy/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dl8xnpz/)
* [**A Ghost Story** - What an incredibly unique film. I still can't quite put into words how I feel about it, but I've thought about it a lot since. On one hand, it seems sort of insane to watch someone eat a pie for 5 minutes straight. But on the other, it was such an interesting - and even realistic way - to represent someone's despair. The sound track is incredible as well, I've loaded it up quite a few times in Google Play Music since. My only real 'complaint' is that one scene that has about 50% of the dialogue in the entire movie, is a bit too on-the-nose, and really didn't need to be as explicit to explain the story. They did such a good job explaining the themes almost completely through visual storytelling...so it really wasn't a necessary inclusion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6rzniy/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dl92ehi/)

* [**Kong: Skull Island** was something I meant to see in theaters when it came out, but I just didn't care much about it. I didn't see any trailers, any commercials, I just couldn't bring myself to care that much. Fast forward to now, and I get a DVD copy for free. So I decide ""yeah okay let's try it."" And Ho Lee *shit,* that was a fun movie. And so much of a departure from what every other King Kong movie is. It's quick to give you solid action with Kong, who genuinely looks like a threat. He's fast, he's smart, and it's a blast to watch him fight other monsters on the island. And our human cast of characters aren't bad either. They don't have *too* much personality on their own, but they're likable enough to want to follow. And like any good monster movie, a lot of dudes kick the bucket in satisfying ways. I also think it's worth mentioning that it has a great use of color and makes for some really great background shots. I give it major thumbs up if you ever want a fun, well paced action movie with giant monster fights. And while I enjoyed Godzilla 2014 well enough, this is a giant monster movie that gets right to the point and does it well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6qhrvu/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dkxf9et/)

* [**Okja** (2017). Directed by Bong Joon-ho. Starring Ahn Seo-hyun, Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Paul Dano. Netflix got game. Damn. Heard a lot of good things about this one, but it was still something else. Fascinating and original story about fictional factory farming that felt all too real thanks to an incredibly lifelike title animal, the superpig Okja. There's a lot of great stuff here. They manage to give Okja the kind of personality you'd expect from a loyal pet, which I can't believe was easy given that Okja is CGI. The effects for Okja are incredible as well. She felt real even in scenes that required her to move extensively. It was hard to tell she was CGI at times. Throw in some real top shelf acting from Ahn Seo-hyun as Okja's human companion and A-listers Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Paul Dano, and damn. I've got a lot of respect for Jake after this film. He keeps finding new movies and new genres. His whole approach seems to be ""Have I done it before? No? Then I'm in."" Dano could easily have been a cult leader in another life. Tilda just brings some kind of crazy-pants energy every time she's in movies and this is no exception. Director Bong Joon-ho really caught my attention with this one. Going to have to track down some of his other stuff now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6qhrvu/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dkxknc1/)

* [**The Horsemasters**, 1961 Anette Funicello/Tommy Kirk/Janet Munro Disney flick about 8 college-age kids who come from all over the world for a sixteen-week course at an English riding school to become Horsemasters. Heartwarming family fun with lots of horses. It turns out a couple of folks have posted this to YouTube and like many full movies on the site, Disney probably sees no value in taking it down and views it a good exposure for a little-viewed but fun and lighthearted Disney property.    I wish it were better quality but it's probably pulled from the VHS tape release and not from film. It's not officially out on DVD which is a shame. BTW, it's the only movie I've watched in the last week, but it is one I am sort of passionate about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6qhrvu/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dkxltdw/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6f8k9t/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Wonder Woman** is a film that is rooted in rich mythology and history but avoids the tropes and trappings of ""throwback"" films that rely solely upon nostalgia, and it's a film that demonstrates how femininity is not the antithesis of physical (and emotional) strength but never resorts to cheap gimmicks to empower its female characters. It's a film that isn't afraid to jump between Diana in adorable fish-out-of-water situations and Diana kicking a ton of ass on the battlefield, and it does so without inducing too much mood whiplash. It's a tricky balancing act that we've seen be done badly in many a superhero origin movie but Patty Jenkins pulls it off masterfully here. Chris Pine is perfect in a supporting role that never overshadows Gal Gadot's but never seems like one that was written to be purposefully inferior to hers either; they just complement each other so well, and I challenge anyone to watch this movie and not ship the fuck out of these two afterwards. I think it's a fucking incredible movie and it's the first time in a long time that I left the cinema wanting to watch the entire movie (not just a handful of fun scenes) again, and go on that emotional journey with the characters again. That's more than I can say for the average summer blockbuster, and if nothing else *Wonder Woman* is above average.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6f8k9t/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dig8dzv/)

* [**13 Assassins** (1963) - this film is the first in a trilogy of films directed by Eiichi Kudo. This film was meant to stand on its own and it does. In fact, it's one of the best films I've ever seen. I have yet to watch the two sequels but I can tell you that you don't have to see them as the plot of this movie concludes with one of the best scenes I've ever watched with no cliffhangers. Most people have seen or at least heard of Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"". This film is very very similar to that movie. They are both equally as good, which may be hard for a Kurosawa fan to believe but after seeing this movie I'm even inclined to say ""13 Assassins"" is even better. It's that good. I couldn't find the movie anywhere so I had to rent it off of Amazon Instant streaming which was worth it. I can't recommend this movie enough. It has stunning cinematography and brilliant action scenes that are beyond real and perfectly put-together. The acting is of the highest quality too. There is a 2011 version of this movie which is actually good but nowhere near the quality of the 1963 version. So do not watch the 2011 version until you've seen the original 1963 one, I cannot stress that enough. You will be happy you did. The 2011 version is directed by Takashi Miike who also did a modern version of the 1962 Japanese masterpiece ""Harakiri"" which was good, but nowhere near the quality of the original.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6f8k9t/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dig9mov/)

* [**American Honey** (2016) - It's one of the most genuine works of cinema I have ever seen, and that isn't hyperbole. You can tell that plenty of the scenes were just the camera filming these kids while they did what they did, probably following a general outline of what they need to do and say. Some shots even appeared as though they could have been simply Shia and Sasha walking up to random houses that had no idea a movie was being filmed. The film itself is composed of a lot of mainly extreme close-ups that are going in and out of focus as the actors and camera move, which brings you even further into the lives of the characters. By the end of the film, you feel as though it is ending at the right place, but you don't feel a full sense of fulfillment. At least, I didn't. What I mean by this specifically is that you're left with the feeling that there must be something *more* because ""good"" films are supposed to have a higher, ethereal, emotional, moral, message or insight or some other shit, right? You see, the conclusion is dimly defined, yet still feels satisfying. While I think that ending the film with a more definitive tone would have given Sasha's character a more clear feeling of arc and development that's not really what this film is about. Life and growing up don't really have a definitive end, sense of an arc, or even a sense of a purpose sometimes (where am I going? where is this leading me? how am i going to get there? what if I never arrive?) Sure, we grow and develop, but that process never ceases. Maturation in life is just the experience of one event after another with the future never being certain. The narrative of the film reflects this. You feel like you're just watching a succession of events in Star's life, pulled along solely by your desire to see where her choices lead her.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6f8k9t/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/digargm/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6dql64/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Mulholland Drive** - After binging the original run of Twin Peaks, I decided to familiarize myself with more of his style instead of just Twin Peaks and Eraserhead. Looking around on Netflix I found Mulholland Drive. What a strange movie (something I expected). What I didn't expect was how razor focused it ended up feeling, even though I was completely lost at points. When I stopped thinking logically and having expectations for where the story was headed, and instead just went along for the ride, I found myself utterly riveted by the sad sad things happening to Naomi Watts and the people around her. Obviously David Lynch is well known for his style, and it's more apparent here. The moody soundtrack heightens and builds things in a way that makes whatever reveal or nonreveal almost anxiety inducing. From the dead body to the old people to the audition, the film is so well done in every facet that I found myself utterly immersed in the dreamy way that film presents itself. I'm going to watch Blue Velvet as soon as I can get my hands on it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6dql64/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/di4osad/)

* [**Boy** by Taika Waititi. It's remarkable how Taika takes a fairly generic subject (deadbeat father) and makes it feel so original and creative. He child performances are excellent; the main kid, Boy, has a very natural character arc, and his siblings and friends are all distinct, funny, and realistic. Waititi plays the father equal parts scumbag and lovable goofball. You can see he's a terrible father but you can still sympathize with him and see why Boy idolizes him so much. I had seen Taika's short film *Two Cars One Night* a couple weeks ago and it very much feels like the precursor to this film, stylistically and thematically. One of the main things I loved about the film was the depiction of the Kiwi culture. Filmed in Waititi's hometown, the environment feels different in its atmosphere and the people's sense of humor, but it's immediately familiar at the same time. It's deadpan, yet charming and full of heart. I've seen 3 of Taika's films so far, and they all feel different stylistically yet you can hear his voice in all three. I saw a TED talk of his where he says he wants to capture a snapshot of the human condition through the eye of a child, and he does it best and it never feels forced. I think that's actually just how Waititi views things.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6dql64/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/di4ofd8/)

* [**Quartet** (2012) - directed by Dustin Hoffman. A comedy drama set in a retirement home for musicians, with superb performances from Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Michael Gambon, Billy Connolly, Pauline Collins and several other familiar faces, including the wonderful Sheridan Smith as the young matron in charge. The plot revolves around preparations for the residents' annual celebration of the birthday of opera composer Giuseppe Verdi, with Michael Gambon's character, Cedric, attempting to coordinate efforts through considerable mayhem. Maggie Smith's character, Jean Horton, is newly arrived at the home, a particularly distinguished former singer who no longer performs. It quickly emerges that Tom Courtenay's character, Reggie Paget, and Jean were formerly in a relationship and there are bridges that need to be re-built. They are assisted in the process by Billy Connolly's and Pauline Collins' characters, both given a see-saw of riotously funny and deeply sad moments. The greatest pleasure for me was to watch the highly affecting performance of Tom Courtenay, one of the truly great British actors. Having achieved big screen success way back in 1962 in the adaptation of Alan Sillitoe's *The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner* he primarily focused his career on theatrical productions, rather than movies. Consequently his films are not many, and so gems like this one are to be cherished.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6dql64/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/di571ve/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6chljx/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**Y Tu Mamá También** (2001) - Once you get over the initial shock at how raunchy it is, this film has a lot to say about the bubble that upper-middle-class and wealthy young people inhabit, and how fragile that bubble is. The film follows two wealthy teenage boys, played by Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal, and a sexy roadtrip they take with an older woman, played by Maribel Verdu. It's directed by Alfonso Cuaron, and having recently re-watched *Children of Men*, it's fun to watch him deploy similar camera techniques - handheld long takes that often conclude by meandering away from the main characters - in a very different type of movie. Another technique he employs is to show working-class characters working in the background while the main characters are talking in the foreground, to heighten the sense of how insulated the two boys are. The three leads have some of the tightest, most natural chemistry I think I've ever seen onscreen. Major credit goes to the Cuaron brothers for crafting the Luna and Garcia's characters as spoiled, insecure, lovable, complicated people. It's very hard to make characters like that as likable and full-fledged as they are, but somehow the movie succeeds in doing that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6chljx/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dhuqhlp/)

* [**Only Lovers Left Alive**, by Jim Jarmusch. I had added this film to my Netflix list, mainly because of the cast. However, I was a bit hesitant about seeing it, as it deals with vampires and I'm not really into them. But man, I was in for a treat! It quickly grabbed me, thanks to its magnificent soundtrack, and the atmosphere it managed to create along with Adam and Eve. It's not for everyone, as it doesn't really have a plot, but it was just so great to see this couple go through the nights and just live. I felt really immersed, and I just wanted to be there, experiencing the world with them. I loved every second of it. It's one of those films I see myself coming back to over and over. Definitely goes to my all-time favorites list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6chljx/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dhv0s93/)

* [**Mustang** by Deniz Gamze Ergüven. What an incredible display of filmmaking in every single way. This film is about a group of 5 orphaned Turkish sisters as they struggle to live a normal life after their conservative uncle pulls them out of school for playing with boys at the beach. It's a beautiful, funny and heartwarming story about sisterhood when it needs to be, just like it's a brutal, raw depiction of female oppression when it needs to be. I think this is a film that a lot of people need to watch, it really highlights the importance of feminism in the modern world and not this boogeyman version of it that you sadly see around the internet; use it as an education tool if you will. It also subdues this other internet boogeyman by having amazing performance by a group of young kids, but it's the youngest one (Günes Sensoy) who takes the cake. I'm not one to hand out 10/10s, but this was deservedly a 10/10.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6chljx/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dhupiql/)

* [**Room**. Really fantastic film and certainly lived up to all the praise I'd read about it. Brie Larson and Jacob were tremendous in the roles. Brie has a real knack of communicating her emotions through her eyes and Jacob was just fantastic. He really brought Jack to life from the page. I was totally on edge throughout the entire escape scene. It was filmed really well and the shot of jack seeing the sky for the first time is really incredible. I know a lot of people have said the second half wasn't as good as the first but for me it felt really necessary and never really felt boring. The way Ma copes with what she's been through and the interview she does is really interesting. I liked seeing jack getting to know the grandmother and the way the step dad took jack in as his own really moved me. The scene with the dog was also very adorable. The end was really well done as it makes you realise how small room actually is when we don't see it from Jack's perspective. 10/10 movie.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6b45nw/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dhjpu29/)

* [**Wag the Dog** - A very amusing dark satire about a US President who gets embroiled in a sex scandal two weeks before running for re-election. His team brings in a spin doctor (Robert DeNiro), who teams up with a movie producer (Dustin Hoffman) in order to create fake war with Albania, in order to divert the public's attention away from the President. I thought this film was very amusing, with a lot of hilarious dialogue between the characters. De Niro and Hoffman are both fantastic, with great chemistry. There are a lot of interesting directorial decisions, where it almost feels documentary like at times. People bicker back and forth, the camera constantly whipping around, and zooming in on their faces. It really adds to the intensity. The satire on American patriotism and how we blindly support our wars and troops is very amusing, and it's comically sick to watch these puppeteers engineer all of this. It's funny, but also kind of scary, showing how easy it is to play with people's emotions when they think their country is at stake. All of the themes and issues satirized still feel relevant today. Funny enough, the film came out one month before the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6b45nw/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dhjpmsv/)

* (not quite a ""best"" film they watched this week but I wanted to highlight this comment anyway) - [Another rewatch of **Les Miserables** (2012)... Me and my friend can never get tired of tearing this movie apart, it's such a gloriously high budget collection of decisions that just dont work together: Like how the costumes and locations are really stylized and beautifully coloured but then the movie presents them through horrible angles and shakey-cam so the viewer can barely appreciate them - The shakey-cam is supposed to show the gritty realism of the situation of that time, but the costumes are so extravagant that it actively works against any ""realism"" the movie might have anyways. How the shots are all so close to the actors that we never get a sense of space or location or time. How they decided to use the singing from the takes instead of studio recordings, which ends up in the actors sounding like theyre warming up/rehearsing all the time because they dont want to completely waste their voice on one take (poor hugh jackman can do wayyyy better on broadway)... A new thing we noticed is that it seems like the cameras were hidden most of the time? They're positioned almost prank-show style, and the actor seem so unfocused because they probably legit dont know into what direction they should act. A lot of shots even seem like behind the scenes footage... i can almost hear the director babbling about ""capturing the raw emotion"" through this](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6b45nw/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dhjm0gp/)

* [**Ikiru** (1952). Starring Takashi Shimura and directed by Akira Kurosawa. Simply stunning. I've liked Kurosawa's stuff before, but this is a new high for him. The story of a career bureaucrat who discovers he's dying and alters the patterns of his life, one could be forgiven for thinking this would be prosaic, boring, or cliched. But it's so much more. That's due almost entirely to the work of Takashi Shimura. He hits you from multiple angles here; it's hard to focus on any one thing he does, almost to the point of being distracted. He manages to communicate a profound degree of despair with his eyes, so much so that you almost forget to listen to the soul of his voice being ground down as he slowly loses his battle with cancer. But it's unmistakable. He gets more hoarse as the movie progresses and sells the transition from healthy to defeated beautifully. There's a scene midway through the movie that involves him singing in a bar. It's one of the more gorgeously filmed and developed scenes I've ever seen in a movie. The final element here, then, is Kurosawa. He knows just how long to linger on things to get the shot. He approaches scenes from angles that are just slightly off from what one would expect. Maybe he looks at a character from below where the audience would be looking, or from a side angle that makes you feel like you're part of the film itself. Or maybe it's a head-on shot designed to almost make you expect that Shimura's going to break the fourth wall. Whatever he plans to do, from scene to scene, Kurosawa knows how to create a masterpiece. Highly recommend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/69sbpj/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dh8yp9f/)

* [**Rebel Without a Cause** (Nicholas Ray, 1955) - Been trying to watch an old movie for the first time once a week for about a month now, mostly kept up with it (the last couple were *The Lady Eve* (Stanwyck's fantastic) and *Key Largo* (not quite on the level of *To Have and Have Not*)). *Rebel Without a Cause* continues the trend of *mostly* liking a classic movie while finding bits of it... unconvincing? Melodramatic? Honestly, the movie *Rebel Without a Cause* most reminds me of is the dopey MST3K fodder *I Accuse My Parents*, but it's the best possible version of that film. You have three ""delinquents"" (James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo), all of whom come from relative comfort. The trick is that their home lives are nonetheless unfulfilling and sometimes very dysfunctional (whereas Jimmy in *I Accuse* was an idiot, full-stop). For example, Dean's mother constantly cows his weakling father, who at one point spends an extended scene wearing a visually offensive yellow apron over his business suit (that's an example of the film laying things on too thick). Wood's father fears her desire for child-like daddy-daughter kisses, maybe because he fears he likes them too much, but maybe because he fears a potential Electra complex. Mineo's parents aren't even there; a family maid (Marietta Canty) looks after him, and he spends his days pining after Dean with doe-eyes. I would've loved more scenes inside those families, watching those situations build and simmer and inform the teens' own anxieties - Dean's infamous ""tearing me apart"" line comes too soon to play as a convincing dramatic moment, because we haven't really seen a build to that fraught emotional cry for help (it's more a sort of pledge or declaration of intent from the film itself). But the film is also a gorgeous example of Technicolor, and director Nicholas Ray (*Johnny Guitar*, *In a Lonely Place*) creates serious tension during the film's more action-heavy sequences. An early knife fight, a midnight drag race, and a confrontation in a planetarium stand out for their visceral tension and snaps. And despite Dean creating an iconic image of teenage disaffection, Sal Mineo as the shamed homosexual Plato is the real star of the film. That desperate desire for Dean adds real uneasiness to a lot of scenes. James Dean's volatility comes from not knowing what's got him so upset, but Mineo's comes from knowing exactly what he wants and not being able to ever say it aloud.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/69sbpj/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dh93uuz/)

* [I watched **The Graduate** for the first time this week, and immediately fell in love. A lot of the best parts of the film are the little nuances and things that make it something very different from a normal movie. Just the opening scene alone, where the camera is on Ben, and his dad comes to talk to him, and Mike Nichols just chooses to linger on the profile shot of Ben that his dad is slightly blocking, rather than cut back and forth - that's the kind of stuff that makes the movie so unique. There are definitely many other examples, like the shot of Ben under the water in his scuba suit, the fast, jump-cut style editing whenn Mrs. Robinson exposes herself to Ben. The performances are all top-notch, and Dustin Hoffman just absolutely kills it with a honest portrayal of a person in crisis about their future. Anne Bancroft was also equally as good in her demanding, manipulative, yet damaged character. One of my favorite parts of the film has to be the soundtrack by two of my all-time favorite musicians, Simon and Garkfunkel. I had known all of these songs before, but to see them used in the context they are used in within his movie is great, with ""April Come She Will"" being a standout for me. I'm currently a year away from graduating from college, and I  am frighteningly a lot less sure of what I want my future to look like than I thought I was when I started college, so I think this film hit home in a way that seeing it at another time wouldn't have as much. That being said, I'm pretty sure, even just after watching it once, that this is one of my favorite movies of all time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/69sbpj/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dh969hv/)

Here are some great comments from [last week's thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/68fumo/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/):

* [**The China Syndrome** (1979). Directed by James Bridges and starring Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas, and Jack Lemmon. Well that's a film with some uncomfortable parallels to the present. This is a rather chilling look at the operation (or lack thereof) of a fictional nuclear power plant that had the unfortunate timing of coming out just prior to Three Mile Island's accident. Free publicity of the worst (best?) kind. Even without the publicity it'd be an excellent film. That's largely down to its leads. Fonda is great as a reporter who wants to do more investigative work but is repeatedly saddled with fluff pieces due to her looks. She's got multiple little mannerisms in the film which express that frustration without needing to straightforwardly lay it out with heavy-handed dialogue. Douglas is great as a very concerned cameraman who refuses to let the nuclear company or his own media bosses sweep a potential disaster under the rug. But the real star here is Lemmon. Jack Lemmon is amazing in whatever he does and he's electric here once he decides to do what he thinks is right. There's little more powerful than an honest man with nothing to lose, particularly if he's pitted against a system designed to crush him. That is what happens here, but not without him achieving a small measure of victory. That's maybe all he could have hoped to achieve, but Lemmon sells the hell out of his attempt with thoroughly believable confusion and desperation for a man in his position. The parallels to today are obvious and unsettling. I'm pro-nuclear energy (when it's handled well), so I don't see this movie as anti-nuclear, despite its history. I do, however, get a chill when I think about a company losing money and deciding to risk the lives of thousands in order to make a quick buck. The connections to modern energy companies' approach to environmental disasters is apparent and deeply frustrating.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/68fumo/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dgy4icg/)

* [**They Live** (1988). I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect about this movie. They Live, portrays CEO's and other big business people as aliens, that dictate how society is run. The Aliens have overrun all points of the social construct of society, when the Aliens see a non-conformist, such as George Nada (Roddy Piper) and his partner Frank Armitage (Keith David), the Aliens try to subdue them and eliminate the threat. Francisco X. Perez the make-up artist did a great job. The make-up was simple yet elegant. (South Park fans) The ""cripple fight"" scene was kinda thrown out of nowhere. Frank (Kieth David) throws out a sucker-punch just because he didn't want to put on the glasses. Even though Nada (Roddy Piper) was being forceful and a bit insane when he was trying to explain to Frank. I give this movie a 8/10. TL;DR It's a great fucking movie!](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/68fumo/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dgyig63/)

* [**Iron Giant**. Brad Bird does it again! I loved Ratatouille, and The Incredibles is my personal favorite animated movie, so i can't believe it took me this long to watch Iron Giant. Just like his other films, Iron Giant does a great job of evoking emotion and developing character. It was great watching the bond grow between Hogarth and the Giant, as well as watching the Giant coming to terms with his own violent nature. When the Giants true purpose is discovered, i thought the movie did a great job of showing how humans and the military would react to it. The fear and confusion (especially of the main villain) felt very realistic. As always with Brad Bird Films, the characters are fantastic. Hogarth was an amazing representation of a budding youth, and i would rank him with some of the best child characters i've ever seen. The Giant was great too, i loved the contrast of a hulking war machine being so playful and innocent. Hogarths mother was fantastic, i honestly felt like i saw some of my own mother in her character. One extra thing i appreciate about this movie was it's accuracy towards the period of time. Brad Bird perfectly captured the slang and cultural attitudes of the 50's. I would have to re watch Ratatouille to really solidify my opinion, but right now, i would say that Iron Giant ranks behind the Incredibles while ranking just slightly  in front of Ratatouille in terms of my favorite Brad Bird films.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/68fumo/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dgy4z8o/)

* [I just watched **Train to Busan** on Netflix yesterday, and it truly is a diamond in a sea of shit. Not only is it an unexpectedly good zombie movie, it's just a great movie all-around. It does have a lot of stock elements like the neglectful father and the asshole businessman, but it breathes a lot of life into its characters. Also, with probably 80% of the action happening inside a moving train, it's a pretty unique setting that we really haven't seen in a zombie film before. Best of all, this movie hits the big checkbox that I've come to demand of all my horror movies these days: I was rooting for the characters to live, not to die. It really felt like everyone was doing all they could to survive and there was really only one bad situation in the entire movie that was caused by somebody being stupid. In fact, it was less being stupid and more ""we're in a really big hurry, here."" If you like zombie movies, you'll probably love this one. If you're sick of zombies being overdone in movies and TV, this might restore your faith in the subject.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/673bkf/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dgnisg2/)

* [**Sleuth** (1972). Directed by Joseph Mankiewicz and starring Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. Both were Oscar nominated. Have you ever heard insults delivered by a Baron? No? Then do yourself a favor and watch this film. Directed by Joe Mankiewicz, it stars Laurence Olivier (said Baron) delivering some of the most artfully constructed insults to a very game Michael Caine. These two are at the peak of their games, even with Olivier in the twilight of his years here. Everything about this movie delivers. The mystery at its core, the two actors playing off each other. The setting (a country estate that becomes another character). It's all glorious. Adapted from a play by Anthony Shaffer, this could easily have gone off the rails given the entire focus is on dialogue and dialogue only. But damn. Two actors like this and you've got a masterclass in how nothing but spoken words can deliver the same punch as an hour-long action setpiece. Enjoy!](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/673bkf/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dgnbjb6/)

* [**Kung Fu Panda 2** (2011) - I really liked the first one, and i had only seen parts of the second one, so when i saw it playing on TV i decided to sit down and watch the whole thing. It was great, and is easily now among my favorite Dreamworks movies. The characters were very well written. Just like the first movie, Po was a great blend of nerdiness and someone going through a genuine emotional journey. The rest of the Furious Five were good as well, i especially like the emotional connection (not necessarily romantic) that Po and Tigress had. Po's relationship with his father was also much more developed and satisfying than the first film. But the character that stood out most to me was the villain, Lord Shen was fantastic. His motivations and mentality towards the choices he made were very well developed. His character was equal parts egotistic, narcissistic, and unhinged. Dreamworks movies can often be hit or miss when it comes to humor, often times it ends up being immature or too heavily based on pop culture, but the humor really worked in this movie. It was a perfect blend of slapstick and situational humor, and i laughed throughout. There was rarely a joke that didn't work. The plot was very good. It was a great emotional journey for the characters, mixed with a good deal of urgency and tied together with spectacular action sequences. I was actually pretty surprised how willing the movie was to address death. The whole arc of characters acquiring inner peace in the face of overwhelming trials was also very well done. All in all it was a great movie, and easily among Dreamworks best for me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/673bkf/what_was_the_best_film_you_watched_this_week/dgnb26g/)

* [**Kimi No Na Wa**/**Your Name**. It was only playing at one theater in my area for a single night, so i decided to check it out. It was fantastic. The characters were very well written, Mitsuha and Taki  were very relate-able and charming, and I was especially surprised at how well written the side characters were. The animation was fantastic, i was amazed at how great the city/country and items in the environment looked. It is easily the best animation i have seen in the Japanese style. The story was incredibly intelligent and an absolute emotional roller coaster. The twist was great, and the movie surprised me at multiple points. It wonderfully balances heartwarming moments, humor, and scenes of heart-pounding dread. It had the best ending of any movie that I've seen in 2016, and i wouldn't dream of spoiling it. Although i was a bit confused as to when Mitsuha and Taki were in each others bodies during the beginning, i understood it more towards the middle, and i feel that if i watch it again this problem would be erased. This is easily my second favorite animated film from 2016, it is absolutely criminal this didn't get nominated for Best Animated Feature. Although i did like Zootopia slightly better (i know that might be a bit of a controversial opinion) i would have been just as  happy if Your Name won. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/65ma88/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_041017/dgbekwo/)

* [I watched the Colombian film **Embrace of the Serpent**. Kermode recommended it as one of the top 10 films of 2016, and I usually enjoy films that are evocative of Heart of Darkness, so I watched it. It is one of the best films I have watched in recent years. It is not an easy movie to watch by all means. It's in black and white --gorgeous cinematography nonetheless, and felt like a documentary at times. But there were intense moments of magical realism, deep human connections and emotions, and incredible imageries and sets. The ending of the film was so powerful that I cried like a baby. The actors are all very good ---the acting was very natural, and you felt like you were in the Amazonian jungle yourself. The story is about one German and one American explorer who went deep into the Amazonian jungle in search of a particular plant that a particular unnamed tribe holds dear. But the story is not really about them at all, lol. I've never seen a film like it. But some people think it's in the same vein as Herzog's Fitzcarraldo, or Apocalypse Now. Give it a watch. It will change you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/65ma88/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_041017/dgbfyy7/)

* [**A Clockwork Orange** - I was fully aware of the many controversial moments that would be in the film and was still shocked, albeit not offended, by some of the material. Even more surprising was the fact that it had actually toned down several parts of the film from the original novel. Still, I was throughly impressed by the acting, pacing, cinematography and particularly the writing. Perhaps the most enduring element to me though was the incredible and original ways in which the film juxtaposed audience expectations against what occurred onscreen. The film often had other subtle moments. I especially enjoyed how his group wore white (a color generally associated with goodness) during their heinous acts while Alex wore a very dark suit after being released from prison. The film really is a marvel to watch and it is rife with so many relevant themes that still reflect today's society. Probably preaching to the choir on Stanley Kubrick's brilliance, but I am continuously astounded by the boundaries he pushed in creating some of the most magnificent films I have ever seen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/65ma88/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_041017/dgbicnn/)

* [**Moana** (2016). So, that was a thing. I've seen a lot of movies in the last 16 months (nearly 500, in fact), and few were a cinematic experience to match. Some had slightly better stories (though not many). To some degree regular acting vs. voice acting changes the dynamic, but not by that much. As such, this has to rank among one of my favorite movies of the last year or maybe even my lifetime. It's earned a place in the pantheon of all-time Disney greats. It starts with the imagery. The first half-hour of this, I was paying attention to the story but I had to maintain focus or else I'd just lose myself in the animation. It's stunning what they did here. The blues of the water, the ripples. The hair. The little details. Later, it's in things like the fights with Te Ka and Tamatoa. Just such an eye for the little things. The story adds another dimension. It's got Disney's standard heroine/hero takes on the world to save it plot but, without getting too spoiler-y, there's enough twists and turns here to keep it interesting. I think one of the best elements here is the interplay between Moana herself and Maui. It's initially distrust but the entire development of their relationship seems both organic and earned. Which brings me to the last point. The voice acting. Superb. Casting Johnson as Maui was a stroke of genius. He sells the hell out of that part. He's got a distinctive voice so it'd be easy to see him just being ""The Rock"" as Disney character, but he was so much more. Relative newcomer Auli'i Cravalho better have an agent, because she holds her own against Johnson and brings a strength to that character that is breathtaking. Honorable mention to Jemaine Clement as Tamatoa for the obvious Bowie homage. That is a ludicrously over-the-top and sumptuous scene. Do yourself a favor and see this, and then buy the soundtrack. A lot of Disney films have soundtracks with individual songs that can be taken separately and enjoyed. This one is an almost living, breathing unit. So worth it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/64e88g/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_040317/dg1hg9i/)

* [**Beauty and The Beast** - To be honest I was full of doubt going in. Though it would suck in a lot of ways but I was really surprised at how much I ended up adoring it. The music: Omg the music was fantastic. From the classic favourites such as Be Our Guest to the new ones like Evermore, each song was just so beautifully done. Gaston was my favourite musical sequence of all and I really enjoyed the mob song. Days in the sun was also really touching. Much prefer Angela Lansbury singing the title song to Emma Thompson as I felt Emma's over the top cockney accent got in the way. The acting: I got to admit everyone brought their A game as far as acting was concerned as well as singing. Luke Evans was FANTASTIC as Gaston. I enjoyed every minute he was on screen. Josh gad was hilarious and I loved Le Fou's character arc. Dan Stevens was quite good and Kevin Kline was really good. Loved that scene where he just freaks out and runs away from Chip. The voice cast was really good. Ewan's accent wasn't bad at all and he and Ian were hysterical together. Emma was quite alright in this but she had a few hiccups in places (acting with her eyebrows and such and she seemed a bit stiff and disinterested sometimes.) The cinematography: Omg the cinematography was absolutely amazing in this. Especially in be our guest, it was really spectacular to the point where I was sitting open mouthed throughout the whole sequence. I loved the castle, the forest, everything. Even the village looked pretty realistic. The camera work could have been a bit better though. All in all, I absolutely loved it and I really can't wait to see it again.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/64e88g/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_040317/dg1jzq6/)

* [**The Apartment** - I thought from the poster and the tagline that's it was going to be another 50s comedy. Funny but a little dated. But I was very wrong. This movie blew me away in just how biting it was. It was incredibly funny but also had a lot of pretty scathing commentary about corporate culture.  It's like an updated modern times. The story concerns C.C Baxter, an employee at a big insurance firm that in order to get an advantage regarding promotions allowed some executives to host their affairs in his apartment and fran kubelik, a lift operator who has an affair with a big shot at the company. Their lives intertwine in all sorts of bizarre ways throughout the movie and it's all around just a riot. Billy wilder had a knack for finding humor in scenes that shouldn't be funny. The apartment has a lot of pretty heavy  drama that somehow never loses its humor. I think that's it's greatest strength. It perfectly balances an engaging story full of great characters with a lot of humorous elements that may be ridiculous when viewed isolated but fit perfectly to create a zany whole that grabs you after 2 or 3 scenes and never lets  go. There are a lot of small character bits that define these characters. For example throughout the whole movie Baxter is not once called by his first name. His superiors who take advantage of him call him buddy boy. Everyone else calls him Mr. Baxter. It really shows the lack of intimate contact in this characters life. But jack Lemmon never makes him a clown.  He's an everyman who seeks approval and a place to belong. Fran,  played by an incredibly cute Shirley Maclaine seems more in control of her life but her chipper demeanor gets more and more stripped away throughout the movie and gets replaced by an almost resigned form of cynical humor. The third big character is  Jeff shelldrake. A high executive who strings an affair with fran along with promises of leaving his wife.  He's slimy and charming and you get the sense that he always gets what he wants but it's easy to see that he is just an egotistical asshole. I was insanely impressed with this movie.  Between funny satire,  funny character bits, an engaging and dramatic story,  excellent direction and an ending that made me all giddy and happy this is another entry on my list of reasons why the 60s were the best movie decade.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/64e88g/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_040317/dg1w38e/)

* [I finally watched **Casablanca** today. What a movie! I'm awed by the fluidity of the structure, the screenplay is amazing. I do have some nitpicks with minor plot points but the directing and acting is really top notch. I also think it has great balance, you have a lot going on at the same time yet each narrative doesn't call for your attention, it blends together for Rick as it does for the audience. I liked the small comedy moments that similarly don't call for your attention yet punctuate the movie nicely : the scene at the market, with the pickpocket, or the best one when Cpt. Renault takes his winnings as he declare his outrage that gambling takes place in the café. On a technical level it's faultless, I liked how the movie plays with light for the different characters. Characters are overall pretty great but a little manichean, my favorite was definitely the opportunist captain, he really blurs the lines of morality and interest. The women in the movie are also pretty strong which I wouldn't expect from a 1942 film. They don't directly fight like the men but they are willing to burden themselves with what men can't take (both Ilsa and the bulgarian refugee) I've read a lot that the film is propaganda but I'm not sure I agree with that, sure it present the US (Bogart) as the savior but it also shows how insensitive and opportunistic they had been so far. That's actually pretty harsh criticism of the US policies of the time because in 1942, the US barely entered the war some months ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/63146i/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_032717/dfqjzk9/)

* [**The Battle of Algiers** (1966, Algerian release). Directed by Gillo Pontecorvo and starring Jean Martin and Saadi Yacef. There are movies that depend on big names or driving and overpowering performances. Then there are movies that get you with brutal realism and a willingness to confront uncomfortable truths without the big names or shattering performances and it's in many ways more impressive. This is the latter. The Battle of Algiers relies almost entirely on a cast of native Algerians, with the exception of a lone professional French actor playing Colonel Matthieu. It's a brilliant decision, given that the locals create the feel of a documentary. At several points I had to remember this was a movie and not just newsreel footage. It gets that much more raw as you watch the scenes where the Algerians engage in guerrilla war against first the French police and then later the French military. It only escalates when you watch the French government return the favor in a way one might have wished a government not to. The director is expert, however, at showing exactly how both sides get their hands dirty. Pontecorvo is honestly what makes this work. His eye for detail, for the little things that insurgents would do to make their insurgency effective, is uncanny. One feels like this movie should have been required watching for the US foreign policy establishment (both civilian and military) in the run-up to Iraq in 2003 with a big test at the end that is a single question: ""What do you think the lesson here was?"" If the answer is something other than ""You can't win wars of occupation,"" then the viewer has to go back and watch again. In short, see this for the setting. See this for the direction and the story. See it for the music. But most of all, see it because it's an exceptional film that depicts a less well-known portion of history only a scant few years after it happened and isn't afraid to make you flinch at what it finds.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/63146i/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_032717/dfqlr6s/)

* [**Thelma and Louise** (1991) - Was doing the inevitable long scroll through titles trying to decide what to watch, and settled on this one purely because, holy shit, Ridley Scott directed this? Reading the IMDB page it seemed utterly unlike anything I'd associate with him (the poster made it look like some cartoonish comedy). Plus I knew next to nothing about it except who played the two leads, so I decided to give it a shot. This movie's a hell of a lot of fun. And heartfelt, too. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon do fantastic work as the titular characters, and as a whole (with cinematography especially) it has a very stylish, big budget feel. Lot's of dust, chrome, neon, and brown desert rock, captured in wide-open landscape shots, backed by a kickass Hanz-Zimmer 90's guitar score. And it does feel *super* 90's. I'd say it almost feels like a period piece actually, in tone and visuals, capturing a real slice of early 90's Americana. You might consider it a flaw in some respects...it can sometimes be pretty cloying and cheesy, and the ending goes full-90's with explosions and an epic police chase (complete with crashing cruisers). Or you might find those aspects perfect in what I can only describe as a Top Gun/Point Break kind of way. But I think the underlying themes and character work elevate it a lot. It's a great script (the direction and Hans Zimmer-ish excess are just a fun bonus). And not to hammer the obvious point home, but it struck me watching this how rare it is to get a major crime/adventure movie headlined by two (relatively) older women. At the end of the day, it's super fun and very worth your time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/63146i/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_032717/dfqkzhr/)

* [**Unbreakable** - The thing about Unbreakable is that we can't see it today without taking in consideration the complete nosedive of Shyamalan's career. For many, this is his last ""great"" film, and for quite a few, his best. Ever since I first watched it, the thing that struck me the most was how emotionally charged it is. Shyamalan conducts the whole movie in a masterful way, that's no secret, but the thing is that he makes sure we understand the characters first and foremost, and that's the movie's triumph. When we look at Elijah, for instance, we instantly recognize exactly what drove him to the state he is now. His obsessions are crazy, but somehow we buy it, just like Bruce Willis' character does. This is, of course, merit of Samuel L Jackson's performance, who manages to give an extremely frail vibe while still looking extremely menacing. I'd say that this is the movie Shyamalan gets the most right when it comes to a marriage between screenplay and directing. He usually shoots scenes from behind other objects, as to pass a vouyer vibe, like we're not supposed to be there. His management of long takes is also really impressive, as it builds the tension to extreme heights. I can't tell for sure if this is his best, or his last ""great"" film (I, for one, like Signs and The Visit quite a lot). But one thing is for sure, there has never been another movie like this. Not from Shyamalan, neither from the many copycats he spawned. It's a rare film, and we should cherish that, despite the rough patches Shyamalan's career went through.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/61maj9/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_032017/dffjy34/)

* [**Everybody Wants Some!!** - It's been on my list since seeing the first trailer, but I never got around to seeing it. I'd heard the praise, and I have loved Dazed and Confused since first seeing it as a freshman in college in 1999, when it hit home during the start of my ""what the hell am I doing with my life"" phase. I'd been putting off EWS till I was in the mood, and finally watched it a couple nights ago. Possibly one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever seen. Like just about all the other reviews said, I think I was smiling the entire time. IMO, it captured, better than any other movie, that mystical period of arriving at college and immediately forming bromances and romances and developing your budding personal philosophies under the influence of hot summer nights and lots of alcohol. I really appreciated the utter lack of real conflict. It was basically a carefree summer night, in movie form. I've also been wading through what I guess you'd call a mid-life crisis, or the adult version of the ""now what the hell am I doing with my life"" phase, thinking a lot about missed opportunities when I was young, when I worried way too much about the ""what ifs"" and was no good at living in the moment. So the live-for-the-now aspect of the movie really resonated with me, especially McReynolds' quote ""This is the best day of my life. Until tomorrow"". I can see myself watching Everybody Wants Some at least once a month, or whenever I need a little shot of happy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/61maj9/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_032017/dffuaw5/)

* [Brian DePalma's **The Untouchables** is a model of what a mainstream, fun action-suspense film should strive for. The film quickly establishes the characters and stakes, and takes you along a ride that, while it mostly sticks to the Hollywood screenwriting playbook, throws in a couple of really good twists right when the audience isn't expecting it (or at least when *I* wasn't expecting it). What elevates this movie from good to great for me are a couple of scenes in the second half that are showcases in how to ratchet up tension, surprise the viewer, and just throw in some fun, artistic flair to the mix. I really, really enjoyed Robert De Niro's turn as Al Capone, portraying him with gesticulations and speech patterns that reminded me of a certain recently-elected political figure. I'm a little on-the-fence with regards to Costner's performance - I think sometimes he can just be kind of bland, but in all I thought he was fine. The supporting cast around Costner is quite strong. *The Untouchables* is a movie I wasn't expecting to like this much, but it's a big recommend from me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/61maj9/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_032017/dffmgl4/)

* [I saw **Before Sunrise** for the first time today, and I think it has really cemented my love for Linklater's work and style. I haven't seen the rest of the trilogy yet but I'm looking forward to it. First, can we talk about that insane Criterion transfer? I saw some screenshots of the original BluRay/DVDs and the difference is mindblowing. The colors seemed completely dry and mid-2000s-home-video-like on the original print, but Criterion restored them perfectly and I think that the new version is the only one that does justice to the film itself. Please watch this on Criterion if you can. Now, for the movie itself. What makes it so bloody brilliant is Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke's chemistry. The two actors managed to capture the feeling of fleeting love perfectly, and they seemed to be having as much fun as the characters did. While yeah, the dialogue did get quite pretentious and over-the-top in parts, it was interesting and mumblecore-y like the other Linklater flicks and kept me hooked on. It does feel like it was playing out in retrospect, where the characters are more self-aware of their situation than anyone in their position would be, but I guess it says a lot about this particular style of filmmaking and writing. There were some fascinating long-takes in the movie, especially the one on the tram with the two characters asking each other personal questions. The visuals did a great job at capturing the *moment*. They didn't overdo it with cuts and the shallow depth of field helped focus on the dialogue and characters even with those amazing Viennese landscapes in the background. I could go on and on about Linklater's brilliance but I don't want to, here's what I will say - **Before Sunrise** is an ode to what is so great about romantic cinema and it transcends the boundaries of character relationships. It makes you feel passionate for the story but doesn't indulge in the gratituousness of young love. It's the perfect romance film and I'm excited to see the rest of the trilogy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/60a5qa/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_031317/df4qylu/)

* [**The Insider** - Movies based on real events can often be either too dry or too sensationalized, but The Insider finds the perfect balance and is an extraordinarily compelling film. I liked both the leads a lot-Crowe ably navigates a role that combines intense paranoia, anger, intelligence, coldness and aloofness, and it’s one of the last times Pacino actually tried in a movie. Also, Plummer (as Mike Wallace) is terrific and I love his characterization in general since I was never really a fan of Wallace in general. I loved the screenplay for a number of reasons. First, it’s a great thriller, especially with the paranoia that’s pervasive throughout the first half (the scene at the driving range being my favorite, with perfect pacing, editing and cinematography). Second, it’s very dedicated to historical accuracy, something I think is important in a movie with explosive allegations and negative characterizations about people when the events happened just four years before the movie came out. Third, in a different telling of this story, we might get more broad and obvious characterizations, but here we get much richer portraits, like with Crowe’s character, who is clearly heroic by putting everything on the line for the right cause, but is also unpersonable and prone to anger. The other thing that stood out to me was the cinematography and editing, which felt very “modern” (for better or worse). Lots of rapid-fire cuts, heavy use of steadicam, off-kilter close-ups, and switching the focus from the foreground to the background (or vice versa) within the same shot-it certainly looks distinctive. I think it gives a dynamic feel to the movie, and in the context of a thriller like this, it works well. Making a compelling, true-to-real-life-events thriller with themes about monied interests and media influence that are more relevant today than ever is an incredibly difficult task, yet The Insider somehow gets everything right. This was the high point for Michael Mann’s career, a bit of a swan song for Pacino, and a movie that further established Crowe as maybe the top actor for the time period.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/60a5qa/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_031317/df4rmth/)

* [**Yi Yi** - Probably the 3rd time I saw this masterpiece by the late Edward Yang. When I first saw it, I was probably still a kid in middle school - I have absolutely no idea what this film is about except that it's way too long. When I watched it the second time, I was in college, just starting to become a regular movie fan and watching all kinds of films (blockbuster/indie/foreign/classics/etc) - still, I'm not 100% sure why this is considered one of the best films in the 21st century; I do remember that the final words regarding getting old by Yang Yang really stuck with me. This time around, however, after I've seen much more films over the past couple years and have way better understanding of what makes a great film, I was absolutely absorbed by this film. I now consider it the best Chinese language movie of all time (although that doesn't say much since... not much competition really), and I think it's even better than another Yang's masterpiece - A Brighter Summer Day, which by a lot of people is considered his magnum opus. The story of Yi Yi is so specific and small, yet it becomes more and more ""epic"" and universal when time goes by. By the end of the film, I'm surprised by how many small things that I can relate to, and how deeply I can relate to them. The language of the film does not feel cinematic at all - the camera is such an observant and it never gets in my way, but the way the story unfolds and different montages are presented can never be achieved in other medium than film. It does not hit you as a tear-jerker, it doesn't try to manipulate your emotion, it lays out the story for you in the most straightforward way possible. But at the same time, it is profoundly poignant and tender, giving me chance to relate to all the characters in this film.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/60a5qa/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_031317/df4q7ye/)

* [This week I saw **Manchester by the Sea.**
Manchester by the Sea was an incredible experience for me, as a kind of antithesis to La La Land (which I also loved, just to clarify). Casey Affleck is an actor with whom I am not too familiar, and this really helped cement his performance as Lee as something incredibly raw and believable, especially with regards to the central trauma he suffers which underlies the whole film. This trauma is not treated as a big, third-act reveal - it is revealed close to the middle of the movie - which I found to be exceptionally effective, not only in the matter-of-fact way in which it is revealed, but in also providing an incredible amount of empathy and understanding towards Lee for the rest of the film. Having not seen Affleck in too many other films, a kind of genuineness was brought to his character in ways which few other films have achieved for me. I love scripts with realistic dialogue and this film provided that on a huge scale, most notably between Lee and his nephew, who also gives a great performance as a character to whom I found myself relating quite a fair amount. Also, I'm a sucker for a Boston accent. I'm still thinking about this film. I think I might be for some time. I came out thinking 'boy, I don't want to see that again for a while', and the next day I thought the exact opposite. It's a beautiful powerhouse of a film and I can't wait to see it again.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5s4bwp/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_013017/ddcbs9j/)

* [**The Net** (2016) - Kim Ki-duk. People should really give this a watch. It's about a North Korean fisherman who accidentally drifts across the border to South Korea when his boat engine breaks down. When he gets taken in by the authorities as a suspected spy, he suffers a Kafkaesque nightmare, where the only thing he wants is to return to his wife and young daughter. The film is as good as you'd expect from a filmmaker like Kim Ki-duk. Brutal, heartbreaking, infuriating, but ultimately very human. The performance by Ryoo Seung-Bum is absolutely brilliant, and you really feel for him during his awful predicament. It's also a brilliant satire, and a damning indictment of both South Korea's treatment of suspected spies, and of course the North Korean dictatorship. 8/10 in my book.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5s4bwp/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_013017/ddc9pkz/)

* [**Letter's From Iwo Jima** - Probably one of the best anti war movies along with Paths of Glory. Shows just how badly propaganda skews our perception of the other side. The other side isn't human. The other side are untrained savages. The other side isn't as good as us. I loved how it showed the Japanese perspective on what they all knew was a doomed battle. There was no way they could win but they just accepted their fate ahead of time. And the story about the dog will always always stick in my head forever. It's just so brutally sad... And it's all done in Clint Eastwood's classic minimalistic style. My only flaw with it is it didn't show time passing well. They were actually stuck on Iwo Jima a very long time but it feels like it all takes place over a single night but it sometimes says months have passed. It would've felt more grueling if they showed time pass more smoothly. Honestly one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's just so effective and I honestly hate that quote people always say that it's impossible to make an anti war movie because filming war is intrinsically exciting which undermines the anti war message. Anyone who's said that hasn't seen Letters From Iwo Jima (or Paths of Glory). You feel so conflicted seeing ""the good guys"" being the enemy and the enemies coming are americans. Like honestly, I hate that quote cause it's so final in its wrongness. But yeah, I personally think this is Clint Eastwood's best masterpiece.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5s4bwp/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_013017/ddcdkhp/)

* [Robert Altman's **Popeye** - 1980, starring Robin Williams as Popeye, and Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl. Everybody said this movie sucks. ""You owe me an apology!"" Okay - one or two of the songs are a little meh (""I'm Mean"" is laughably bad), and the finale is a bit lackluster (Popeye doesnt eat his spinach until the last 5 minutes of the movie. The Octopus is AWFUL - it reminded me of that scene in *Ed Wood*). And maybe it should have been 90 minutes instead of 115. But it's funny, and it's sweet, and the film creates it's own little world of Sweet Haven and fills it with some great music and familiar characters and cartoonish sight-gags (Bluto ""seeing red"" and ""turning yellow"" are my favorites). Shelley Duvall has never been so funny and endearing as in *Popeye*. I had no idea the ""He Needs Me"" song from Paul Thomas Anderson's *Punch-Drunk Love* came from this movie. That, and ""Sailin"" have been stuck in my head all week.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5qv20q/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_012317/dd2crnt/)

* [**Demolition** with Jake Gyllenhaal, Naomi Watts, Chris Cooper, and Judah Levine. Came in about 1/3rd of the way into the movie because it was in cable, being a big fan of Gyllenhaal and having heard nothing about the movie, I got pulled in and I'm happy I did. I dig movies that explore pretty dark themes and carry intense emotional content, much like almost all of Gyllenhaal's past films and this one did not disappoint, while also providing some good laughs and dark humor . Gyllenhaal is an investment banker who suffers a brief identity crisis after the tragic death of his wife, providing a very honest look into the very strange ways human beings work through tragedy and trauma on their own time and their own ways, as well as reexamining his own life before building a new future for themselves by picking it all apart. His boss, Chris Cooper, was also the father of his wife, playing the father-in-law and high-powered corporate figure which I think represents the life Gyllenhaal is now questioning. After some time, Gyllenhaal tracks down Naomi Watt's character, striking up a strange, but interesting relationship with her and her teenage son. The interactions between all three are heartfelt and honest, and the exchanges between Gyllenhaal and Levine provide an excellent source of awkward amusement and humor throughout the film as he steps in as sort of a social father for the child Watts is having trouble controlling, but who is working through his own issues with identity as well. Great ending and an excellent film, if you're a fan of Gyllenhall as an actor id definitely recommend checking it out 8/10](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5qv20q/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_012317/dd2gd33/)

* [**Spellbinder** (1988) - Saw the film Spellbinder last night, and I sure didn't expect it to be that good as it was in the horror section of Amazon Prime, which save for a few films, isn't that great. It's a fun, interesting and at times unnerving film with a competent story and great characters. Definitely worth checking out if you enjoy cult films (as in films about cults.) One of my favorite parts of the film is they set up things early in the film that later pay off, which to me is always a good time. The characters are fun, you immediately become invested in the main character Jeff's life and I found myself rooting for Jeff all the way through the film. The film stars Tim Daly (Wings; Voice of Superman in Superman the animated series) as Jeff and Kelly Preston (Jerry Maguire; Twins) as Miranda. Jeff rescues Miranda from a man who is abusing her and soon finds himself in trouble when the cult Miranda previously belongs to comes to take her back.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5qv20q/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_012317/dd2boc1/)

* [**Moonlight** is a tour de force through a life that's been scarred by fears and traumas, but Jenkins knows that it can be rebuilt. As a director, he challenges us. Lots of moments have the characters looking straight at the camera, sometimes to throw the spectator into the complete turmoil of Chiron, and sometimes to simply confide in us all of the anger and sadness contained in the character. That's not all Jenkins does. He often films the back of his characters, as if to symbolize the weight of the outside world and the characters' decisions cathcing up to them. During a very brief moment in the third act, we get a glimpse of love in Chiron's life, shared once again by Kevin, after succeeding in making his friend open up to him completely. It's a small and intimate moment, the one jenkins' chose to close his film. Much, much more to say about this, but much much more has already been said as well. It's a fantastic film that works both as a character study, as a study of our society, and as a coming-of-age drama that succeeds in every way possible. It's the kind of movie we need, it's an important statement made by a filmmaker that has showed amazing potential.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5pifmo/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_011617/dcrdm9n/)

* [**Raiders of the Lost Ark** - All of the Indiana Jones movies are on Amazon Instant Video now and I've been taking advantage. I loved these movies as a kid and they are still such a treat as an adult. The sense of adventure, dashes of humor, and great action is what makes Indy so much fun. Harrison Ford is basically perfect and the surrounding cast fits the atmosphere and movie just right. I'm currently on Temple of Doom and really looking forward to Last Crusade. If you haven't seen these films before or haven't seen them in years, definitely take the time to revisit them. Just straight out fun stuff!](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5pifmo/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_011617/dcrg1p4/)

* [**The Drop** with Tom Hardy - I'm surprised this one didn't get more attention, but then again 2014 was pretty insane year for cinema. I thought it was relatively unique for a crime movie; with an interesting low key set up over something bombastic and indulgent in it's violence and gore. All the actors are  fantastic and its a testament to Hardy's range as an actor, Bob is NOTHING like a usual tough guy Hardy character, he's awkward and anxious and quiet all kept to himself with a good heart, but with just the hint of something dangerous underneath it all. Shout out to the late Tony Soprano for one last great performance and Noomi Rapace, excited to see her again with Hardy in Taboo. Loved the twist [didn't watch the trailer that apparently spoiled it lmao] and the cinematography pulled it all together. Just a great damn movie.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5pifmo/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_011617/dcsbc33/)

* [Not a word hasn't been said about how **Singing in the Rain** is one of the best and most important movies of all time. People have been praising this classic for years, so I'll keep it short. Yes, Singing in the Rain IS one of the best movies of all time, and most likely the most important musical ever made. People have been borrowing from this for so long, yet no one was able to capture the magic of it in the right way. Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds are just a pure delight, and Donald O'Connor can't be praised enough for his amazing dancing. In fact, most dance numbers in here are flawless, and just admirable considering Kelly and O'Connor were actually the ones performing it. The movie is, at the end of the day, a huge love letter to the artistic side of all of us. It may come off as a satire of the Hollywood system, and it certainly is, but its heart ultimately lies in how love moves us, and how we express it through the most amazing and fantastic ways, if we do it right. Not enough can be said about how great this film is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5o4g5n/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_010917/dcghzlk/)

* [Just saw **Suicide Squad** for the second time (first time was in theaters months ago). While I hated it the first time I saw it, my second viewing had a far better outcome. Truth be told, I actually enjoyed it... a lot. I have no idea how that happened, but I think it has to do with the fact that I went into this with the mindset of ''Right, this is a shit movie but I'm going to watch it nonetheless just to see how shit it is.'' When you know that the movie is flawed and you go into it with no expectations, the entertainment value increases dramatically. What can I say? Deadshot was dope ''Is this some kind of suicide squad?'' (so terrible yet so funny!), El Diablo really grew on me, Harley Quinn's cringy jokes were awesome, and the Joker was so terrible, he ended up being my favourite character of them all. The whole thing is one big entertaining trainwreck and I love it. Two days ago, I thought Suicide Squad was one of the worst movies of the year. I still hold on to that opinion, but from now on, it's also one of the most amusing movies of the year and I'm so looking forward to seeing it a third time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5o4g5n/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_010917/dcgivpf/)

* [**Paterson** is currently only playing in like two theaters in Manhattan, and honestly, that's where it belongs. It's a slow artsy movie about a poet bus driver in Paterson, NJ named Paterson (Adam Driver). It's the kind of thing I really never thought I would like, or should like, but maybe I'm finally getting old and boring, because this was a lovely movie. The movie really doesn't have a plot as much as we see his daily routine of driving the bus, scribbling verses, being politely supportive to his crazy girlfriend's pretentious ideas, and having a drink at the bar. But this is such a lovely little movie - it's pleasant. Paterson seems like a person happy with his place in the world and finds artistic inspiration in it, even in how mundane everything is. Director Jim Jarmusch seems to genuinely like every character in his movie, filling it with loving quirks. (There are twins everywhere, Paterson's mailbox is always falling over, a truly bizarre scene with Masatoshi Nagase.) Plus Paterson features the best female performance of 2016 from Nellie, an adorable English bulldog. 13/10 dog.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5o4g5n/what_was_the_best_film_you_saw_this_week_010917/dcgkdi7/)

7,"How many of Hollywood stars wear lifts or use boxes to stand on or camera angles to make them appear taller or not so short with their co-stars? Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr are the first two that come to mind. Both are 5'7 and 5'8 (reportedly) but tend to favor 2/3 inch lifts in films. Not to mention also favoring camera angles to give them the impression of being taller. Is it more prevalent today or was is very typical in the past decades in the industry? Is it reflecting society's views on wanting leading men to be tall or at least taller than their female counterparts?

&#x200B;

How many roles has Cruise or Downey Jr or other shorter leading men missed out on due to their heights?"
7,"Films with great chemistry between the leads and films with terrible chemistry between the leads Films with great chemistry between the leads and films with terrible chemistry between the leads

Which  can you name? Was there reasons for why the chemistry was so Hot or so  Cold? was it a surprise? How did the film do with regard to the on  screen chemistry? any films where male friendships or female friendships  have better chemistry than the supposed romantic couple also in the film?"
7,"Actors and being billed. Examples of actors who argued to be billed over another or took an Uncredited for their apperance in a film [https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/oct/13/featuresreview.review1](https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/oct/13/featuresreview.review1)

> In film the ante is notched up even more, as can be seen by the  proliferation of film posters with one actor or another named in a box -  a sure sign of an aggressive agent - or one name lifted above another  in a kind of pyramid: Robert Shaw, for instance, whose name hovered  above Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss in the poster for Jaws. In 1969  Steve McQueen dropped out of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid because  he wouldn't give up top billing to Paul Newman. McQueen's replacement,  Robert Redford, 'was an also-ran' for the role, recalls octogenarian  producer David Brown.    
>  
>Five years later in Towering Inferno McQueen was desperate to see his  name above Newman's. In the end he was happy with the staggered billing  which saw his name and Newman's together on screen and on posters:  McQueen's was on the left and lower and Newman's on the right and higher  - which meant McQueen's was read first.

>At this point in his career, Will Ferrell could easily ditch the credits in *all* of  his films, and it wouldn't make a difference one way or another. He's  Will Ferrell. If you're a comedy fan and you see his face on a poster,  chances are you'll want to check it out.  
>  
>That said, he's also such a powerhouse in the world of comedy that were he to have his name attached to a movie in which he *wasn't* the  star, it's safe to say that his star power might detract from the  actual headliners themselves. So, being the cool dude that he is,  Ferrell went ahead and remained MIA in the credits for [***Wedding Crashers***](https://screenrant.com/tag/wedding-crashers/), allowing Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn to have their own time to shine.  
>  
>Doing this worked especially well, considering how much of a surprise  it was to see Ferrell show up more than halfway into the movie. In this  case, a bit of secrecy goes a long way."
7,Typecasted actors/actresses. who are the notable ones? Any A-listers who's careers died due to being typecast? Or are they only successful when they continue to play in the same genre or a character-type similar throughout several different films? Is typecasting far less career risky today than it was in the past? any actors or actresses you feel that are immune to typecasting? The type of performers who always take risks in their roles and just play whatever and whenever?
7,Director film salaries who are the most highest paid directors in Hollywood today? Are they paid any percentages of the film's gross or just a one lump sum? Does the MCU pay a lot to its directors or is it rather stingy with them? I was reading Jan de Bont got 5-6 million to direct Speed 2: Cruise Control and that sounds almost Insane. But he was coming off Speed and Twister so they  probably felt it was a worthy salary for him.
7,"What were they thinking? So, name films that just made absolutely no sense. Whether it was the plot or the cast/crew involved or just the way they marketed it to the audience. All of which led to the film being a blunder in the eyes of the public and resulting in a huge flop. I'm thinking of Speed 2 Cruise Control. Why exactly was this made? They couldn't even bring back Keanu Reeves. Seems rather pitiful that they felt they could do away with him and bring in Jason Patric as a replacement. Dafoe was excellent as the villain but the whole concept seemed to be lightning in a bottle and worked only once.  The result was a FLOP."
7,"I miss 1980s action films All of which were rated R. Hard R but there was of course some comedic elements to it without being self parody, usually in a Schwarzenegger film. Commando, Predator, Raw Deal come off the top of my head. Hell, even Stallone's COBRA is incredibly explosive and a treat to behold (though watching it a 2nd time might be a bit of a letdown). what are some 80s action films that you love?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehUvS5wMrwg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehUvS5wMrwg) 

&#x200B;

what are the noticeable differences between action films of the 80s and the 90s? how do action films today compare to the 80s version?"
7,"Jamie Foxx's leading man career So he's gone a long way in the industry. From comedian on In Living Color 30 years ago to having his very own tv series to doing god awful flicks like Booty Call. A supporting role in Any Given Stone changed his future. He then hooks up with Michael Mann and does 3 films with him over 5 years (Ali, Collaterral, Miami Vice). Oscar win in 2005 for Ray which was the very same year his film Stealth was a huge flop. He seemed to be on his way to being an A-list star. Big salaries and a lot of critical favorability. Doing films like Dreamgirls, The Kingdom, The Soloist, Law Abiding Citizen and others seemed to flop. Django Unchained is his biggest HIT ever and that was all on Quentin Tarantino. He was probably the best thing about White House Down but that was a Big Flop back in summer 2013. He was miscast in the Amazing Spiderman sequel. how's his career going? Is he still an A-lister you think? Has he lost his appeal or status in the industry?"
7,"Movies with budgets that surprised you. Either the budget is insanely too high or the budget is incredibly small How Do You Know was a romantic comedy released in 2010 starring Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, Paul Rudd and Jack Nicholson. The budget was $120 million. Nearly half the budget was cast salaries.

&#x200B;

Spiderman 3 in 2007 had a $258 million dollar budget. John Carter of Mars had a nearly 300 million dollar budget. 

The first Purge film in 2013 had a $3 million dollar budget. The first Saw in 2004 had a million dollar budget."
7,"What are some risky roles that actors/actresses took in films? Maybe the subject matter was quite controversial or maybe it was a risk for the actor/actress to work with the director. Perhaps it was a physical performance in which the actor/actress gained a lot of weight or simply lost an insane amount of weight. Maybe it was an actor playing the role of a homosexual in a time in which that might have damaged their career or perhaps a film featuring interracial sex scenes in a time where that wasn't mainstream acceptable. 

&#x200B;

Maybe others won't agree but I always felt that DiCaprio taking a supporting role in Django Unchained was a bit of a risk. He's taking on a role in which he's dropping the N-bomb like 50 times in the film. Now his fanbase aren't hardcore churchgoers but I gotta imagine many White American A-listers may have had to reconsider such a role as his in the film."
7,"Who are some really talented/well regarded actors who also produce or write their not only their starring films but other projects. We always discuss actors who also direct but what about those that are into producing films?

&#x200B;

I'd probably list Brad Pitt. His Plan B Entertainment produced quite a few of his films but also notable films like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Departed, 12 Years A Slave, Selma, Moonlight, Okja, If Beale Street Could Talk among others. Many of which are lower budget films that wouldn't have gotten much mainstream attention or financing without an A-list backing them."
7,"Which actor/actress have you seen the most of their films at the theater? For me, it's Jake Gyllenhaal with 7 films.

Brokeback Mountain, Zodiac, End of Watch, Nightcrawler, Southpaw, Life and The Sisters Brothers. Spidey 2 will be my 8th film of his.

&#x200B;

The closest to him would probably be probably Leo DiCaprio (The Departed, Shutter Island, Django Unchained) with plans to see Once Upon A Time in Hollywood in August. There's also Tom Cruise (War of The Worlds, Mission Impossible 3, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, Mission Impossible: Fallout).

&#x200B;

what about for you? List the actor/actress and all of their films you've seen at the theater."
7,"Controversial Film titles? How was it possible that one of Roger Moore's Bond films is titled ""Octopussy""? There was never any fears that it might have doomed the box office with negative PR? I'm surprised it wasn't retitled upon release in the US. Can you think of films in which the title was too controversial and retitled or perhaps they still got a release under the title?"
7,"Is it quite difficult for shorter than average leading men in Hollywood? For leading man roles, does it help to be an average 5'10 or does it help to be 6'1 or taller? How is it for the likes of men who happen to be 5'5? Michael J. Fox was 5'5 but he had plenty of movie roles, albeit in comedies. Dustin Hoffman also stands at 5'5 and he has been a leading man for decades. Though he's never been given hearthrob roles that Robert Redford would have gotten or charismatic roles like Steve McQueen. Do you think Tom Cruise's career has been hindered at all by his 5'7 height?"
7,"Random Actors with odd or surprising roles in a film Luke Perry was in The Fifth Element. He was in the beginning of the film for a good four or five minutes. Not sure why he was cast as he was a big tv star and having such a small role in a French funded big budget sci-fi action film.

&#x200B;

Any other suprise appearances or small roles by big stars in films that kinda threw you for a loop."
7,Why are they doing a sequel to Top Gun? it's been over 30 years. It just seems way out of date. Top Gun was a typical 80s popcorn film but the soundtrack and Tom Cruise's charm helped boost that film to over 350 million worldwide. I can see it being a HIT next summer but I don't see it taking in some crazy number like 800 million. I guess I feel it'll be underwhelming for most and leave a bad taste with regard to the first film. I'm really surprised Cruise is doing this.
7,"Why has it been pretty much difficult for the US to have an Asian-American leading man/woman A-list star? how many Asian-American A-listers can you think of? I can think of Mindy Kaling but she's not even an A-list tv star; mostly known for writing/producing/starring in The Office as well as her own show that ran a few years. There's Lucy Liu who was a supporting star on Ally McBeal in the late 90s and parlayed that to a film career in which was in two Charlie's Angels films, Shanghai Noon, Ecks vs Server, Kill Bill and Lucky Number Slevin. She's now on tv's Elementary which ran for seven years. Now what about leading men?

&#x200B;

John Cho comes to mind. A career of supporting roles in films. Probably best known as being in 3 Star Trek films and the recent film Searching. Steven Yeun of The Walking Dead has had roles in films recently but no leading man chances. Randall Park of Fresh Off the Boat. There was the guy who played Han in several Fast and the Furious films but that's a supporting role at best. 

&#x200B;

but none of these are A-listers are they? so why is that? Asian Americans aren't given the same opportunities as White or even Black stars. Are things changing?"
7,"How prevalent are lifts in Hollywood? Tom Cruise is 5'7 and Robert Downey Jr is 5'7 or 5'8. Both are reported for wearing lifts and tons of photos that show that. But how popular are lifts for leading men in the industry? I've even heard rumors that Brad Pitt wore lifts, but that seems crazy a 5'11 guy would wear them. Are they just useful to convey that a man is tall and thus more in line with what we feel a leading man should be."
7,"Taraji P. Henson's career. 10 years ago, she was known mostly for Baby Boy and an Oscar nominated role in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. She then spent a few years on No Person of Interest. Lead roles in Think Like A Man and No Good Deed with supporting roles in Date Night and Larry Crowne. Her breakthrough role as Cookie in Empire helped grab several more leading roles. Since, then she's done Hidden Figures, Proud Mary, Acrimony, and What Women Want.

&#x200B;

does she have range? Is she the most high-profile Black actress or is that Viola Davis or Lupita Nyongo'o? Is she underrated?"
7,"What happened to the suspense/thriller genre? I remember 20 years ago stepping into a Blockbuster and there'd be loads of films fitting under the label of Suspense or Mystery or Thriller. And then 10 years ago as Blockbuster was dying off, there was simply Horror, Action, Drama, Comedy and barely a section for Sci-Fi.

&#x200B;

Did Hollywood get more clever packaging suspense/thrillers within drama or horror genres? Did they just give up on films marketed heavily in that genre as they felt audiences were passing on those films?

&#x200B;

any suspense/thriller films of this decade that you'd recommend or that you feel really stand the test of time? Any worthy of being discussed among the classic suspense/thrillers of the past?"
7,"What are films that define and accurately depict a decade or era? &#x200B;

What are films that define and accurately depict a decade or era?

whether it's a film made during that decade itself or perhaps it's a film that's produced decades later and adequately portrays what life was like back during that  period? Are there any that you can think of? What might be 5 or 10 films that you'd suggest that meets the bill for that period or decade?"
7,"What went wrong with 2013's World War Z? Is it simply the fact that it should have been a tv series or a miniseries at least?

&#x200B;

You had a 150 million dollar film starring a huge movie star by the name of Brad Pitt. Could it have been much better than what it was? Should it have been rated R? was it the story or the CGI that was underwhelming for many?"
7,"Why don't we see many Australian films getting released internationally? There's at least half a dozen A-list Australian stars and a dozen or so more if you include tv stars or Aussies who tend to get supporting roles in blockbusters or leads in films that folks maybe avoid seeing. I recall reading the Australian film industry had its heyday in the 80s with lots of films earning praise and $$ overseas. Mad Max trilogy comes straight to mind. 

&#x200B;

Not to mention quite a few Australian directors making it BIG in Hollywood. So, why don't we see Australian films released in the US? Maybe not enough for a full wide-release but something like what many British films get (500 or so theaters). Is it just the accent that might be deemed a turn off for people or subject matter? And why don't we see some Hollywood films with Australian characters as the protagonist? 

&#x200B;

One would think the power of Australian actors/actresses and directors might be enough to get some Australian stories told internationally. Like 2008's Australia which had a HUGE budget though maybe that was mostly a US financed production."
7,"What's Lupita Nyong'o up to next? &#x200B;

US  turned out to be a Huge Hit though maybe most of that was sold on  Jordan Peele's name. But she did a ton of PR for it. Black Panther was a  HUGE hit and that's great for her to have been a part of. She has that  female spy thriller ""355"" which has been in pre-production for the past  year as well as the John Woo remake of ""The Killer"". I recall also she  and Viola Davis were linked to do a film together.

I  hope to see her get those films done and do something quite different.  Perhaps a comedy or a musical. Just nothing that requires her to play a  CGI voice."
7,"Matthew McConaughey's future as a leading man? Is he in a run of bad luck or is he seriously in dire trouble for his career? 

&#x200B;

Free State of Jones (which I liked) and The Dark Tower were big flops.  The Sea of Trees went straight to VOD. White Boy Rick was a misfire though he got real good reviews for the role. The Beach Bum got him incredible praise with some calling it the performance of his career but it was also a flop. Serenity was a big flop and among the worst films reviewed of the year. 

&#x200B;

you think he can turn things around? Has his career gone the way you expected after he won an Oscar? what would you like to see him do next?"
7,"Actors/Actresses turning down iconic roles that made a superstar of the actor who took the role. So for example, Chris O'Donnell who's mostly famous for playing Robin in 2 Batman films turned down the role of Agent J in Men in Black. Will Smith was later cast in the role which became a huge hit which helped solidify himself as an A-list star. Now it may not have been a hit if say O'Donnell kept the role, but we'll never know.

&#x200B;

any others that you're aware of? Not only the stars turning down a film, but it then being given to another actor/actress who used it to propel their career."
7,"Foreign actors/actresses/filmmakers who you feel could have been major successes in Hollywood or surprised that they were not Vincent Cassell. Tall good-looking French guy. Best known in the US for Ocean's Twelve as well as Eastern Promises and Black Swan. He seems to have been among the top stars in France (of his generation). I'm surprised he never became a bigger star in the US. Sure, he's had parts in some great films but he's also done many supporting roles as a villain in say Child 44 and Derailed. Maybe his accent is too strong and he could never pull of playing an American or Brit. Maybe he simply never found material that he liked and preferred staying in France as a leading man.

&#x200B;

are there some foreign stars or filmmakers you feel that Hollywood missed out on? some you feel could have really been quite famous here or maybe you're shocked they never achieved a certain bit of notorioty here?"
7,"Best Male Actors born in the 1970s and 80s? So for the current leading male generation, who's given the absolute best performance? who's been really consistent with  good/great performances? who do you feel has done the most risky projects or changes it up?

&#x200B;

Ethan Hawke? Matt Damon? Jeremy Renner? Jude Law? Leo DiCaprio? Christian Bale? Joaquin Phoenix? Bradley Cooper? Tom Hardy? Michael Fassbender? James McAvoy? James Franco?  Jake Gyllenhaal? Ryan Gosling? Ben Foster? Joseph Gordon-Levitt? Eddie Redmayne?  Jonah Hill? 

&#x200B;

who do you feel might be most underrated?

&#x200B;

My fav would be Jake Gyllenhaal but the best performer would have to be between Phoenix and Bale. Bale's best performance being The Fighter while Phoenix's best being The Master. I really feel Phoenix has the best consistency in his work. He really does a lot of indies and dark material same with Gyllenhaal. I feel the most underrated would be Ben Foster or perhaps James Franco (since he does a lot of films and many turn out to be crap, we forget the good gems)."
7,"Are we seeing a somewhat special moment for Black actors/actresses and filmmakers in Hollywood now? Has there been a significant Change or is it only temporary? Is it tv where the better roles for African-Americans are? Denzel has been an A-lister for the past 30 years. Samuel L. Jackson has been a certified coolest MOFO for like 25 years now. Morgan Freeman has been in just about everything. There's been leading roles for Don Cheadle, Wesley Snipes, Laurence Fishburne, Forest Whitaker going back since the 90s though theyre mostly in supporting roles today. Will Smith was among the highest paid actors for like a decade or more. 

&#x200B;

Idris Elba keeps being Hyped as the next Big Star. Doing artsy films and big budget ones. You have the likes of Michael B. Jordan and Chadwick Boseman riding the massive appeal of Black Panther. Anthony Mackie is getting more opportunities now. 

&#x200B;

It does seem its quite difficult for Black actresses to really gain a foothold. There's Viola Davis whose doing tv and films. Taraji P. Henson is doing the same though her movies tend to fly under the radar. Tessa Thompson seems to be the next Big Thing in the industry. Lupita Nyong'o has finally shown she can open a film. A long way since the 90's when it was just Angela Bassett, Whoopi Goldberg and Whitney Houston who got the leading roles in the industry. Halle Berry had a lot of leading roles in the 00s but most were flops. 

&#x200B;

What about filmmakers? Ryan Coogler, Jordan Peele, Barry Jenkins, Ava DuVernay all seem to be headlining worthy projects that get a lot of attention and credit."
7,"Any films that are centered around female sports stars or female athletes? There must be some, but it escapes me. 

 I can think of Ladybugs but that was a '92 comedy with Rodney Dangerfield in which his son pretends to be a girl so that he can play on the soccer team and ensure they win.

 There's Bend it Like Beckham but that's equally about cultural differences. It's probably the most widely known female sports film.

&#x200B;

can you think of any? why don't we have more? Especially about soccer and basketball or tennis or softball. All popular sports for women. There's gotta be quite a few A-list stars who could pull this off."
7,"Why isn't Anthony Mackie a bigger star? &#x200B;

He's  been in everything. You may have missed him up until he made his MCU appearance in the first Captain America sequel.

His notable roles were in 8 Mile/She Hate Me/Million Dollar Baby/Half Nelson/The Hurt  Locker/Detroit/

It seems like he was always hyped up to be the next Denzel but  somehow it never came. So many supporting roles. And then he latches onto the role as Falcon and suddenly people are aware of who he is.

&#x200B;

He was also in Pain&Gane with Mark Wahlberg and The Rock though he didn't get credited above the title; he was in The Night Before with Seth Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He was in The Adjustment Bureau with Matt Damon. He was in Gangster Squad with Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling. He was in Our Brand Is Crisis with Sandra Bullock.  For quite a while, he was always the 2nd or 3rd lead in a film opposite some A-lister and credited like 3rd or 4th in a film yet somehow it never lead to a lead in a big film. 

&#x200B;

He's currently in the new season of Black Mirror and starring on the 2nd season of Altered carbon (due out sometime next year).

Just kinda surprised he isn't a bigger star. Dude has some real talent and has been in a ton of indie films in his career. Maybe he's lost his momentum. He was up and coming alongside Derek Luke who is basically forgotten today. Maybe Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan stole his thunder?

Maybe  it's a case of having the right agent or the right charisma or simply  being lucky at the right time. (I mean how does Hemsworth keep getting  lead roles despite every single film flopping).

&#x200B;

I def recommend his filmography if you guys enjoy him as Falcon."
7,"The career of Emilio Estevez Is he the most 80s actor you can think of? Probably his best work (and most memorable) is from that decade. He was part of the Brat Pack. He was also the youngest actor to direct a film for a major film studio (at age 23). I gotta wonder what exactly happened to his career in the 90s. Was he just not a very good actor or did he pick the wrong scripts? He wasn't a box office star like Tom Cruise nor did he take risky roles like Sean Penn, but he was as good a star as his brother Charlie Sheen or Rob Lowe or is that a wrong assessment?

&#x200B;

what's your favorite role of his? what's his worst performance? do you enjoy his directed films?"
7,"What's the fastest film career you have ever seen crash and burn? &#x200B;

What's the fastest film career you have ever seen crash and burn, whether male or female,?

&#x200B;

Say it's a rising star. Some young or middle aged actor who has been given a  shot at an A-list leading career. How fast did they flame out? what was the reason why? was it something behind the scenes? Were they just box office poison? Did they pick the wrong projects and piss off the wrong people? did they appear in any notable films before the flame out? did they just disappear or did they adjust to just supporting roles in films?"
7,"Whats the biggest budget film from each country? This can include co-productions or even Hollywood films produced in a country. Like for example, Mad Max:Fury Road cost like 180 milliom and was filmed in Namibia but it wasnt a local production. Im curious about the biggest budget film from every country. And how did these films do at the local box office. Was the funding mostly from the government? Were the budgets o heavy due to special effects or maybe it was a war epic?"
7,"The film career of Jake Gyllenhaal What are your thoughts on Jake? Is he among the best actora of his generation? What do you feel is his best and worst performance? Does he possess a lot of range as a performer or does he stick to a certain typecast? Has he worked with enough top directors? Has he asked big blockbusters in favor of darker, less audience-friendly projects?"
7,"Tom Cruise vs Brad Pitt? Tom Cruise vs Brad Pitt?

which has the better filmography? which has given the best performance of the 2? which has done worse films or given more (the most) terrible performance? which would you say has taking the greatest risk in a performance? which was snubbed for an Oscar nod or award for a specific performance?

&#x200B;

which has the most range?"
7,"Non British/Australian/Kiwi actors who can pull off various American accents? Is he one of the few foreign actors who can really pull off various American accents? Sure, we always state how British actors can do this. And Aussies and Kiwis to a degree as well. But Matthias Schoenaerts is from Belgium and grew up speaking Flemish and French. His wikipedia post states he learned English via American films as a kid. He was excellent in The Drop opposite Tom Hardy and his accent in The Loft was spot-on. I was surprised he wasn't American after seeing him in the last.

&#x200B;

there's also Michiel Husiman ( Dutch) who can also do a fantastic job of doing American accents."
7,"Huge Budget Chinese Action Flicks Any that you feel you'd recommend? Are they becoming box office hits in China? Have you seen any at your local cinema or do you feel that over the next few years, we will be seeing more and more of them?

&#x200B;

I'm currently watching Wolf Warrior 2 and also planning to see Operation Red Sea; essentially Chinese versions of the typical Michael Bay churned out blockbuster. It's interesting to see the Chinese do the same concept but place themselves in the cliche American role of ""Hero"". I suppose we're soon to see the ""Chinese savior"" trope in more and more films. 

&#x200B;

has anyone seen the Wandering Earth?"
7,"Contemporary action and war films from Europe? Are there any that you can think of? I'm aware that most European countries don't aim for action films or perhaps don't have the big enough budgets to do them justice, but surely there are some Dutch or Portuguese war films and gotta be a few Polish and Belgian action films. I'm sure there are a lot from the past, but I'm thinking of those in the last 25-30 years. Any that are current as of now?"
7,"Foreign war films set during the Afghan war/Iraq war &#x200B;

any that you can think of?

&#x200B;

I watched a Spanish film set during the Afghan war. It was about the rescue of a downed helicopter. Pretty solid. Some decent action (albeit low budget). I believe it was based on a true account.

There was also a Polish war film set during the Iraq war. Battle of Karbala if I'm correct. That was quite interesting. 

&#x200B;

I also saw (some years ago) a French film on their special forces unit (led by Djimon Hounsou) trying to rescue Diane Kruger from some quasi-Taliban types. Pretty generic. Not sure how it was received in France."
7,"For potential movie stars from tv series, is it far better today that more and more are on series that have 8-13 episodes a season that frees them up to get more film roles?  

&#x200B;

I remember back in the days of the 90's where so many popular tv series (The X-Files, Beverly Hills 90210, ER) you'd have 24-32 episode long seasons that would film like 9-10months out of the year. It was no wonder that the stars of these shows would get many opportunities for starring vehicles. But today it seems more and more that tv stars on limited series of 8 episodes or Netflix/HBO series (of 10-13 episodes) seem to have far more luck/opportunity in getting cast in some considerable productions. Do you believe it's a coincidence? Is it just that the actors are talented and getting recognized. But would that still occur if the shows they were on had 24-28 episodes a year?

thoughts?"
7,"Should they have killed off Rhodey/War Machine in Civil War?  

&#x200B;

or  would that have really soured the mood of the argument? how do you  think audiences might have reacted? would it have perfectly shown the  stakes of a superhero film where major characters could (and would) die?

Or is it better that we see that Rhodey was permanently injured due to the fight?

&#x200B;

though they did kinda forget that injury in the next film."
7,"Why is it that we have so few Hollywood films taking place in Canada or featuring Canadian characters? So many Hollywood films may take place abroad, but so few seem to take place in Canada. I can think of Scott Pilgrim as the only blockbuster that took place in Canada and had a cast of Canadian characters. Mainly since it was based on a Canadian comic. But why don't we have more? 

&#x200B;

There's a bunch of blockbusters that have a setting in the UK and might have British and American characters. Is it seemingly possible to feature Canadian characters? It's not as if somehow American audiences would be turned off by Canadian characters. American teens can relate to Degrassi just as well as any other US teen drama. 

&#x200B;

Deadpool's Canadian but takes place in the US. Could it just as easily take place in Canada?"
7,"Any European films with an American actor in the lead role or American character as the protagonist? Any European films with an American actor in the lead role or American character as the protagonist?

&#x200B;

So, a film made by Europeans and filmed/taking place in Europe with an American actor in the lead/American character as the protagonist. Can you think of any at all? 

&#x200B;

Is it a foreign language film or is it in English?"
7,"Film budgets that seriously shocked you. Whether it's because the budget is massively higher or massively lower than you would have imagined. The 2010 romantic comedy ""How Do You Know"". It cost 120 million dollars. Same budget as 2009's Watchmen (just as a comparison). 40% of the comedy's budget went directly to the leading cast and the director.

The horror film Purge (of 2013) had a budget of just a measly 3 million dollars.

I was surprised that Titanic had a budget of 200 million back in 1997. I'm not sure how much of that was delays, but hard to imagine it was greenlit with such a budget when the average film of the time was around 50 million. "
7,"Is Lupita Nyongo'o an A-lister now? She won her Oscar 5 years ago. But for most of the last few years she was mostly playing CGI characters in Star Wars and the Jungle Book. A year ago she was in Black Panther (and has the sequel coming up) and now US (opened to $70 million) which she is billed 1st. Supposedly she's set to star in a John Woo remake as well as part of an international ensemble of female spies led by Jessica Chastain.

is she A-list in your opinion?"
7,"what are your thoughts on the acting ability of Tom Cruise? Is he a good actor? Is he among the best of his generation? Do you feel he has little acting range beyond his stereotypical roles? Is he massively overlooked? Or do you feel people conflate box office success/popular among audiences with that of actual acting range? Has Cruise been a victim of his very own success with mainstream audiences? Could he have gotten many of the roles that say Sean Penn or Johnny Depp got in the 80's and 90's?

what's been his best performance?

why do you think he gave up on chasing the Oscar like 15 years ago? why so many action films of the past decade?
"
7,"Is Lupita Nyongo' the most famous African actor or actress ever? I'd imagine she's the most globally recognizable. Could we see her use her fame and A-list status to get more films African-centric or get some African talent into the industry? Do you feel her success might make it easier for future African talent to manage well in Hollywood or is she kinda an anomaly? After her Oscar win, she was stuck doing CGI work in Star Wars and the Jungle Book, but with Black Panther and US, she def is an indemand star.  "
7,"what are some notorious Hollywood scandals and what are some overlooked ones? Can you think of any? Notorious scandals in the industry that are common knowledge (even decades after the fact) as well as those scandals that were brushed under the rug and kept hidden from the public. can you think of those overlooked ones? 

I'm particularly curious in the little known scandals primarily from the Classical Age of Hollywood.

"
7,who is the biggest/popular A-lister who you feel truly can not act or who happens to have little range and yet still continue to get leading man/woman roles? Is there an actor or actress who you really believe can not act or has so little range that it makes you ponder how they got to the top? Do you think they made it because of who they banged or who they happen to be related to? Any particular ones whose careers are still pretty at the top despite their poor acting ability? Any who happened to shock you with a really good performance or any who you feel somehow got award nomination by accident?
7,"Can you think of any actors or actresses whose careers who ended not due to box office or their acting ability but because of behind the scenes dealings that put a nail in the coffin of their career. Actors' careers who ended not due to box office or their acting ability. Behind the scenes dealings that put a nail in the coffin of their career. 

whether this is the case of the actors being blacklisted due to politics or maybe some higher up who they blacklisted. Or because of some scandal that tainted their name. 

can you name any? any recent A-lister who seemingly had their career fade away without a conclustive explanation as to why?

"
7,"Any actors who unequivocally badmouthed their film prior to its release or during the promotion of it? How does that even work? Did they intently badmouth it? Did they never acknowledge any merits about the film itself? Did they mock the film or the crew behind it? did anything occur due to their negative reaction to the film (while promoting it)?

I'm quite curious how an A-lister like say Brad Pitt might have done with a film like Meet Joe Black or a Devil's Own. Does he just stay silent when promoting so as to not say anything negative about the experience?"
7,"Examples of roles in which an A-list leading man decided to appear in a supporting or ensemble role in a film. for which film and any reason why they did this? Like as a favor to the director or maybe they wanted to play a different type of role? For example, Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder. It was a supporting role. I gotta imagine a shock for anyone wondering why he'd take on such a role. Maybe he did it as a favor to Ben Stiller. He got a Golden Globe nod for it. 
Or say Leo DiCaprio in Django Unchained. Normally, he's the star and credited first in every film he's in; yet we see him here in a supporting role. He's probably only in 40 minutes of the film.
Or Brad Pitt in SNATCH. Again, a leading man taking part in a film with a supporting role. "
7,"Would we ever see a film with Denzel Washington and Tom Cruise? 2 huge stars who got their starts in the 80's and have been A-listers in every sense of the term. Cruise using his charisma and Denzel relying on his range. Has there ever been a project proposed that might have starred the two of them? Could we still see it happen someday in the future? Both appear to only be acting in star-driven action films now, so maybe that helps the likelihood of them being cast together?"
7,"How long until we start seeing Chinese blockbusters get wide releases in the US, UK and in Europe? There are more and more Chinese blockbusters being released abroad, but usually in select theaters. Perhaps this is due to lack of promotion or worries by studios that they won't perform. But when do you estimate that we might see a blockbuster of A-list Chinese stars get a big release in Hollywood? Like say 1000-2000 theaters. Would the film have to be in English? Could China propel a film like say Operation Red Sea or Wolf Warrior franchise to big success in the US or UK?

"
7,"Chadwick Boseman's new film ""17 Bridges"" due out in 4 months. Any news about it or a release date for a trailer? Chadwick Boseman's new film ""17 Bridges"" due out in 4 months. Any news about it or a release date for a trailer?


Boseman has a new film due out in July. It's his fist non-MCU role since 2018 (when he did both Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War). So, there's a lot of expectations and potential for this film. But does anyone know of when a movie trailer for it might be released? Seems kinda odd considering the involvement of Boseman and the Russo Brothers (as executive producers)?

"
7,"whatever happened to Colin Farrell? Back in 03/04 he was rising to be among the top A-list guys for his generations. Over the course of like 2 years, he was in roles in Minority Report with Tom Cruise, Phone Booth with Forest Whitaker, Hart's War with Bruce Willis, Daredevil with Ben Affleck, The Recruit with Al Pacino, SWAT with Samuel L. Jackson, Alexander with Angelina Jolie. Not too bad from a movie star perspective. I remember reading he was getting like 10 million for that Alexander film in 04. It seemed his career skyrocketed way too quickly. A good actor and charming, but somehow it faltered. He still gets roles like season 2 of True Detective or a supporting role in Widows. But what happened to him?

I wanna say his last big film was 2006's Miami Vice or maybe it was the 2012 Total Recall remake. "
7,"Luke Perry has a role in the new Quentin Tarantino film? That's pretty damn incredible. He's best known as being a teen idol from like 25/28 years ago. He's done some films that never went anywhere and has been on a few short-lived tv series. But it's quite likely one would say he's a washed up former star; yet somehow will be on screen opposite the likes of Brad Pitt and Leo DiCaprio. I'm curious how big of a role or what might critics think of his performance and of course, how QT decided to cast him. I sure hope he thanks his agent. "
7,"Foreign stars currently in Hollywood. How are they viewed in their native countries? Such as Rebel Wilson. She's been in a bunch of comedies over the last 7/8 years. Not a big star, but she seems to always get in some big films. How is she viewed back in Australia? Is she a big star there? Do Aussies care of her success/films here in Hollywood?

how about Alexander Skarsgard (of True Blood fame)? does he ever make time to do Swedish films? is he highly adored back in Sweden? Did they come out in droves to support him in The Legend of Tarzan?"
7,Why don't we see more foreign leading men/women in Hollywood films? For example. Most Hollywood films either have an American or British character in the lead role. When was the last time a big Hollywood film had an Aussie character as a the protagonist or a French character or even a Chinese character. It's quite forseeable that all would happen to be living in America. We have French/Australian/Chinese actors in Hollywood. But why don't we have foreign nationals as protagonists in big hollywood films?
7,"Delahunt in 2006's The Departed? Was he an undercover cop or was that just disinformation from the police to make Frank think the rat was already dead? Also, Delahunt informs Billy that he gave him the wrong address. The wording on his dialogue made it unclear as if he did that intentionally or not. But he does ask him why he didn't tell the other guys about Billy showing up to the right address on time despite being given the wrong one.

what do you guys think? why didn't he ""rat"" on Billy to Frank and the crew?"
7,"Whatever happened to Josh Hartnett? He was on Penny Dreadful for a few seasons a few years ago. He was in Black Hawk Down, Pearl Harbor 40 Days and 40 Nights, Hollywood Homicide. For about a few years 2001-04, he looked like he was on his way to being the next Ben Affleck or poor man's Tom Cruise. He followed those up with Lucky Number Slevin, The Black Dahlia, 30 Days of Night and then suddenly he was in a bunch of indies or films no one saw.

did he pick the wrong roles? was he losing roles to rivals like Gyllenhaal or Gosling? did he become disillusioned? I recall he kept turning down the Superman role. "
7,Hollywood films featuring South African actors/actresses or South African characters or taking place in South Africa? Hollywood films featuring South African actors/actresses or South African characters or taking place in South Africa. Can you think of any? I think of Lethal Weapon 2 which featured South African villains (Not sure if the actors were South African or not). I think of Sharlto Copley (of District 9) fame. There's also Charlize Theron whose probably among the most famous South Africans (globally). 
7,"Don Cheadle Don Cheadle. What do you think of him? Is he underrated? what's been his best film performance? Are you surprised he's in the MCU or that he's doing a tv series on Showtime?

He's worked with some pretty talented filmmakers in the past. One film in particular, The Guard, it never gets the love it deserves. Really spectacular small film.

what say you of Cheadle?"
7,Will we ever see Ryan Gosling and Jake Gyllenhaal star in a film together? Or would the universe explode? I'm imagining a film similar to a Heat where you put 2 of the best actors of their generation going head to head. Equivalent of say a Christian Bale and Joaquin Phoenix in a film together. what do you think? could there be an opportunity for such a film in the futures of Gyllenhaal and Gosling?
7,"Do you feel that Hollywood today is far more cosmopolitan/international than it was say during the Golden Age of Hollywood? Do we have actors/actresses from all over right now competing for top roles? Is it easier today for an actor like Christoper Waltz getting roles and becoming an A-lister than say 50-60 years ago? Are foreign filmmakers having an easier road to the top of the industry today or was it far more likely for them decades ago? 

do you feel we have more foreign leading men/women than we did 50/60/70 years ago?"
7,"Foreign special forces films So, can you think of any foreign films that feature their special forces? Like say any Australian films that feature the SASR or French films that feature their special forces or Danish films that depict the Jaegerkorpset.  I'm just curious how the director portrays their SOF units. Whether it's very similar to how a US action film might portray ours or maybe there's more layers/subtext to it. "
7,"Is Michael Fassbender a great actor or is he massively overrated? what are your thoughts? When I think of great actors of his generation (his competition), I think of the Bale/DiCaprio/Phoenix/Hardy/Gyllenhaal/Gosling. Now of course, I do feel that Fassbender is an incredible actor. But I don't sense that he's like among the best of his generation type of actor. Perhaps I'm wrong in this assessment as many critics seem to really HYPE him.

what do you think or feel?"
7,"The Black Panther sequel It's about 2 years away. Are you HYPED for it? Do you think it can live up to the hype or surpass the first or just be a decent sequel?

what do you want in the sequel? Do you want more of a focus on Wakanda and its neighbors? Would you prefer T'Challa and crew on another globetrotting adventure? Where to? Should we see cameos from other MCU characters?"
7,"Jake Gyllenhaal is the best actor under the age of 40 Come at me. Maybe Ryan Gosling gives him a run for his money. It's such a shame that he's only been nominated for an Oscar...just once. He easily deserved the Oscar (win) for Nightcrawler and a few nods for say Prisoners and Stronger. I really admire he keeps challenging himself especially in darker material. Heck, even his off-kilter roles (like Okja) are pretty damn intriguing to watch.

what do you say? am I very wrong? who'd you name as the best actor under the age of 40?"
7,"Scandinavian actors/actresses/filmmakers in Hollywood Would you say it's been quite easy for them? who are the top actors and filmmakers from the region?

I was surprised that Alexander Skarsgard isn't a bigger star. He was a star on True Blood and got the lead in that Tarzan reboot some years ago. Maybe he just prefers doing indie roles and avoiding high-profile films. But he should be a more well-known and demand actor IMO.

what about the rest? Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Mads Mikkelsen. Both come to mind when I think of Denmark. As well as the actor who was the villain on that Cinemax crime thriller; the name escapes me. "
7,"African actors in Hollywood Is Lupita Nyongo'o the first A-lister from Africa in the industry? Or if she's not an A-lister; she seemingly is quite close to breaking into that group wouldn't you say? 

Can you name other top African actors? I can think of Djimon Honsou. He seemed to be really busy in the 2000's. Mostly supporting roles, but in high profile films. Now he's seemingly paid to play cameo one-note roles in films like Guardians of the Galaxy and the last Tarzan film.

"
7,"Black leading men/women today The opportunities today; is it quite surprising considering how difficult it was for decades (for Black actors/actresses). It seems we can easily name maybe 10/15 Black leading men and equal amount of those on tv series. Whether in some Oscar dramas or action or comedy films, but it seems to be a lack of Black female actresses. Sure there's been Whoopi, Oprah, Halle Berry, Angela Bassett in the past with Viola Davis/Lupita Nyong'o and Taraji P. Henson today. But it sure feels like so many (Kerry Washington/Nia Long/Regina Hall) were on the edge of breaking into the A-list.

what do you think? the opportunities today? do we have colorblind casting today?"
7,"Someone give Steven Yeun some leading man roles He's got a growing fanbase. Has decent acting talent and comes off as very natural guy next door appeal. 
When was the last time we had an Asian-American male lead of a action star? I really feel he could be something BIGGER in the industry. Even if it's only the lead in indie films. 
 Like as a romantic lead on a drama. Whether his co-lead is Asian or White or Black. He could pull it off. Or the 1 honest cop in a corrupt police station. "
7,"Actors who continually appear in terrible or lowly rated films. Whether it's just that they do it for the $$$ or have terrible agents picking the wrong roles for them. Can they see the signs of a terrible film in the works? Actors/Actresses who happen to continually find themselves appearing in terrible or lowly rated films. Whether it's just that they do it for the $$$ or have terrible agents picking the wrong roles for them. Can they see the telltale signs of a terrible film in the works? 

which actors or actresses would you say fits the bill?
"
7,"What's Jake Gyllenhaal up to? He has the Velvet Buzzsaw film due out in a week or 2 on Netflix. And the villain role in the new Spider-Man film. But is he working on anything else? I remember he had signed on for like 6 films in the past 18 months (in addition to those he completed for release soon). Like The Division (film adaptation of the game), Rio (a film with Benedict Cumberbatch as well as some film where he plays a reporter fighting against ISIS.

so what's the man filming next?"
7,"Who are pretty famous A-list actors or directorswho are known for being terrible actors or directors 

I always see Kevin Costner being critiqued for being a terrible actor. But is that true you think? Or folks just like mocking him? Any other famous actors that you feel have huge/A-list careers despite being terrible actors or even Oscar/GG regularly nominated despite having limited range in their performances? 

And same for A-list directors who are just quite crappy filmmakers yet continue to be held in high regard or nominated for awards or remain popular in the industry?"
7,"Any films that depict European colonialism? Any films that depict European colonialism?

Particuarly set in the late 19th or early 20th century? Whether it's a war film or period piece with romantic elements. I was taking a Contemporary Africa class last semester and it got me interested in some cinema portraying the colonial/imperial system of the era. 

I'm quite curious if there are any in particular (especially if say French or Portuguese or German). Can you suggest any? "
7,"Any examples of A-list actors or unknown/rising actors who badmouthed a film they were in (while in the midst of promoting it)? Any examples of A-list actors or unknown/rising actors who badmouthed a film they were in (while in the midst of promoting it)?

I kinda wonder how some actors take the approach of promoting a project in which they're aware it is a stinker or that its destined to be a huge flop or potential Razzie winner. 
Usually, it seems actors might badmouth it mouths or years after its release. But how might they critique a film thats currently in release? any that you can recall?
"
7,"How do actors promote films in which they have a cameo role or they are uncredited or simply their appearance is part of the twist? Say for example, Matt Damon in Interstellar. Did he promote that film? Or was it all part of the surprise? what I wonder is how might a big star promote a film if their role is quite small? Like we see big named actors might have a small role in a film, but will be credited above the title to help sell the picture. Do the actors have to promote/""sell"" the project even if their role is quite small? any examples of actors doing this?"
7,"How does Hollywood compare to foreign films when it comes to films with female leads or having ethnic minorities in the lead? Say for example films from Japan or the Netherlands or Poland or New Zealand; do the films have solid three-dimensional roles for actresses or ethnic minorities? Or the roles they are offered; do they tend to be quite stereotypical in nature? Are there Turkish or Moroccoan-Dutch actors getting good acting opportunities? Are Japanese actresses finding capable acting roles?

how does Hollywood compare today in its efforts to diversify its roles for actors/actresses today?"
7,"Jake Gyllenhaal. Your thoughts The star of Donnie Darko/Brokeback Mountain/Nightcrawler.

what's been his best performance in your opinion? Is he among the best actors of his generation? Is he overrated or underrated? Is it a travesty that he only has 1 Oscar nomination or just bad luck? Was he snubbed an Oscar nod for Nightcrawler? Is there a Classic actor or a leading man over the last few decades that you feel Gyllenhaal's acting style or career personifies?"
7,Better Actor? Joaquin Phoenix or Christian Bale or Leo DiCaprio? which is the best actor of those 3? All 3 of them born in 1974 and were child actors. All 3 have multiple Oscar nominations with Bale and DiCaprio having won. which has the best filmography? which has the most range? who's given the best film performance? Of those 3; do you feel confident in saying they are the best male actors of their generation? do you feel the likes of Tom Hardy or Michael Fassbender or Ryan Gosling or Jake Gyllenhaal are on their level? 
7,"Interracial relationships in Hollywood films do you feel Hollywood has various depictions of interracial relationships today or is it still lacking? Is it always Black male/white female or white male and various ethnicities for his female love interest. what baout homosexual interracial relationships?

are the relationships portrayed evenhandedly or simply as a fact of life? how are interracial relationships in foreign cinema? 

why haven't we seen the likes of a Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt with a non-love interest (other than foreign based films where they hook up with a local woman)? what of their equivalent matinee idols today like a Channing Tatum or Ryan Gosling? are they more likely to see an interrracial relationship in film today than say the likes of Cruise or Pitt back in the day?"
7,"Actors who are far better directors than they are actors Actors who are more talented behind the screen than in front of the screen. I was thinking Emilio Estevez (of Breakfast Club and Young Guns) fame. He has done some truly atrocious films like Maximum Overdrive and Freejack and several more. But he's done some really good work behind the camera like in The War At Home, Bobby, The Way and The Public. He's really seem to have established himself in the past decade or so.

any other actors you feel that are immensely talented as directors. "
7,"Actor whose worked with the most talented/diverse set of filmmakers I'd nominate Tom Cruise. He's worked with Spielberg, Michael Mann, Scorcese, Ridley Scott, Stanley Kubrick, Oliver Stone. Those are some heavyweights in the industry. He's also worked with some talents such as John Woo, Paul Thomas Anderson, Edward Zwick, Barry Levinson and Camerone Crowe.

The only other actor that comes close (IMO) is Leo DiCaprio. James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, Scorcese, Woody Allen, Danny Boyle, Ridley Scott, Sam Mendes, Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino, Clint Eastwood, Baz Luhrmann.

what do you think?

I feel Cruise should have worked with Nolan or Tarantino by now. "
7,"The undertones in TOP GUN So, it's a classic 80's film. A popcorn film that is Legendary. But does the mainstream public ever consider the homoerotic undertones in the film? Did Joe and Jill not realize anything when they brought their families to check the film out in summer of '86? It's quite funny to me. I saw it as a kid and loved it. I watch the film again as an adult and start seeing cracks in the facade. I'm quite curious if anyone back (at the time of the premiere) was critical of the themes of the film or the undertones. what do you think? does anyone ever discuss the homosexual tone of TG?"
7,"Films where the protagonist appears (not at the very start of the film, but much later) Can you list a film or films where the main character shows up later into the film than in the opening few scenes

whether it's the 5th minute they appear or perhaps 15 minutes into the film; can you think of such a film where the protagonist doesn't appear at the very start of the film or in the opening scenes?

do you believe it adds to the film or does it detract when the main character isn't on screen at the start of a film?"
7,"Why is it so difficult to make a contemporary war film into something both critics and audiences might love? Is it because we have a 24/7 newsfeed so we're often apathetic to battles or war heroes half a world away? Do modern audiences not want to explore the black/white/grey of current wars we are involved in?
Is it that top directors and actors tend to avoid such films because it may be controversial or potentially divisive? Is it just a 2hr film of troops hunting terrorists not fun for the audience? Why do you think the last contemporary war film (Black Hawk Down) was only a partial hit and all those after have flopped? Or do the characters need to be more morally ambiguous and potentially spies or analysts or interrogators (given the nature of recent wars)?"
7,"Actors who drastically reduced their salary demands or took scale for a certain film project 
Actors who drastically reduced their salary demands or took scale for a particular film they were working on?

Can you think of any films where an actor was paid far less than normally paid? Like maybe they did it to do the director a favor or perhaps they were just truly excited to work with a certain actor or director. Maybe they wanted to do this as a ""passion project"".

I remember that film, ""Full Frontal"" directed by Steven Soderbergh. I believe Julia Roberts worked for scale on that."
7,"Are there more and more films featuring scenes of characters speaking a foreign language but with no subtitles? I get that it's intent to be disorienting or to be dramatic to some degree; but are there more and more of these being released. I do often wonder if the desired intent of the director is felt by the audience or if they are in complaints that for some scenes they can't follow what's going on.

I always thought it's interesting how US doesn't dub foreign films but the Germans, Italians, French and Spanish still do. "
7,"Why are so many fantasy films feature British characters? Is there a reason? Is it just that fantasy films pretty much seem to gel well with British characters and their accents to the ears of mainstream audiences?
I can understand those films based on fantasy novels written decades ago. But for today. It seems every large budget fantasy film with a protagonist of age 8-13 happens to be British. I'd love to have one that featured a Canadian (just as a change of pace) or perhaps a an Australian. "
7,"Actors who make multiple films in a year or 2 versus actors who make only a few films every few years I think of Samuel L. Jackson who is notorious for appearing in so many films. I gotta wager he's done at least 3 films a year for 15 years plus. Whether it's lead roles or supporting. And then I think of someone like Jude Law. I think he had like 6 films within a 12-18 month period. Chris Rock made fun of that at the 05 Oscars. And what of Dicaprio? He seemingly makes one film a year and then makes another two years after. He's first film since The Revenant will be after 4 years.

"
7,"Are there any American actors or characters in foreign films? So, we see tons of Brits and British characters in British films these days. It's kinda unusual for me if at least 1 character (or actor on a popular series) isn't played by a British actor. It makes sense as it's perfectly normal for someone from London or Sheffield to move to the US (if it's the character). Or simply British actors can easily get roles in Hollywood. 

 But it got me wondering, are there any Australian or British or French or Indian films that feature American characters or American actors/actresses on them?"
7,"British actors who are horrendous at American accents British actors who are horrendous at American accents 

It's usually said that British actors are experts at doing American accents, but what about those who are poor or simply suck at doing them? Can you think of any? For every Hugh Laurie, there must be someone's American accent that is quite embarrassingly abysmal right?"
7,"Why don't we get more foreign films from say Canada/Australia/NZ/Ireland/South Africa at our theaters? Their films are in English. Mostly you can't tell the difference between a Canadian or US film. Probably only revealing point is US films tend to have a larger budget.

And why don't we get more cinema from Australia? We've maybe a dozen Australian A-listers in the past decade or 2. And quite a few famous directors. Isn't Hollywood yearning to debut their films for American audiences?

And what about South Africa? Occasionally, they have a film every few years thats competing for recognition at this or that film festival. One would think we might see a few more films coming from there over here. "
7,"Any major Hollywood films that happen to take place in Canada or feature a Canadian protagonist? Can you think of any? I'm watching Scott Pilgrim vs the World and I honestly believe this is the only film (with a blockbuster budget) to feature a cast of Canadian characters that's actually set (and filmed) in Canada.

Why don't more American films (or even series) feature Canadian lead characters in their story/plots?"
7,"European war films. Any that you can recommend? I remember asking a friend about this, but it seems most French or Dutch or Belgian films that portray the Second World War; it's pretty much dramatic Oscar bait type films. Are there any Saving Private Ryan or Dunkirk-type films from those nations?

And what about the contemporary world? Like films set in UN peacekeeping missions or in Afghanistan. I had seen a French film on its special forces in Pakistan as well as a Danish war film set in Afghanistan.

any others?"
7,"Foreign films in released in the US today. Are modern audiences likely to see more foreign films today versus say 50-60 years ago? Are foreign films just released at arthouses or select theaters (if they're going wide-released)?

what's the reasoning for why we don't have so many foreign films? There's always some British films that do quite well with a US release. I remember Hot Fuzz being a hit in US theaters (despite not being in all that many). But why don't we see many Australian or New Zealander films or Irish films released in the US?

In the coming decades, do you anticipate larger Chinese/Indian films being released in the US? Whether it's big budget action or Oscar type films?"
7,"Which actors have done the worst accents in a film? Any that you can name? I always heard Tom Cruise got a lot of flak for the Irish accent he had in ""Far and Away"". Same as Halle Berry playing Storm in the X-Men films. Not really sure what she was going for with that accent.I kinda feel bad for the actors though since they at least tried to do the accent and it went horrible awry rather than those (Kevin Costner) who didn't even try in say Robin Hood.

any actors/actresses you can think of?"
7,"Actors careers who seemingly died after having won an Oscar anyone whose career seemingly took a massive downturn immediately after or within a few years post-Oscar win. I can think of Cuba Gooding Jr. who won an Oscar for Jerry Maguire in '97. Though he had at least half a dozen leading roles over the next few years. But all flops and the roles were worse and worse. Maybe it's all due to his agent or simply Cuba signing on just to get some $$$

or maybe it's just the fact he was never a big star before the Oscar win and the win itself didn't do much to his career.

what do you think? Is it an Oscar curse?"
7,"When a film is portraying a story set in a foreign country with a different language.. should the film feature the actors speaking with a foreign accent or just keep with an American or British accent. For example like in Valkyrie. It's set in WW2 Germany. The main characters are all speaking British accents or American accent (in the case of Tom Cruise's character). There's also The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Set in Sweden but everyone has a British accent. 

Is it a great choice for them to try and do the local accent (or would that just be made for mockery)? 

In the Hunt for Red October, wasn't there the famous scene in the film where they go from speaking in Russian with subtitles to suddenly speaking in English. 

what's the best way for a Hollywood film to portray a story in a foreign language/country?"
7,"Hollywood Actors who had roles in foreign films? 

any that you can think of? I remember reading something once that Will Smith had always wanted to do a Bollywood film. That'd be a great sight to see someday. Was it actors that spoke a foreign language or simply interested in doing something outside of the typical Hollywood production?

It'd have been quite interesting to see the likes of a Kevin Costner or Mel Gibson or Harrison Ford (at their peak) doing a role in a foreign film, whether it be a foreign language role or not. "
7,"Actors who refused to do accents while playing foreign characters Kevin Costner is most famous for this. Playing Robin Hood with his American accent. But there are others right? I'm watching Lost Command with Anthony Quinn. He's playing a French Army colonel in Indochina and he speaks with an American accent. 

any films that you can name where an actor just refuses to do ""an accent"" for the film? any reason for behind that; whether they just are not good at doing the accent or something more?"
7,"Impressions of ""The Thing"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" today versus when they first debuted decades ago anyone caught those films in the theater or on home video initially? I'm curious how well received they were back then. Like I know that The Thing flopped. But why was that exactly? And why didn't Dawn of the Dead perform far better? 

Has the perception of the films changed greatly in the past few decades. They're arguably among the best horror films of all time. Surely in the top 20, right? what do you think?"
7,Lupita Nyong'o. Is she a Star? Among the most famous Black actresses right now. But is she up there with Viola Davis and Taraji P. Henson. Is she A-list? I would say that Black Panther's success has def boosted her career. She's seemingly got a multitude of films in the pipeline. The remake of a John Woo film; the proposed multinational female spy film as well as the African story of female warriors with Viola Davis. Do you think her star will continue to rise? Or that she hasn't done much in the past 4.5 years since her Oscar win? 
7,"Jake Gyllenhaal or Ryan Gosling? For me, the 2 best male actors born in the 1980's. 

Which is the better actor? who gave the best performance? who takes more risks in film projects? which between the 2 has the best filmography? which has a better box office potential? 

do you feel these 2 are among the top male actors of their generation? Are you hoping for a collaboration between these 2 someday?"
7,"DON CHEADLE APPRECIATION 
Show some LOVE!!! Ocean's trilogy! Rosewood! MCU! Hotel Rwanda! Crash! Traitor! House of Lies!

what's his best performance? why is he seemingly underrated?

It wasn't too long ago that he was arguably an A-lister. He was doing so many films. Like a character actor, but actually in the lead role. I was shocked when he did House of Lies and also got into the superhero business.

I'm hoping he gets a larger role in the next Avengers film and he goes back to doing some indie roles."
7,"Actors/Actresses who turned down film major film roles Maybe they turned it down because there was scheduling conflicts or because they didn't agree with the character or issues with the director. Any that you can think of?

Sarah Michelle Gellar was cast in Gangs of New York, but had scheduling conflicts with Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Once she was out, supposedly Scorcese wanted Sarah Polley, but she didn't want to do a big studio films. Cameron Diaz was later cast.

I kinda wish SMG was able to make it work. I don't get Diaz's being nominated for a Golden Globe in the film. Felt that someone younger might have fit the role better. "
7,"Black leading ladies in Hollywood How many are you aware of; whether today or in the past?'

Off the top of my head currently I can name Viola Davis, Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer... though Spencer seems to always nab supporting roles that net her award buzz. Henson has done like half a dozen films since she started Empire. Davis is always nominated for this or that so she's seemingly in a great place in the industry.

It seems so long ago when the likes of Halle Berry or Angela Bassett were the only arguably A-list Black actresses out there. though I think Berry (at her peak) was commanding salaries equivalent of Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore.

It def seems that nowadays there's more opportunity for Black actresses, though seemingly in the comedic genre. Tiffany Haddish seems to be gelling well there. And Queen Latifah had quite a few films back in the 2000's. Along with Jada Pinkett Smith.

whatever happened to Paula Patton? She seemed Destined to break out into some leading lady roles but it never quite worked out for her? I guess something similar to Zoe Kravitz. She's in so many films, but never as a star. "
7,"What's the next Jake Gyllenhaal film? I see that he's got a villain role in the Spidey sequel and a Netflix film where he teams up again with Dan Gilroy. But what's next? Over the past year he's been linked to the video game adaptation of the Division, some spy thriller set in Austria, a film where he stars opposite Benedict Cumberbatch, a film about anarchists who go off and fight ISIS with the Kurds.

All sound like wonderful films. I hope he def makes them all."
7,"Where are the big budget British action films? Or epic war movies set in the contemporary age? The British have a rich history of conflicts and wars going back several centuries. So why don't we see these on screen? If there's something revolving the Middle Ages, it's a tv series. Is it simply because it's cheaper or just not interesting enough to get a movie star willing to star in such a project? And why don't see see any action films centering around British soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan? One would have imagined there'd be enough material for an SAS film or one about the Royal Marine Commandos?

Is it because the wars over the past 15 years have been pretty controversial and such a film wouldn't succeed in the UK box office today? Does the James Bond franchise make a war film or special forces type movies pointless?"
7,"Is Tom Cruise a great actor? Or is he just a decent actor?  Is her overrated or underrated? 



I've a few friends who confuse being a movie star with being a great actor. I've a few others who dump on Cruise mostly for being in so many action films or not taking enough daring roles. But what would you say? what's his best film performance (s)?

For me it has to be Born on the Fourth of July. But Magnolia and Interview with a Vampire come real close. And he's insanely good in Risky Business as well as something like Collaterral.

I wonder if his box office success just made it easy for most film snobs to write him off as too much of a popcorn film actor."
7,"Films in which you are shocked or surprised by the budget Whether it's that the film was made far less than you imagined or that it was made for a far more expensive budget than you could have ever thought possible. I was reading the new Netflix film ""Outlaw King"" with Chris Pine had a budget of $120 million. I'd have guessed it was 30 million maximum.

can you name some others? "
7,"Jake Gyllenhaal or Ryan Gosling? whose the better actor? which has the most range? whose given the best performance? whose given the worst performance? which has the best filmography?

I'd say Jake's best role was Nightcrawler with roles like Prisoners/Jarhead/Brokeback Mountain/Donnie Darko coming close in his top 5.

Ryan's best were Half Nelson with Lars and The Real Girl/The Place Beyond The Pines/Drive/First Man in his top 5. 
"
7,Some really terrible/atrocious acting or films by really talented actors Any films that you can name in which a truly talented actor appeared in something so atrocious or abysmal that it almost shames the actor? What's the worst or most terrible performance by a talented actor? Was the actor over-acting? Was the blame on the script or the director? Was it early on in their career or did the actor just not give a damn about the film itself?
7,"Christian Bale?Leo DiCaprio? Joaquin Phoenix? Matt Damon?Tom Hardy? Michael Fassbender? Jake Gyllenhaal? Ryan Gosling? Gyllenhaal?Gosling?Phoenix?DiCaprio?Hardy?Fassbender? (self.movies)

Of those 8 who would you rate as the best actor of their generation? the Generation being of actors born in the 1970's and 80's? Who has shown the greatest range? Who has made the best film between the 6? Are any of the 6 seemingly ""over-hyped"" or are they really as good/great as been mentioned before? Has any of them done some really terrible and atrocious acting or movies? "
7,"Leading actors/actresses who are rarely in a supporting role You know, the type of big stars that are always in a leading role. They rarely do a cameo in a film or a supporting role. Heck, they almost never do an ensemble film. I remember seeing Tom Cruise in both Magnolia and Tropic Thunder. I was quite surprised to see him take an ensemble film and a supporting role in the later. Quite interesting that he was nominated for Golden Globes for both with the former netting him an Oscar nod.

any big star actors that are always doing lead roles for this or that reason? "
7,"How many foreign films are released in the USA? Do they only get select showings? Is that simply for awards consideration? Do you feel the industry should show some favor to say the cinemas of a South Africa or Taiwan or Portugal and run a popular film or theirs here? To see if there might be an audience for it? 

Considering how many British films do get released here, why don't we see any Canadian or Australian films do the same? They're in English (and perhaps they star some Hollywood-based stars) so it'd drive some fan interest.

And do you ever see Indian or Chinese films growing in popularity here? Maybe even being discussed as a major release on this or that weekend?"
7,Why don't we dub films in the US? It's been done in Germany/France/Italy/Spain for decades and its quite popular (especially in Germany). There's always the stereotype that Americans hate reading subtitles; and yet I can not think of any foreign films that were dubbed upon release here in the US? why do you think that is? Is it simply that we don't get enough foreign films as is so it makes little difference if it's sub-titled or dubbed? 
7,"Foreign war films set in the modern era Any films that you've seen and enjoyed? There's quite a few Danish war films of late. Or at least films that deal with Iraq/Afghanistan and the war on terror. I believe Bodre and A War are the titles. There was a Polish film I watched based on some battle in Iraq over a decade ago. As well as a Spanish film about a rescue and recover. It came out last year. Quite interesting to see these films. I also saw a French film on a special forces unit trying to rescue a kidnapped journalist. Dianne Kruger starred in that film.

what do you think about foreign war films; specifically those set in recent wars or conflict zones? Are they well done? "
7,"whatever happened to John Cusack? it seems a lifetime ago where he was a semi-big star. Feels like for the past decade he's just done ridiculous direct-to-video films. In fact, the only movie of his (that went to theater this decade) has to be Hot Tub Time Machine. what happened? did he just give up? why did he go and try to emulate Nicolas Cage's career? I'm sure Cusack could have picked up some supporting roles in big films. "
8,"TinTin sequels would be great I Love the TinTin comics as well as the early 90s animated TV show & the motion capture adaptation of 2011 is absolutely wonderful. 

Reminds me very much of its source material & in combination with Spielbergian suspense extremely much of something like Indiana Jones. I generally think Spielberg is better at making adventure thrills than at political dramas. 

It‘s just a compelling adventure with a heart, charme and a working sense of humour, great storytelling, great voice acting and a unique visual flair. 

The movie wasnt the biggest smash hit but it did nearly triple its 130 mil budget and was very well received. I‘m genuinely surprised there are no sequels. 

I‘d love some more TinTin stories in this vein, as there are definitely enough to do!"
8,"I think that 300: Rise of an Empire isn‘t actually that bad. 

Snyders 300 (2006) is an absolutely great movie. In the vein of visual coherence & unflinching pathos, homoerotic CGI sixpacks and all the other gory perversions & fetishes of Zack. It‘s one of the most entertaining action movies of the century in my opinion.

It‘s 8 year after follow-up 300: Rise of an Empire is nowhere near as strong, but I actually think it‘s not that bad of a movie its made out to be. 
The main complaint I‘ve heard about it is that it‘s inaccurate history & tells its story too one sided. 

**A.)** this is a freakin comic book movie thats (loosely) based on real history/mythology. It‘s still a COMIC BOOK movie, hence the visual flair. 
**B.)** all historical or not so historical movies portray the events more or less one sided. We witness the story out of perspective of the Greeks, obviously the Greeks are then the good guys and the Persians comic book villains. An english person can watch Braveheart and not be insulted that the English are the bad guys. A german person can watch Inglorious Basterds, or take any WW1/2 film and not be insulted that the Germans are always the bad guys. These are movies, not documentaries. 

I feel like, even if it doesnt have the pathos of the first one, it still contains lots of engaging action and fight sequences. 
It definitely earns its R-rating, and even a very hard R. It‘s full of gore and blood and heads getting sliced and throats getting cut and because of the ship action it also feels different than the original. 

Yes, there are structural problems, you might say its constant violence seems bland & some of it looks a bit too cartoon-ish; even Eva Green, while being certainly fun, intimidating & seductive, does feel a bit.. „bloated“ (?). 
But I‘ll honestly re watch & take it over a generic superhero movie any time. While this was directed by Noam Durro (though co-produced & co-written by Zack), I hope Snyder does another one of these as there are enough Greek stories to tell."
8,"The Lego Batman Movie (2017) is a total blast. That's really how you do a self aware superhero movie.  
Full of funny references on its roots and different stages its character went through in comics or major movie franchises, but still dissecting the protagonists true essence and not giving up themes in order to appear more self aware.  
The latter one is missing in Deadpool movies as they basically are 2 hour long movies that constantly remind you how stupid they are.  
This one, while being creative and innovative in its scope and action, does get its characters right (with big thanks to the voice acting) and does have themes and logical arcs throughout.  
The first hour is literally exhilarating and even if it seems contemporary busy in the second half, I genuinely think this is a blast."

It is a remake or at least based on a French movie, also titled [Point Blank](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1545759/?ref_=nv_sr_3?ref_=nv_sr_3).

It was released today on Netflix. What are your thoughts on it?"
8,"Watching the Coen Brothers Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) feels like being trapped in a loop of hopelessness It does contain some of the Coen‘s trademark witty dialogue, for instance Carey Mulligan‘s condom rant is absolutely hilarious, but it‘s less quirkier and way less apparent than in most of their films. 

Inside Llewyn Davis is shot with a very deep colour palette making the whole much colder & emulating the stressful predicament of Llewyn. It‘s dark & shot with extreme precision and honestly such a visually beautiful film ( despite actually not having long time Coen collaborator Rodger Deakins as cinematographer - Bruno Delbonnel (also in Buster Scruggs)).

It‘s a story about a struggling musician, who a.) struggles in his profession but also b.) desperately searches meaning in life and can‘t seem to find any purpose. The Coen‘s existentialism is a trademark, but their protagonist is rarely as egoistic & distant as Llewyn, he‘s basically the polar opposite of The Dude, the Coen‘s most iconic character. 

It‘s tone is so melancholic that even if you should definitely hate the titular character, you can‘t but feel sorry for him. How he goes from one disappointment to another one. How he tries to chase & find cats. How he drags himself from one couch to another. It‘s truthful in a way but also so unsatisfying and makes you feel uncomfortable. 

What is your take on it?"
8,"Zhang Yimou‘s Hero (2002) is one of the most hauntingly beautiful movies I have ever seen It‘s been a few hours since I finished it and I‘m still thinking about it. This movie just left such a huge impression on me and it‘s extremely tough to put that into words.

In ancient China, before the reign of the first emperor, warring factions throughout the Six Kingdoms plot to assassinate the most powerful ruler, Qin. When a minor official defeats Qin's three principal enemies, he is summoned to the palace to tell Qin the story of his surprising victory. Through flashbacks & fight sequences the story unravels and we see different perspectives on how it went down.

Let me start by saying that I do find this to be one of the most gorgeous movies ever. I know that there are a lot of visually appealing movies, some of which I‘d describe with the phrase „every frame a painting“ (some latest examples are Kurzel‘s Macbeth or Villeneuves BR49) but this honestly has to be somewhere on the top.

It‘s such a perfect blend of mythological/fantastical elements, all of which are perfectly integrated in its more of less historical setting, breathtaking fight sequences, the relentless moral themes sprinkled throughout every inch of the movie & the tragedy of it‘s characters, brilliantly conveyed by a terrific cast of Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung & Daoming Chen. 

Roger Ebert once said that movies are empathy machines & if that is, Hero overwhelmed me. Kind of in a way that really few movies do (of the tip of my tongue I‘d say The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Andrew Dominik, 2007). It‘s so immense in scope but also so intimate in its tragedy. It‘s a breathtaking tale about a man‘s & an empire‘s destiny & way to peace. 

What‘s your take on it?"
8,"How'd you rank all the Mad Max movies & what are your general thoughts on them? Over the last couple of days I (re) watched the 4 Mad Max movies and here is how I'd rank them w/ some thoughts.

&#x200B;

4. Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome (1985) **6/10**  
It's not necessarily a bad movie. Indeed it has some memorable world building and introduces interesting characters to the universe (Master Blaster is cool, and Tina Turner must have had fun with it), but it's also way too cartoonish and over the top at times, lacking the ""nightmarish"" atmosphere / replacing it with camp. It does start & end good, but it's middle section really drags.

&#x200B;

3. Mad Max (1979) **8/10**  
This is so much more of a tragedy than a post apocalyptic action movie its sequels went on to be. It's filmed on such a low budget but it's action still feels convincing and minimalistic, making it very intimate in scope and its dramatic story about a town slowly being degenerated and terrorized by a motorcycle gang. It's a bare knuckle extravaganza through a half dead, yet still half alive desert. Toecutter is one of the most despicable movie villains of the 70s.

&#x200B;

2. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981) **9/10**  
40 years ago and it's influence on the action genre & especially post apocalyptic action is terrific. It's bold, captivating and exhilarating filmmaking. A juvenile, kinetic and high impact movie that never loses scope or focus and slowly evolves into a Walpurgisnacht like terror. Gibson gives the best performance out of all Mad Max films, the balance of someone haunted & deeply conflicted. The Humungous looks like a BDSM character, but he's honestly intimidating.

&#x200B;

1 Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) **10/10**  
It left me no other choice. Fury Road isn't only my favorite Mad Max movie, it's also one of the greatest action movies ever made (I currently have T2 at that spot, but who knows?). It's a movie of opposites, a pair that not only follow an external process, but are already intertwined as opposites. It's loud and louder but it doesn't numb. It's a picture perfect, ambitious and hypnotizing composition of sound, image and edit. There's still an ingenious amount of world building and new characters (it could easily be called: Furios Fury Road), but it's also referencing a lot of shots and sequences from the original trilogy. A 4th movie in an action franchise surely has never been this great.

&#x200B;

What about you? What are your thoughts on the MadMax films and how would you rank them?"
8,"In honor of Fathers Day, what is your favorite dad-child relationship in movies? For me, it's gotta be Finding Nemo. 

It's one of the few stories I actually remember where the father is the hero and has to save his son.

And in general, Finding Nemo is such a beautiful film, packed with delightfully funny characters, visually stunning animation, a clever script and honest heart & charm.

What is your favorite ""dad"" movie, or your favorite dad/child relationship in movies?"
8,"Even though it is part comedy and plays out satisfying, the more I think about it, Truman Show is one of the most terrifying movies I have ever watched. Like, seriously, imagine if it wasn't a comedy or rated PG, or hadn't got Jim Carrey as a lead. It would have basically been Westworld.

I know it's wonderfully subversive and I love the satirical outlook on celebrity obsession and the media itself but the concept of a real life Truman Show deconstructs the basic foundation of human life. 

Even his own mother is god damn fake and her only real part of the ""storyline"" is to make him get babies so that he's indefinitely trapped in this world. 

Imagine Truman Show being R-Rated, where you have cameras all around every where you go. Like, we would have seen him masturbate or shit like that.

The more I think about it the more fucked up and terrifying it does appear to me.

What about you?"
8,"Casino Royale (2006) is a thematically faithful adaptation of Flemings influential novel, a masterpiece and the greatest James Bond movie ever made. Here is a comparison I made between the movie/novel & my thoughts on both of them. Over the last week I read Ian Flemings first James Bond novel Casino Royale for the first time and later re watched the movie. Here are some thoughts on both, including a comparison of similarities, differences and the over all enjoyment I get out of both of these pieces.

**Technical aspects:**

Casino Royale (novel, 1953), written by Ian Fleming [27 short chapters, around 250 pages, depending on edition\]

[Casino Royale](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381061/) (movie, 2006), directed by Martin Campbell \[144 minute runtime\]

Before diving into further comparisons, there are **two** obvious, but also **significant differences** between the movie and the novel. The first being the **time it is set in**, both are contemporary to their release date. Meaning the novel is set in the Cold War whereas the movie is set in the 21 century. Because of the resulting differences in international relations historically speaking, you could transfer it (but you don't have to) to the second difference. Flemings novel is a **political espionage thriller**, whereas Campbells movie re-boot is basically an **action movie**.

\----------

**Structure:**

The over all **plot of the movie is very similar**, nearly identical to its source material.

James Bond, a fresh 00, is set in a high stakes Poker game against Le Chiffre, a desperate (&amp; near bankrupt) banker working for terrorist organizations. Bonds allies are Mathis, Felix Leiter &amp; Vesper Lynd. Bond wins the money, Vesper &amp; him get captured, following the torture, Le Chiffre being interrupted/killed by a member of a mysterious organization. After Bond &amp; Vesper seek a happy life, the latter is confronted with her ""real"" identity/past &amp; kills herself, leaving Bond emotionally broken &amp; eventually cold.

As said in my first paragraph, Flemings novel isn't an ""action"" novel. There is an early assassination/botched bomb attempt in the early chapters (similar to the airport sequence) but it's nowhere near as action heavy as the movie, which follows *parkour chases*, *knife fights &amp; bus/plane explosions, stairway fights &amp; the closing crumbling house set piece.*

Narratively Bond **meets his allies way earlier,** in the movie Vesper &amp; Mathis are introduced around an hour in, whereas in the novel already in the first few chapters, Felix Leiter is introduced very late in the movie and only after Bond is struggling in the Poker game. The whole Dimitrious, Ellipse stuff isn't in the novel.

\----------

**Main characters:**

**- James Bond:**

Bonds portrayal is very close to the novel. He's described as a very tough man, perfectly shown by Craigs physical appearance, his hard &amp; masculine face &amp; the early corporal fight scenes &amp; chases. His attitude fits the source material. Bond is smart &amp; charming, but he can switch of in any moment to being a ruthless killer.

**- Vesper Lynd:**

A big part of Vespers character in the novel is her beauty. There are long passages describing everything about her body &amp; face. She certainly is beautiful in the movie, played by the gorgeous Eva Green. Yet in the movie she comes across as much more independent &amp; aware. She's smart in the novel, but much more worthy in a psychological duel with Bond in the movie. In both the movie &amp; novel she is a double agent, who got blackmailed &amp; had to take this identity in order to save her boyfriend, but then fell in love with James.

**- Le Chiffre:**

Le Chiffre, in both movie &amp; novel is a scary fucking dude. There still is something a bit charming about Mikkelsen presence though. He's described as considerably ugly in the novel, and basically as the epitome of evil. In the movie he comes across as more ""human"", desperation etc (make no mistake he's a vicious bastard, but he's not the devil).

**- M:**

The obvious difference is the gender swap in M. In the novel, Bond respects &amp; in some way even fears M. The Bond/M relationship of Flemings books never really translated onto the bigger screen (it's tough to find someone intimidating against the charisma of Connery to be fair) so the change is an interesting touch. While he certainly respects Judi Denchs M, there is more slick and clever dialogue coming out of the conversations.

\----------

**The Poker Game:**

The Poker game in the novel, as basically all of it, is set in **France**, whereas the movie jumps around Madagascar, the Bahamas, Venice &amp; **Montenegro**, the latter being the setting of the poker game.

Also, in the novel they play Baccarat, which was very popular at that time, in the movie they play Texas Hold 'Em, which (surprise) was popular in that time. The game itself is similar structured, back and forth until Le Chiffre wins a big one and Bond is in huge desperation but comes back in the last round winning all of it (with the help of Felix Leiters money).

In both movie &amp; novel, Le Chiffre tries to prevent/""attack"" Bond during the last hand. In the movie he gets poisoned, which nearly causes him to pass out. In the novel, he is directly physically threatened by a bodyguard of the Le Chiffre with a gun under the table/chair.

\--------

**Remarkable similarities:**

\- Practically the entire torture scene is directly taken out of the source material. Bond gets stripped naked and tied up to a chair, then punched to the balls multiple times until the near pass out. Only difference is that in the movie Le Chiffre uses a rope, in the novel it is a carpet beater.

\- Some dialogue &amp; lines are extracted out of Flemings novel. Such as the Vesper/Martini order.

&gt;*Three measures of Gordons, one of* *vodka, half a measure of* *Kina Lillet.* *Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel. Got it?*

Or the iconic line.

&gt;The bitch is dead.

\---------

**Other differences:**

\- The whole Mathis alleged double cross plot point only appears in the movie.

\- Vespers double cross, signaled by her seeing the man with the eye patch is left to a good bye letter in the novel that Bond reads after she'd poisoned herself. In the movie, she gives the man with the eye patch the money briefcase and after the shoot out in Venice, she traps herself in the elevator and drowns in the crumbling house.

\- In the books, the mysterious organization is SMERSH, a russian anti spy organization. In CR it is still unnamed, though in the later Craig films revealed to be SPECTRE.

\- The book ends very depressing as her betrayal letter is the last thing. The movie ends on a higher note with Bond capturing Mr White &amp; ending the movie in his iconic introduction lines.

\---------

I have certainly missed a ton of differences of both, but I feel like I have done enough to highlight most of them. Here are some of my personal **thoughts:**

**The novel:**

I had a ton of fun reading it for the first time. It's certainly colder &amp; much more serious than a lot of James Bond movies but I liked that it felt more grounded and had espionage instead of thrills. There is a lot of political subtext added by Ian Fleming that reflects on the cold war and on spy agents themselves. It also features some great insight on the Poker game as Bonds mind is on full display with mathematical &amp; stochastically relevant information throughout every hand. I think it ends on a very depressing and sad note, setting the tone for the character to come.

**The movie:**

I have always considered Casino Royale to be **one of my favorite movies of all time.** I think it's head and shoulders above every other James Bond film and every time I watch it I discover new things I love about it. The way the movie starts, with the cold blooded double-O earning in a noir fashion, then goes over to the gorgeous credit sequence with so much ingenuity sprinkled across it, is amazing. I'm also amazed by the **action** the movie has. The Parkour chase has some terrific stunt work &amp; innovation. Or the airplane sequence is packed with enormous tension and suspense. Or the closing Venice shoot out is packed with bad ass moments by Bond. A lot of my love for the movie also comes from the **cast.** It does contain my a.) favorite Felix Leiter (played by Jeffrey Wright), b.) favorite Bond girl (Vesper Lynd by Eva Green), c.) the best M (played by Judi Dench) and one of my favorite Bond villains (played by Mads Mikkelsen, who is as terrific as ever). **Martin Campbell** has rock solid directing, focussing on the great stuff of the source material and just like in *GoldenEye* knowing how to introduce a new Bond &amp; a new way of Bond into the franchise. **Daniel Craig** is relentlessly amazing. He has the charms, he definitely has the looks, he is believable in the kills, he has a soul, he has a heart, he has emotion. Only Connery is better. The movie also looks gorgeous. Not only its vast settings of exotic locations, beautiful women, high class restaurants, cafes or hotels, pieces of clothing and so on, but also its sharp image and cinematography, by Phil Meheux is astounding. Despite being literally written by three people it also contains some ingenious dialogue. Especially the Bond/Vesper interactions flow so crisply and soft. It's a joy to watch every second of it and I could be talking about it for hours.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, Casino Royale is a great novel and in my opinion, an even greater movie which is a faithful adaptation but also adds many layers and new things to it, knowing that it already is part of a 20+ movie series and therefore adding nostalgia, references or treating its timeless main characters legacy with honor and self reflection.

What do you think about Casino Royale, both the novel &amp; the movie?"
8,"With its sequel coming out 10 years later this year, what's your take on Zombieland? I think it's a pretty amusing and entertaining zombie comedy that basically stands and falls with the memorable performances of the cast. Some pretty clever ideas and fun interactions here and there, but even for its 85 minute runtime, it does feel quite pointless at times to be fair. Like, the first half is dominated by Eisenbergs voice over exposition and the second half is kind of nothing up until its climax. If you're a huge Bill Murray or Ghostbusters fan you might love the references but it really didn't do much more than that for me.

Fleischers directorial debut is at least idiosyncratic, though it does feel unfocused and a bit indulgent, in a way that Shaun of the Dead feels crisp and clean. Some jokes land really well, some of the action is fine & well the cast delivers.

Whats your take on Zombieland?"
8,"The Ultimate Cut of Watchmen (215 min.) is probably as close as we're ever going to get to a proper adaptation of one of the greatest graphic novels of all time. I'd start by this: A perfect screen adaptation of Watchmen is impossible. The comic book has to much stuff going on, it has the sub chapters, like Under the Hood or Newspaper reports, or historical metaphors and so on. Thematically important and very rich, especially for a lot of its characters, but practically impossible to really translate on to the big screen.

Yet I have to say this, the Ultimate Cut of Zack Snyder's Watchmen (2009) is probably as close as we're ever going to get. Make no mistake, even this extended version is missing some very good stuff of the novel:

\- the lesbian women subplot or the wife/family of the psychiatrist (both of which elevate the NY tragedy)

\- main characters are more heroes than humans (e.g. considerably more action than the novel)

\- Leaving out Max Shea

\- Spending a bit too little time on the Minutemen, political street conflict, game changer of Dr Manhattan

&#x200B;

But it even has some changes that work really well for the movie:

\- Rorschachs first kill with the butcher knife is probably as intense as the burning from the comic book

\- I personally like Nite Owl reacting to Rorschach being killed

\- the random alien from the comic book being replaced as Dr Manhattan as the threat for world peace is probably interchangeable to be honest

&#x200B;

And even if some of the points mentioned in the first paragraph would definitely elevate the movie, I do feel like they are nitpicks and Snyder manages to get most of the themes (yes, even if not as deep as the comic book), especially in the **Ultimate Cut**:

\- The Tales of the Black Freighter are terrific. While it would've been cool seeing Gerard Butler in 300 style action, I think the animated version is already really dark & tantalizing.

\- A lot of the Minutemen backstory is seen through flashbacks in the opening 

\- While we don't get that much stuff out of Hollis Mason, I love the inclusion of his sad death. It's not only a complete gut punch, but also a very important character moment for Nite Owl (and a nice scene swap with Rorschach)

&#x200B;

It's fascinating that, out of all people, Zack Snyder managed to recreate the vision of Alan Moore and one of the greatest pieces of literature fiction ever made. *Watchmen* isn't as rich (and probably timeless) as its graphic novel source material, but it's complex themes, picture perfect casting & atmosphere are the epitome of anything in the comic book medium. Its a tale of gratifying scope, enormous intimacy, the growing paranoia of the cold war, and the deconstruction of a street vigilante, the dichotomy of justice & peace and above else the human condition. 

It's impressively atmospheric, has a killer soundtrack & some absolutely terrific performances. 

Genuinely feel this is one of the strongest movies of its genre."
8,"Despite the hate it gets for the lack of ""cultural impact"" or in the current battle of highest grossing films ever, James Camerons Avatar (2009) is a.) still a groundbreaking technological achievement and b.) a grandiose concept Sci-Fi Adventure, even if it follows familiar story beats. Yes, I know that Avatar doesn‘t have the biggest cultural impact. It doesn‘t contain memorable characters, moments or music in the proportion that would justify it being the most successful movie of all time.

I also know that it‘s story isn‘t the most inventive and original. It does follow familiar story beats, of The Matrix, or Jurassic Park, or Star Wars or Dances with Wolves and so on.

But I‘d also like to say that it is still a grandios and huge Sci Fi Adventure story. Cameron doesn‘t change a formula, but he sharpens nearly every element in that formula to bring his personal vision onto the screen. His exposition & narrative is compelling and efficient. His love story is effective and convincing and does work as the backbone of the movie. His tech fetishes and details for world building are innovative and unique.

There‘s an overall glow of interconnection. The flying dragons with the hair, the energy of Pandora, its creatures & mythology. The humanity between the opposing races. It‘s vibrant & engaging storytelling. Cameron logically enhances every set piece, it gets bigger & richer as it goes on. His conceptual designs are vital & the conflict + resolution is bombastic.

It‘s also a technological master achievement. I can‘t imagine how it must‘ve felt watching it on the big screen. It‘s 10 years old and it still looks really great. While I do think that in a couple of years the CG & VFX won‘t be looking that great, the colors & set pieces are as organic as it can be.

What is your take on Avatar?"
8,"John Wick: Chapter 2 is a wonderful action symphony. John Wick (2014) was a surprise hit. It‘s a stone cold, rough & serious action movie with great choreography. But I have to say that I do feel it is a bit bland at times.

Yet everything slightly monotonous is the original is expanded in Chapter 2. The colours are bright & gorgeous.
There‘s so much cultural detail & visual depth in nearly every shot. From rooms or different shapes, mirrors & sizes of objects.

And the action is freaking insane. 
I love how it builds up to a Western climax with characters starring each other down before engaging in gun or knife fights. 
Reeves is absolutely fantastic in his delivery to his training as he kicks ass throughout the entire picture. 
Stahelski is probably the big game changer here as an acclaimed stunt coordinator, the tracking shots & action choreography are practically flawless.

What do you think about John Wick Chapter 2?"
8,"Bad Boys II is beyond any star ratings or reviews or boundaries of film criticism. - Racist KKK Michael Shannon

- Close Ups of Bullets & Slow Motion of one driving through Martin Lawrence‘s ass

- There is a 15 minute car chase with infinite jump cuts and you can‘t tell who‘s shooting at who. Let alone why.

- The villain is a mix of Tony Montana &amp; a Roger Moore Bond villain

- Everyone has anger issues

- Martin Lawrence interrogating dead criminals whose brains are on the wall

- Live porno on cameras of a video store

- **Rats fucking.** Literally.

- Carlos got mutiliated and put in a dustbin.

- Decapitated bodies are flying around windshields. 

- Greatest Dad Talk Sequence Ever.

- They are literally examining dead bodies and find drugs beneath the kidneys. 

- „Shit just got real“

- The villain gets shot in the head, falls to the ground and is blown into pieces by a landmine



Michael Bays machismo, in counterplay with Smith‘s &amp; Lawrence‘s (don‘t forget Joe Pantoliano) charisma sets up waves of infinite pornography &amp; violence. This is beyond any imagination of star ratings or reviews. 

This is the worst movie ever, 150 minutes of non sense. This is the greatest movie ever, 150 minutes of off-the-wall nuts and entertainment."
8,"Please don't start yelling and loudly cheering like you're in a theme park attraction while watching a movie in theaters. One year later after Infinity War and one week before Endgame, I really don't want to experience the same stuff again.

It's cool if you are a fan. It's cool if you are a fanboy. It's cool if you've watched all the MCU movies, feel attached to the characters, and want to see their destiny. 

But please, don't start yelling, or screaming, or loudly cheering in a movie theater packed with hundreds of other people who want to enjoy their movie. I sadly witnessed that last year while watching **Infinity War**, and after catching up on YouTube and seeing those ""reaction"" videos of teenage girls loudly screaming and crying in Iron Man v/ Thanos like they're watching a baseball game or are in a roller coaster, I wanted to address this. 

There are other people in the room who can't enjoy a movie they've paid the same price as you for, if you're constantly loud and weirdly fanboy-ish, to the point where it becomes obnoxious and uproarious. 

Cheers."
8,"Hell or High Water (2016) is a beautiful grown-up Modern Western. The moment it was over I immediately wanted to see it again. 

It has a darkly humorous but also rich and elegant screenplay by Taylor Sheridan, who is absolutely stunning in writing these Neo-Westerns (Sicario, Wind River). It has excellent performances throughout, Bridges absolutely nails it, so does Foster but Chris Pine's subtlety is astounding. 

It is a haunting movie about social anachronism and desperation. The banks, who take advantage of their locals are the bad guys (this making it even easier to root for our robbers), but the people working in the banks aren't, neither are, of course the cops. Everyone struggles, everyone feels so real and cleverly written. 

It's suspenseful, full of heart and anger and memorable scenery and memorable moments. 

What do you think about it? "
8,"What are some movies that unintentionally started cults, for example when people started idolizing a protagonist, that actually shouldn't be idolized? Some movies and or characters  that directly spring to my head are:

\* **Don Corleone** (The Godfather) - as people, especially in organized crime start taking him as some sort of role model of principles and stuff.

\* **Jordan Belfort** (The Wolf of Wall Street) - I can imagine especially some young people being overtaken by his undeniable charm and confuse ambition with greed. And then they start quoting him.

\* **Tyler Durden** (Fight Club) - probably the easiest example. The fact that there are literal fight clubs with guys beating themselves up thinking they are somehow revolting against a system and showing ""true"" masculinity is a bit worrying. 

&#x200B;

What are some other movies or movie characters that are weirdly idolized by some people, or to some extent even start a cult? "
8,"Wind River & Violence against Native Americans I don't live in the U.S. so the ending of Taylor Sheridan's ""Wind River"" made me a bit uncomfortable. 

Are there really no statistics of lost Native Americans, although there are for any other ethnic group? And, why is that so?

&#x200B;

I think that Sheridan did a wonderful job in telling his story, and I actually found Jeremy Renner as the lead to be incredibly powerful. It served as a relatable starting point to discover the relations and problems Native people have, even if I can understand the criticism of not casting a Native as the major lead.

It is a very sad movie with lots of gut punches, and a really solid script. I also like how it uses modern western conventions. It's action and shoot outs are never the purpose, they are pure consequence. The action is built up, but it's never long. That's something I also found in Sicario (2015) or Logan (2017).

What's your take on this?"
8,"What are your favorite / best horror movies of this decade? So, I'm probably going to see Peele's ""Us"" this week and I tried looking back at some good to great horror movies this decade.

I personally really loved last years **Hereditary** & **A Quiet Place**.

While not really my definition of ""great"", I actually really do like James Wans Insidious movies. The first is really scary, the second is really interesting, the third is fine, and even the fourth isn't at least a complete disaster. 

Otherwise, I'm not really that big on horror this decade, meaning I haven't seen that much.

\- George Lazenby 1 (60s)

&#x200B;

**EDIT: And here just some personal information opinion and stuff:**

\- I can understand that Bond movies, now built up as very big blockbusters shouldn't be released every year or two (thing is, there weren't that many blockbuster action movies back in the 1960s, so a Bond movie basically was the big movie of each year which take for example 2015, a year where next to SPECTRE movies like Age of Ultron, Star Wars 8, Fury Road, Revenant, Creed and so on also were released; isn't the case anymore). But I think 3 years is a solid gap and not the 5 we get now.

\- Connery IS James Bond and there's probably nothing that'll change that. He also has the hottest streak of good to great Bond movies (for me from Dr. No, FRWL, Goldfinger & Thunderball).

\- Still, I actually love Daniel Craig's interpretation of Bond and Casino Royale isn't only my favorite Bond movie, but also in my opinion one of the greatest movies ever made. SkyFall is also top tier, especially at how gorgeous it looks (apart from BR49 this is maybe my favorite of Deakins work this decade).

\- I'd like to call Brosnan's Bond Rambo wearing a suit. His later movies may be considered generic action flicks but they sure deliver some memorable and engaging action sequences (apart from DAD which, you know, obviously has these atrocious VFX). GoldenEye though is something special and at least for me a masterclass in action.

\- Roger Moore holds the title for most Bonds and that's totally fine. The cheese in his movies ranks from working really great (TSWLM), to fine (TMWTGG, LALD), to really bad (last two ones). Lazenby is well Lazenby, OHMSS is a good film but he's just too wooden for me to be Bond. Dalton is actually really good, and both of his movies, especially LTK are solid thrillers. I think he should've done at least one more.

&#x200B;

**EDIT 2:** I was not counting Connery‘s „unnofficial“ Bond in the 80s

What do you think about this?"
8,"The Sisters Brothers is fuck'n great! Just walked out of a limited showing in Germany (opened a week ago here) and am quite disappointed to read that it didn't do very well financially in the US when it came out last year.

For me, there's nothing quite like a well made Western. Just great atmosphere, set pieces, dialogue and performances.

I feel like it's an overall great homage to brothership and brotherly love. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a great performance, obviously not on par with some of his best stuff (though that's tough considering The Master could easily be considered the greatest acting achievement of the decade), but overall very convincing and engaging in every scene. Loved the comedic, and also heartwarming output of John C Reilly and Gyllenhaal & Ahmed were surprisingly effective for the time they were given.

It's just a very good western, has an engaging storyline with compelling characters and looks really great. Would easily say it's one of my favorite movies of the year so far (counting German release as I do always).

Have you seen it, and if yes what did you think about it?"
8,"What's the most game-changing action movie ever made? I just finished **The Matrix** after not having seen it in years and it completely struck me, even more than on first viewing. It's honestly one of the most unique movies ever made. Everything from its atmosphere, tone, characters, world building and especially action seems so unique and memorable.

I feel like this is the movie that in general changed the action genre for the 21 century. That's not to say pre 21. century hadn't great action films - Some of my all time favorite action films are from the 80/90s, Point Break, Die Hard, T2 and so on. 

The big difference I recognized was how much those were focussed on chases, whatever it was, and spectacle, than one on one combat. Take Keanu Reeves chasing Patrick Swazye and shooting his gun in the air going Aaaargh, or the whole motorcycle chase in T2, or John McClane doing John McClane things or the fucking Tank chase in GoldenEye. It's never fully about the one on one combat. And the Matrix completely changed that, not only making one on one combat and fight electrifying, specific and detailed, but also using it as a storytelling tool.

What's in your opinion the most game changing action movie and what do you think about The Matrix? "
8,"Despite all the bank robbing, surfing, shooting punks, lighting bonfires in the beach and shooting your gun in the air while screaming, ""Point Break"" is essentially a wonderful story about friendship. Yes, I agree that it is corny and cheesy and over the top and its plotting is thin and its dialogue is poor and  and and but I always end up feeling something when watching Point Break.

Yes, it is entertaining and enjoyable and has some great scenes, but I feel it has genuine heart. 

It's hard for me to put into words but the movie really does have some of those special moments. Loud music, waves or light or dust. It has this atmosphere of transcending and at its core two men.

*I'll see you in the next life!* "
8,"The Johnny English movies/trilogy are among my personal favorite comedies. Today I watched [Johnny English Strikes Again](https://letterboxd.com/film/johnny-english-strikes-again/) after having sadly missed it at theaters a few months ago and as a huge fan of the two first movies, as well as Rowan Atkinson and the spy (spoof) genre as a whole I loved every second of it.

I think the movie(s) just know so well to play their strengths. It's wonderful to see a contained small comedy with a very engaging lead (Rowan Atkinson is [64 years old and still doing some of the best fucking physical comedy I've seen)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkBID2mdCMI) and just.. heart to it.

Bough (Ben Miller) actually returns as his assistant and it was so fresh to see for me (even though I really LOVED Kaluuya in the second one). The duo brought for some really fun engaging interactions, delivering jokes in a consistent pace and introducing memorable gadgets, tricks and set pieces. The VR scene being my personal favorite of the bunch. And yet again we have a former Bond girl taking on the role of a Johnny English girl and Olga Kurylenko was really great. Heck, the movie even had cameos of Charles Dance & Michael Gambon.

The stuff I didn't love completely were Emma Thompson (who was nowhere near as great as Gillian Anderson in the first one) and the villain (who also couldn't compete with the likes of Dominic West & John Malkovich of the first two), but the idea of a billionaire using data and internet to gain power.. was comparably interesting for a spy spoof.

I have to say that all of the three movies, therefore also the third, follow predictable plot structures and aren't cinematic masterpieces, but I just feel like it's a very well paced action comedy with great performances and clever ideas and a heart at its core.

&#x200B;

What do you think about Johnny English 3 or the franchise as a whole?"
8,"While I can probably never fully hate a Pirates movie, I must admit that the last one (2017) completely forget what made Jack Sparrow and the franchise great. The first hour or so has some of the most lifeless directing and writing I have seen in quite some time. Like literally, for 60+ minutes Jack Sparrow is either drunk or tired or mumbling weird stuff. And he doesn't really get that much better after that. In the first, but also 2-3, even in the fourth he was a comparably sloppy pirate, but someone who always had a plan. There are so many scenes in the first movie where he's just a complete genius, outsmarting everyone around him. 

Here he trades his fucking compass for a bottle of rum (!!). And then they even changed the origin of the compass. Remember how mysterious and interested Jack was in William Turner when he met him in the first Pirates film after knowing he's the son of Bootstrap Bill? Here he meets Henry and hasn't even gotten pants on. Every scene he's in is played for comedic purposes. There are these shots on the ship and everything feels so lifeless - like it's not Jack Sparrow on that ship but it's a crew on a set doing their job.

*It doesn't feel like an adventure movie filled with comedy, it felt like a comedy filled with adventure.* 

Even when they introduce the fantastical elements in the beginning, none of the ""mythology"" behind it is really captivating. And for all I love Javier Bardem and his (admittedly cool) Spanish accent, his crew of Ghosts are by far the least interesting in the Pirates henchmen - even the zombies from Stranger Tides are more interesting. And then there was this witch that the British used, like wtf and even Barbossa didn't do much besides.. idk.. are there for mildly interesting plot twists?

I can't hate a Pirates of the Caribbean movie. This one had one really gorgeous scene, it's ironic that the most exciting action scene was the Jack Sparrow flashback. I thought the last act was some entertaining and enjoyable adventure stuff with some okay conflict, I generally thought the movie was well shot, some rhythmic camera work and drone shots, and well, I love pirates, ships and everything to do with that. Admittedly the ending stuff was fan service at its finest, but I bought it as a life long POTC fan.

&#x200B;

I guess the over all problem with this movie is that it made Jack Sparrow, the sloppy but underneath genius pirate a running gag who's constantly drunk or tired. The two younger leads were.. fine but lacked the charisma of lets say Elizabeth & Will to ""headline"" a movie, and the overall structure and conflict isn't new at all.

What do you think about this movie and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise as a whole?"
8,"PTA‘s The Master is one of my favourite movies of all time There is this undeniably sense for passion in every frame of Paul Thomas Andersons ""The Master"". The visual style of the color palette, nearly nostalgic yet always on the bridge to transcend (I believe this to be in the most perfectly shot movies this decade), Johnny Greenwoods insinuating score, that tackles every bit of nuance and emotion the movie wants to achieve and Paul Thomas Andersons stone cold, flawless command of every scene are not only remarkable, but astounding.

Yet it is the performance of the two antithetical men at its front and center that make ""The Master"" the masterpiece that it is and the sum of its extraordinary pieces.
Freddie Quell symbolizes an animalistic desire. A war veteran who is completely lost physically, socially and sexually. He can't stay in one place, he gets tired, gets irritated, jumps to the next idea, aimless, pointless, desperate and yet bitterly cold. He cannot live out his sexual fantasies the more he wants to. He can not find sympathy or social connections. If anything at its surface, ""The Master"" is a take on the terrorizing and intimidating trauma of an unforgiving past.
Joaquin Phoenix physique is breathtaking - it is as if his body is trying to tear him down, he can barely stand tall. And yet the small pieces, him screaming in the prison cell, lying on the ship, speaking out his bitter past and experiences, are where you see the picture perfect performance of this actor.
Lancaster Dodd and Freddie Quell are antithetical in a way that they need each other to complement and fulfill their own character.
While Philipp Seymour Hofmann, quite like PTA himself, commands every scene and every dialogue, he is not the man he wants to be.
In their last confrontation it's obvious how much he needs Freddie and how much he can not achieve inner piece.
And, Freddie riding the motorcycle into the wide range of the desert isn't setting him free.
In the end, Freddie is where he started, he is alone, sexually uninspired, he still stumbles across earth meaningless, but the influence ""The Master"" had on him is undeniable, as he tries to recreate the processing scene with a woman.
Maybe it is true, maybe some people just are meant for each other.


What do you think about this?"
8,"Kong: Skull Island (2017) had some really great cinematography for a blockbuster This and the fight scenes were definitely the best thing about it.

Loved how director of photography Larry Fong (yeah this guy probably has a fetish for big battle scenes, BvS, 300, Predator) brought so much life into Kong: Skull Island. It all felt like a moving rhythm, and the background was always in motion sometimes with flying dust or yellow-green-ish lighting, it looked really cool.

And the fight scenes, like they were taken out of some WWE 2K game. Especially the last one between Kong and the Skull Crawler had this huge gigantomania feeling with them wrestling for leverage throwing each other around and stuff.

It all just felt, idk, more compelling and engaging than lets say the Transformers movies or some of the MCU fight scenes.

Things I disliked were Samuel L Jackson turning temporarily villain and the movie over staying its welcome by quite a bit. Otherwise I thought Kong Skull Island was really good for what it was supposed to be.

What do you think about this?"
8,"Should Mission Impossible just ""end"" with MI 8 in 2022, because I honestly think it's impossible to recast Ethan Hunt. Not that Tom Cruise is too synonymous with the role himself, Sean Connery is the epitome of James Bond, arguably the most iconic movie character of all time, and he got recast numerous times in the course of the years.

I just feel like, after Mission Impossible 8, when Cruise is 60 years old, and hopefully not performing life risking stunt work, the franchise should rest and so should Ethan.

I would not like to see Ethan Hunt ""age"", so that he becomes some sort of mentor or stuff and I'd also not want him to be recast either, because no one could seemingly step into Cruise's footsteps.

What are your thoughts on this?

**EDIT:**

So here are some possibilities:

**1.** Letting the franchise calm down after MI 7&8, remembering it as a 25 year tour with a terrific Tom Cruise

**2.** Create Spin-Offs, that feature the IMF, but not Ethan Hunt, you could a.) recast everyone or b.) take some actors on the way (unlikely)

**3.** ""Expand"" the universe and create a new IMF agent in the same timeline as Ethan Hunt & Cruise. Though this would have the consequence of Ethan Hunt getting old and losing the ""timeless"" status that some may want.

**4.** Re casting Ethan Hunt, like James Bond, recasting another actor for the role, you could act in many possible ways (Judi Dench continued M even when Brosnan and Craig changed), so you'd either have to act as if everything is in a different ""timeline"" or everything is just the same, including Ethan who's now played by someone else.

I'd prefer 1. actually."
8,"Enemy (2013) isn‘t only one of Denis Villeneuve‘s best films, it also features Jake Gyllenhaal at his finest Gyllenhaal has had some genuinely amazing performances, for the most part movies like Prisoners, Nightcrawler, Donnie Darko or Brokeback Mountain.
What makes Enemy so special is that while in all the others he played a normal one-sided character, here he is given the space and room to fully embrace all of his acting in the widest spectrum imaginative.

He perfectly switches between staggering, introverted and disconnected to confident, sociopathic and dominant. It‘s truly amazing.

Enemy is a movie that you‘ll find numerous interpretations or analytical essays or „explanations“ on the internet and that‘s just perfectly fine. A work of art is always more intelligent than its artist, because it (when it‘s precisely executed) allows for more than the writer, director, generally creator probably imagined.

But I just wanna focus on what makes it great for a movie on its own. It‘s like a David Lynch movie mixed with Franz Kafka. Dreadful, disoriented, haunting. The yellow imagery, the nervy, uncomfortable long sequences. The starring, the sexual tension, the, as mentioned above, performances. It adds up just perfectly. 

What do you think about Enemy? "
8,"Macbeth (2015) is one of the most visually striking and impressive, and altogether hauntingly epic movies of this decade. *All hail Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!*

When people talk about ""Shakespearean proportions"", they should have Justin Kurzel's Macbeth as the primary example.  
Vicious, haunting, dreadful, and oh so beautiful. The colors and contrasts hammer onto the canvas. The picture mixes in totalities of dreamlike symbols and landscapes. There are few movies in which genuinely every frame could be hung as a painting, and this is one of them.  
You have color settings that reach from blood red, sky blue to dark grey, always in interaction or counterplay with contrary patterns and tones.  
Everything is in motion, every movement either requires action or intent. If the characters aren't moving (like in the many dialogues), their background is, either the waves, the dust, candle fire, and when the characters are in motion (like in the opening, or climatic battle scenes) everything doubles on intensity.  
Adam Arkapaw's cinematography (yes, this guy shot the first season of HBO's True Detective) has to be some of the best this decade has to offer.

It's a movie so hauntingly beautiful that it nearly makes me forget all of Shakespeare's initial themes and motives. Yet Fassbender and Cotillard are such a pleasure to watch that nothing is lost. The former even adds a sort of PTSD reaction to Macbeth. At its center it still remains a tale about greed, deception, madness, tyranny and ultimately downfall.  
The cold grey-blue-ish style of Macbeth in the opening is matched with a hot, burning image of blood and scars in the end.

Macbeth is one of the most visually astounding, impressive and altogether hauntingly epic movies I have seen.

8,"Why is the letterboxd community... so weird? I love using letterboxd, especially the diary function. It's a nice way for me to see which movies I loved most every month, or have an overview how much I saw and so on. I also like that the user has a wider profile, with actually commentary or favorite movies list up. 

But every time I want to read reviews on it, I'm just completely taken away by the major community. It's like a huge circle jerk of indulgent self congratulatory somehow woke jokes and catchphrases. And always be the same 3-5 accounts. Examples like:

>so here’s my main issue with this movie: stellan skarsgard has eight kids, four of whom are actors, and they cast an outsider as young bill anderson!!! now i understand that alexander is 40 and that bill is too pennywisey to be in fun movies but did you know there’s a 22 year old valter skarsgard? the one im banking on marrying to sneak my way into the skarsgard empire? if you’re not gonna cast the actual spawn of stellan why wouldn’t you do what you did in the first movie and just put the older actors in young wigs and makeup and pretend they’re 20? i have many grievances already but this is top priority

or

>white men scream under bad lighting with sepia filter: the movie

or

>i know this is gonna sound like i'm making this up but when i saw this tonight a couple of (white) people were talking super loud during the movie & when they were asked to leave they angrily refused & eventually had to be escorted off the premises by police who kept saying to them ""GET OUT""  
>  
>it was truly the most surreal experience i have ever had in a movie theater

&#x200B;

Is this something in particular that I don't get or are these types of people just.. incredibly weird, annoying and got a huge amount of possibly even weirder and more annoying fans?

While you're at it, could you recommend me some good reviewers on the site, so I don't have to always look into the ""popular reviews"" to find this sort of trash? Thanks!

8,"Despite some of its overly ridiculous elements I actually enjoy Pirates of the Caribbean 4: On Stranger Tides I was re watching some clips of it on YouTube and remembered how much I actually enjoy the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.

The fourth installment generally gets a lot of backlash, and I can definitely understand why. The mermaid stuff is kinda trash, some of the elements with the dolls or the completely faceless Spanish antagonists are very dull.

But I still feel it's really good as another Jack Sparrow adventure spin-off after the trilogy. Johnny Depp still is motivated enough, Jack Sparrow for the most part is still written as the clever and calculative, even if stumbling pirate (which he sadly isn't in 5), I really enjoy Cruz & McShane as the new supporting characters, especially Blackbeard is a cool villain and seeing some familiar faces like Barbosa or Gibbs return always makes me appreciate it as a franchise movie.

The music is engaging and the set pieces, costumes and so on seem top notch. I believe it is the most expensive movie ever made (?), although it doesn't reach the immense scope of the third one.

Of course it's ridiculous, and some elements are plain bad, but it's still fun, entertaining, with enough franchise mythology to keep it alive as a spin-off."
8,"Watch Paddleton (2019) - It's definitely one of the better Netflix movies. **Summary** on [imdb.com](https://imdb.com): 

An unlikely friendship between two misfit neighbors becomes an unexpectedly emotional journey when the younger man is diagnosed with terminal cancer.

Director: Alex Lehmann

Writers: Mark Duplass, Alex Lehmann

Starring: Mark Duplass, Ray Romano

Runtime: 89 minutes

&#x200B;

**My opinion:**

Sweet and moving story about male friendship.  
Granted, it's not really that eventful, but it's told in a slow, small scale way that it really touches the heart.  
""Paddleton"" also rarely overdoes this sort of emotion, never feeling forced and nearly always feeling very real.  
The lead performances by Romano & Duplass are engaging in a very subtle way. Much of the dialogue seems improvised, adding to that ""realness"". Their chemistry is what makes the movie, it's filled with intentionally cringe inducing and awkward moments, some of them humorous, but all of them in one way or another sad.

It's a small story about friendship, quiet, sometimes quirky and has honestly earned emotions.

&#x200B;

I'd definitely recommend this as a 90 minute watch. It's definitely one of the better Netflix movies that have come out the past 2 months. "
8,"Only The Brave (2017/18) flew under the radar of too many people I'm currently making my list (by watching, rewatching or remembering) of the best movies released in Germany 2018 and this makes my top 10.

It's sad to see it only having barely 10k ratings on letterbox and not even 50k on imdb.

It's a real life, comparably tragic story, that goes pretty much without any cheese or theatrics. It's brutally honest and really wonderful. 

While I agree that it's runtime of 130+ minutes is a bit too long, its filled with some really great performances, Brolin is as likable as he was never before, I think this is a very enjoyable and emotionally challenging movie.

What do you think about it?"
8,"Sicario 2 is a dark and competent movie, that just feels.. pointless While it hasn't got anything that made Denis Villeneuve's Sicario a bottomline great movie - Emily Blunt, Roger Deakins & Johan Johannsson - it still has a fitting score, fine cinematography and really good acting especially Josh Brolin. But it also seems incredibly pointless.

The way its going in the beginning, loosely connected acts of terrorism, it's fine. I thought it was gonna be an interesting movie about border, cartel, politics with some dark and suspenseful imagery. But then it kinda goes full action, and its action isn't even good. The whole second half with the kidnapped girl storyline or the weird boy who becomes a sicario feels very.. pointless (?). Like what was the point in that? A sequel? What was the big deal with the ending scene? Like, who was the villain now? What was the antagonists motivation? Is anything set up in the beginning actually resolved?

There are still entertaining and engaging moments; the store explosion or Benicio del Toro going Punisher, but the script really lets the movie down, especially considering it was written by Taylor Sheridan (Sicario, Wind River, Hell or High Water). 

What do you think about Sicario 2?

8,"What are the movies with best cinematography of the 21. century so far? So, what are the most gorgeously, interestingly and beautifully shot movies of the 21. century. I'd go like this:

**The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford** *2007*  
I mean, I believe this to be Deakins best work. Practically every frame could be hung as a literal frame as a wallpaper. The train robbery, the simply conversations, the actual assassination; so much ingenious lighting, symmetry, silhouettes and so on.

**Roma** *2018*  
Alfonso Cuaron with gloves of practically. Every frame can be analyzed and is part of the beautiful and haunting bigger picture of Roma. It has these static wide shots, or the long takes (many many of them), scenes like the child birth, forest fires or the waves are near perfection.

**There Will be Blood** *2007*  
The huge, and I mean really huge scope of PTA's epic is perfectly captured by Robert Elswit. 

**The Master** *2012*  
This is the most uniquely shot movie of the century in my opinion . I'm just going to leave you with [this](http://evanerichards.com/2013/3066).

So, what are in your opinion the movies with best cinematography of the 21. century?"
8,"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a hauntingly beautiful masterpiece. Flawless in every aspect of filmmaking. I am an emotional train wreck. I am so flustered after watching this movie, I‘m still sitting here in tears. This is one of my favourite movies of all time.

Rodger Deakins cinematography is out of this world beautiful. There is an early shot where Jesse James is waiting for a train to arrive and we see his shadow image and it is one of the most gorgeous shots in film history. The music by Nick Cave is nervy, hauntingly beautiful and insinuating. 
Brad Pitts performance is flawless, there are shots of him just sitting in a chair and smiling and I can‘t stop being amazed by the beauty of the frame. Casey Affleck puts on his career defining performance. He is as perfect as someone could be as Robert Ford.

The storyline beautifully adapted into film is tragic and magical in scope. It‘s unsettling, yet deeply awe inspiring, destabilising yet incredibly fulfilling. 

I don‘t know what else to say. I‘m just gonna listen to that music score and leave it at that. It‘s been very long since a movie has moved me that much. 

What do you think about The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford? "
8,"Die Hard 2 is basically an airport-instead-of-skyscraper copy of its predecessor, but it still works incredibly well Die Hard 2 feels like the most obvious sequel you would get to a movie action classic like Die Hard.

You have the **cop** who **unintentionally** gets clustered up in some sort of big terrorist situation (only this time McClane doesn't hesitate to kick ass), you have the overlying sweet **love story** with his wife Holly, you have a group of **young and cool thugs** serving as henchmen for the big boss villain, you have **the douchebag cop**, you have the **annoying press** / news, you have some sort of **navy** conspiracy where a guy of high stand actually works with the baddies and you have **the dumb, but likable and charming allies** of John McClane.

Despite all of this ""formulaic"" retelling, I still had tons of fun with Die Hard 2. This might be one of Willis' most engaging performances he's ever put on, the one liners (though not all seem to land as perfectly as in the first) are clever and slick, the side characters, even when being cliches are fun and the action, while not having the most excellent combat choreography is compelling and thoroughly enjoyable. 

I believe the Yippie-Ki-Yay pun is absolutely incredibly placed and timed and the film concludes wonderfully.

Of course it's not on the level of the first Die Hard, the biggest ""downgrade"" being the main villain, who obviously does not stand a chance to Hans Gruber.

Still, this is one of the most pleasing action movies of the 80/90s in my opinion. What's your take on Die Hard 2?"
8,"Though I'd very much like to see more Creed movies, after watching Creed II I really would love to see a Viktor Drago spin-off Like some sort of national boxing in Russia for example, without starring Adonis or Rocky. I mean Creed II was a really good Rocky movie, had some great moments of pathos, great music and engaging fights, although of course being predictable. In the end, I really came to like Viktor Drago.

I'd love to see a spin-off around him and his father. It would be a ""Rocky"" movie, that doesn't have to necessarily follow the same formula like the 8 movies now have pretty much done. It can have different approaches to its main protagonist and kinda set apart from the known formula. 

Plus I think that Florian Munteanu was really great as Viktor Drago.

What do you think about a Viktor Drago spin-off?  "
8,"I'd like to watch some ""classic"" action movies from the 80-00s. What are some of your recommendations? I was rewatching Edgar Wrights Hot Fuzz today, a simply fantastic movie in arguably my favorite movie trilogy ever (Cornetto trilogy) and like with every new watch of the movie I found myself just being completely thrilled by it. 

Of course it's ""mocking"" or I'd say paying homage to classic action movies as Point Break or Bad Boys II are even a plot point.

Now I really want to get into some older action movie ""classics"". Not really classics or cinematic masterpieces, but just movies with great one liners, engaging action and that ooze some sort of coolness. Of course I've watched the obvious ones like Die Hard etc but I'm sure there's some stuff you could recommend me?

&#x200B;

Thanks!"
8,"Edgar Wrights ""The World's End"" isn't only incredibly hilarious, but also genuinely beautiful. This movie nearly got tears out of me. I consider both Hot Fuzz & especially Shaun of the Dead to be bonafide masterpieces, but it wasn't until todays re visiting of The World's End that I would also put this up on that level.

While I feel like we could have seen a little bit more of Rosamund Pike, and the ending prologue wasn't needed at that length ""The World's End"" is full of quotable dialogue, idiosyncratic editing, camera & frame work, has an absolutely fantastic ensemble cast and delivers so many laugh out loud moments. I mean, I won't even dare to point some jokes and one-liners out because a) there are too many to choose from and b) not choosing everything would be disrespectful as there is so much great stuff. It also contains so many great cameos and supporting roles.

But I think it really hit me on that emotional nostalgia level. It had genuine moments of heart, and moments of self-awareness. It knew what to do with every character it has and it worked out practically the full potential of it. The "" Get back in your rocket, and fuck off back to Legoland you cunts! "" felt like such a satisfying moment. But I even think that before the movie turned into Sci-fi it already got me on that "" I remember sitting up there, blood on my knuckles, beer down my shirt, sick on my shoes and seeing the orange glow of a new dawn break and knowing in my heart life would never feel this good again. And you know what? It never did."" nostalgia feeling.

What do you think about ""The World's End""?"
8,"The themes of Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" (1958), police corruption, prejudice and vengeance are still relevant after 60+ years I don't want to go into politics and shit now but I recently revisited Orson Welles last film-noir ""Touch of Evil"" and the movie resonated with me much more than I thought.

It has this ingenious 4 minute tracking shot opening (was something like that possible back then?), 3 incredible performances Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh & Orson Welles, intrigue, suspense, and above all it's themes still seem so relevant. Like the corrupt police officer (Orson Welles) using everything to avenge Charlton Hestons Mexican (yeah that casting may be questionable today). It also features some of the best symbolism, like when the cop wants to both figuratively and literally wash his hands but the water he's washing them in is dirty >!so he falls into the dirt and dies.!< Or the ""rape"" / drug scene.

It's one of my favorite film-noirs, though I do still prefer The Third Man (1949).

What do you think about Touch of Evil?"
8,"Why do movies about Ancient Egypt, Roman or Greek mythology always tend to be so shitty? I'm talking about movies like Gods of Egypt, or Wrath of Titans, Clash of Titans, Percy Jackson 1&2, Hercules The Thracian Wars, Immortals, or the recent Troy TV show and so on.

I mean these cultures have some of the greatest stories in all mythology.

How does one studio after another completely fuck up?

EDIT: Gladiator is a masterpiece that I wouldn‘t count.

EDIT 2: I think Snyder‘s 300 is a great action film but it‘s far away from capturing true Ancient Greek pathos and mythology, as its based on a comic book (that of course is based on mythology but you get the point).

EDIT 3: Isn‘t it kinda sad that the stories that set the foundation for practically all other stories that followed, can not be told properly? "
8,"What's a movie that you feel like you enjoy much more because you enjoyed it in your childhood? *So, not necessarily nostalgia in a way that the movie completely makes you feel how you were during the time you watched this movie, but more in a way that you have experienced the movie and know very much about it. Also you keep in mind how you reacted to certain scenes when you first watched it and how you react today.*

For me, this movie is **Men in Black (1997)**. Whenever I see this on some platform and I want to rate it, I don't know what to give it. I mean, it's no cinematic masterpiece.

But it's practically 100 minutes of top notch entertainment. It has two very charismatic lead performances by Smith & TLJ, it has a rock solid pacing, I feel like everything flows together perfectly in terms of set up, confrontation and resolution, memorable side & alien characters and a very cool villain.

I mean the movie spends quite some time with Vincent D'Onofrio stumbling across and killing regular people and it's funny (and disgusting) together.

But I feel like the biggest strength of the movie is its balance of how much it takes itself serious.

While the premise and storyline on paper is completely ridiculous, it never feels over the top and cheesy in execution. The action isn't too disgustingly violent and neither is the movie full of gags and satire. But it has a lot of heartfelt humor and humor that especially works as character related humor.

The CGI hasn't aged that well, but that's practically the only thing that I felt while re-watching it and I felt very similar when I watched it the first time (at least how I remember).

8,"If a movie imitates or makes fun of a specific genre, and then still falls for the tropes of that genre, I don't consider that to be particularly clever or ""intelligent"". Some thoughts on Deadpool (2016) So recently I re-watched Deadpool, after having liked it the first time. The first time around I thought it was really unique and I laughed really much, Ryan Reynolds was great and the experience of the comedic and sexual blood was quite fun.

Now, re-watching it I kinda feel weird. So, some jokes don't land as well as they did the first time around but basically I did not really like the structure and the way it was presented, as some sort of obviously superhero genre imitation.

\- It feels massively self congratulatory and all of these fourth wall breaks kinda come across as some sort of CinemaSins commentary. Like, writing something lame or stupid, and then directly commenting on this same decision. 

\- Then there's this meaningless ultra violence, and I'm a fan of meaningless ultra violence even in comedies but this was a comedy and had this weird graphic and completely meaninglessly serious torture scene in it.

\- There are also these weird attempts for ""philosophical"" meta bits and they also just come across as lazily written dialogue that wants to say ""hey we are mocking our own movie""

\- And then the movie also falls for generic superhero movie tropes like the shitty villain, or the forgettable action, or the boring hench-woman, or the love story, or the lame set up, confrontation and climax.

The movie has all these flaws, and then it just directly says to the audience that it well, has these flaws so people just take that as some sort of clever self awareness.

What do you think about Deadpool?"
8,"The Third Man (1949) is the all-time great film-noir. A gut-wrenching tale about American optimism and Post-War Europe Holly writes generic Western movies. American tales about good and evil, comfortable tales, with happy endings for forgettable enjoyment.
When he sets up to visit and work for, then trying to investigate the death of an old friend, Harry Lime in Post-War Europe he finally gets to see the bigger picture.

The essential story of The Third Man is American optimism and the contrast of Post-War Europe, Vienna in this case.
Arriving in Vienna, there are little to no friendly faces. He meets the alleged friends of Harry Lime. Kurtz, Dr Winkle & Popescu. All of them are shifty, vicious, uncontrolled, opportunistic, lying and corrupt people. Something that our protagonist is never quite able to grasp.
The movie has been praised for its cinematography, but cinematography is nothing if it doesn't evoke some sort of emotion, some sort of over all tone and atmosphere. The setting, the irrigated streets and the crumbling buildings, the stylish noir lighting and completely inclined and oblique shots all tell us something about the city and it's people. Life is frustrating, crying for help, but drowning in existential fears. Nothing is optimistic, nothing expresses any sort of happiness. This is not only shown through cinematography but also by the characters behaving, and talking. Multiple names are swapped, mistaken. Our love angle Anna continuously mistakes Holly, for her lover Harry. Dr Winkle demands to be called ""Winkel"", and even our protagonist calls the police officer Collohan, instead of Calloway. Holly is never able to grasp the cynical mindset of Vienna. He is trusting, yet he is naive and weak.

Harry Lime has become a high profile criminal, his allies rule the black market. The police, divided into 4 nationalities, who are also never able to communicate with the people, are used to it, yet take too much time to do something against it. Harry Lime quotes:
""You know what the fellow said: In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love--they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.""
People need to suffer, for other people to succeed. He has no problem with that as long as he profits of it.
Speaking of Harry Lime, he may have the most famous character introduction in the history of motion pictures. Now, we all know that Orson Welles will eventually show up and Harry Lime isn't dead after all, but his charisma is completely off-the-charts. From the slow built, the cat walk (with hint), Holly's anger, the sudden lighting, and that infamous smile, this has to be one of the most memorable moments in all of cinema. Orson Welles delivers such a strong, gripping and unique performance that he nearly, but only nearly, completely overshadows Joseph Cottons fantastic lead performance.

One of the key aspects of this movie is the tragic love of Holly for Anna, who will always love Harry, no matter if he cares or not. And he doesn't. Film-noir should always emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations, with a desperate male at its front and center.
The Third Man is no exception. Throughout the movie Holly falls in love with Anna, but she can not give him the satisfaction.
Holly fails to impress, and ""win"" Anna in the end because he keeps hold of his American optimism. I will get the lady if I help her, I will be the hero for shooting the bad guy. But this motive does not work on the large scale.
Harry tells him ""The world doesn't make any heroes outside of your stories."" When Holly finally kills the wanted criminal he thinks he is the hero. But he isn't. Every attempt he has made to be the typical American hero is unforgivingly dismembered.
In the end, he acts heroic and morally correct - and he loses everything; the one friend he had in life and the one love he thought he could have.
I believe that last shot is a mad act of pure brilliance. The movie closes as it opens. At Harry Limes funeral, Holly and the police officer in the car, Hollys glance at Anna and his decision to say goodbye. The sequence is disturbingly long and immensely uncomfortable. Anna's unspeakable cynicism is the final thing we see.

The Third Man (1949) is arguably the greatest film-noir ever made. It's shifting layers, thought provoking themes, nuanced performances, countless set ups, confrontations and resolutions, as well as it's cinematography and depiction of tragedy are timeless.

8,"Layer Cake (2004, Matthew Vaughn) is an intelligent crime thriller with a terrific Daniel Craig Finally got around watching Matthew Vaughn's ""Layer Cake"" (which is now my favorite movie of his) and this genuinely felt like a Martin Scorsese rise and fall crime epic, just as a British pendant.

The best part of the movie for me is definitely Daniel Craig, this performance must have surely given him the role of James Bond, even if he basically is on the other side of morality here. But I recognized that some shots felt really close to Casino Royale, like the paranoia or shower scene, which came out roughly 2 years later. Starting with that typical gangster narration the movie sells Craig as a different kind of criminal, calculative, discreet and dry, yet not emotionally unavailable.

The movie also has some very intelligent moments, the clean script probably leads more or less back to it being a book adaptation, but it easily manages the 2-3 storylines and even perfectly intertwines them. It also has some really nice humor to it, not too much, but it's cleverly placed when the movie needs it.

For me M Night Shyamalan. He's practically Hit or Miss. Unbreakable is a fantastic movie, a virtually perfect approach to a realistic ""super-hero"". It works on nearly every level and never fails to impress after 18+ years.

But he can also direct stuff like that horrible Last Airbender movie, or the completely tonally confused Glass.

When David Dunn & The Beast started running at each other I literally couldn‘t hide my excitement. Are we actually getting this? 
And then McAvoys performance, so brilliantly nuanced and detailed. And then the first time we see Mr Glass in 19 years.

And then it kinda went of the rails. None of it felt „real“, none of it felt like it was worthy of following Unbreakable. The weird escape and then fight plot line. The weird ending choices and main plot line. The 2 hour + runtime and constant narrative. The best moments were definitely the call backs to both prequels, but this just proves that the movie doesn‘t work as a stand alone.

If it wasn‘t for McAvoys and some of the beginning (some genuinely interesting moments and shots), this would‘ve been disastrous.

8,"Movies that start out great, but fall apart at a certain point? What's a movie that starts out great and then, lets say has a disappointing third act, or just doesn't pick up the same quality as it had before.

Baby Driver for me.

Slick soundtrack, great action, cool performances, memorable characters, and it oozes with a certain kind of coolness. Even when the movie kicks into the plot it's very fun and clever.

But then there's the weird character turn by Kevin Spacey who just happens to completely turn good, then Jon Hamm becomes some sort of T-1000 super villain and the movie practically loses all of its quality. Also didn't like how it ended, all felt just a bit too unoriginal, or out of place, completely not-like-Edgar-Wright.

&#x200B;

What's a movie that you'd pick for starting great, then losing quality? "
8,"Drive (2011) feels like a movie cut in half, but in a good way. Drive is a very popular movie, but I've never gotten around to watching it actually, so I finally did today.

The first half of the movie feels like a very unique love story with some twists here and there, Goslings private life as a driver, and on the other hand Irene's returning husband from prison. It gives us a fairly good insight on the introverted driver and how he interacts with the other characters.

But then, after the husbands death the movie completely transforms into a violent blood opera. I didn't expect the movie to be this brutal, but it damn sure was. It was extremely graphic and violent in execution.

Goslings acting was fantastic, some of the best stuff he's pulled out ever. The cinematography was excellent, it took its time, but I for my own, was **never** bored. And I really loved how it essentially played out.

I still need some time to fully deconstruct the movie and give my thoughts on what it means, what theme wanted it to transport, or what arcs were pulled of. I think it's essentially, our unknown driver finding something that's worth fighting for.

Please share some of your thoughts on the movie! Thanks!"
8,"I'm always baffled at how many people think that Tyler Durdens worldview is the message of Fight Club. Sure he has a lot going for him, but he essentially is the movies antagonist. ""Fight Club opened my eyes. Now I always beat myself up because nothing matters. We need to destroy all forms of capitalism. We need to suffer because we are worth nothing. We need to start smoking, and look cool like Tyler Durden"" (Obvious exaggeration)

But that's sometimes the feeling I get from some Fight Club fans. But I think that that's dangerous and by far not the right approach of interpreting Fight Club (*at least in my eyes*)

Tyler has a lot of clever points, ""The things that you own, end up owning you"" or ""We are a generation raised by women"".

The dependence on things, materialism and capitalism, the grey look of an office, the loop of never escaping a life routine you hate as well as the de-masculinization of modern society, are all interesting, and in some way true.

But this serves the purpose for Tyler, the **antagonist**, being the exact **opposite** of the narrator, our **protagonist.**

Our protagonist is flawed, he is unhappy, and he blames everything (sometimes reasonably, sometimes non reasonably) on everything around him. That's why he creates a fantasy, an alter ego, Nietzsche would say an ""Übermensch"". He creates an ideal of **himself.** But because he is flawed, his thinking is toxic, Tyler Durden, the best version of him, the man he is aspiring to be, is also **flawed** (obviously shown when he turns into full terrorist and fascist leader).

When Tyler Durden, is the ideal of you, then being Tyler Durden, **does not mean** smoking and destroying yourself (unless you in real life are just like Nortons narrator in the film), but to be what you truly want to be. Imagine a perfect version of yourself, and that's your personal Tyler Durden.

I think that's the main message of the movie.

Half of it is criticizing materialism, and how it can affect people in our society (leading to terrorism and fascism)

and the other half (your idolizing view on Tyler Durden) is telling you to embrace what you want to be, your charismatic, capable, and **personal** Tyler Durden.

8,"What are some of the best movie endings of this decade (2010-) ? A great movie is nothing without a great ending. 

But what are the best movie endings of this decade? Twisted, shocking, or just beautifully rounding up the movie.

Some of my picks:

\- Split (2016) David Dunn appearing made me lose my mind, such a fantastic moment.

\- The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017) This was some beautiful storytelling and an immense climax to never ending absurdness. 

\- Logan (2017) One of the most emotionally challenging comic book moments ever created

\- Blade Runner 2049 (2017) Ryan Gosling lying in the snow. Leave it at that

\- Shutter Island (2010) The twisted ending is practically infamous, and its what makes me want to rewatch it

What are some of your favorite movie endings of this decade?"
8,"Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) has some of the best action in recent years The movie is definitely at its best when it's doing action. Like most of the movies it's paying homage to Kingsman isn't without flaws. It certainly has pacing issues, has some okay narrative choices and spends a bit too much time in the ""training"" sequence. 

But when it does action, it does it really well. The scenes are comparably really brutal and violent, have graphic blood shed, innovative gadgets and fantastic camera work. I think the church scene was actually one big long take tracking shot, with so much going on and really great cinematography. But the gadgets, like amnesia shooting watches, or bulletproof umbrellas are really fun to watch. For the most part they also use some very fine supporting music, and Colin Firth elevates most of his action scenes with his presence.

What do you think about Kingsman: The Secret Service and its action scenes?"
8,"Movies that are elevated by a terrific third act? For me personally, Kingsman: The Secret Service.

For the most part it plays like a pretty predictable spy origin story. It has a lot of, essentially a bit overstretched training sequences, some pacing problems here and there but is pretty fun to watch.

But the third act, after/with the church fight scene is really terrific. The movie had some fine action before but the church massacre is so great, innovative in its violence, while also gorgeously shot, somehow really surprising and weird, but it all makes sense after the reveal. After that, Eggsy's ""revenge"" begins and the movie seriously nearly manages to go on a James Bond scale. The last act has great pacing, engaging music, some really violent action, but is also packed with a wonderful, quirky fun performance by Samuel L. Jackson and some emotional tension with Eggsys mum. 

What are some other movies that come to your mind when we're talking about a great third act?"
8,"Unbreakable is a movie truly ahead of its time. A grounded, and realistic, but still thought provoking attempt in presenting a ""super-hero"" M. Night Shyamalans ""Unbreakable"" is two things in one.

At first, it's about an everyday man struggling to find his place in the world and slowly discovering his uniqueness. On the other hand, it is about a man, who desperately wants to fight the exact opposite of his.

&#x200B;

Interesting to note is that the intentions of Samuel L Jacksons ""Mr Glass"" are never really clear at first glance. Is it his ego he's trying to fill while finding someone who is the precise opposite of his, or is he truly fascinated and obsessed with the idea of a ""super"" human.

&#x200B;

Shyamalans directing is near perfect. In the first hour he uses extremely long tracking shot takes, the first with Bruce Willis on the train is magnificent filmmaking. But he doesn't stop there. He uses different angles, through mirrors, or with 180 degree turns, slow close ups and so on to tell his story. The tone is grey-blue-ish, tired, one might say boring at times - exactly the tone to describe David Dunn's current state in life.

&#x200B;

The commentary it has on comic books, and in the idea of an absolute evil & good is presented in a very unique way. Especially considering todays obsession of comic book adaptations and the juggernaut franchises. Unbreakable takes a very grounded, realistic, but at times magical attempt in portraying a ""super-hero"".

&#x200B;

Some elements may be slow, some supporting characters and relations not fully fleshed out, or frustrating for viewers of action comic book movies, but this truly is a unique, bizarre approach.

But one with excellent filmmaking at its core, and two ingenious lead performances and intriguing characters.

What do you think about Unbreakable?
"
8,"What are the greatest movie moments when the villain and the hero finally meet? The moment everybody has been waiting for, when the hero and villain finally meet.
Some of my picks:
- James Bond & Sylva (SkyFall, 2012)
- James Bond & Trevelyan (GoldenEye, 1995)
- Luke Skywalker & Darth Vader (The Empire Strikes Back, 1980)
- John McClane & Hans Gruber (Die Hard, 1988)

But for me, undoubtedly the best is Vincent Hannah & Neil McConaghey from Heat (1995).
The basic premise of the movie was Pacino vs. DeNiro. And the first on screen appearance is everything one would expect. Sophisticated, detailed, nuanced and epic dialogue, totally unconventional for a hero/villain relationship.

What‘s your favourite moment when Hero & Villain meet? 

"
8,"Movie parodies that actually are better than the movie they are parodying? Hot Fuzz. That‘s not to say that the action genre itself isn‘t good, because hell, it is. But Hot Fuzz is so much better than the movies its making fun of, being Point Break & Bad Boys 2. It‘s just so superbly edited, every frame works, every reference to one of these movies is fantastic and perfectly written and it feels like it oozes out a certain coolness that nothing can match.

What are some of your picks for best movie parodies, better than the og movie?"
8,"I am so thrilled by Hot Fuzz (2007), what a fantastic way to start the year! I know this movie is popular and that there are many people loving it, but I never came around Edgar Wrights second entry of the Cornetto trilogy, despite considering Shaun of the Dead one of the all time great comedies. 

While it may or not reach the level of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz definitely earns its place in the greatest comedies in movie history. 

The editing is so perfect, never missing a beat, perfectly laying out humor, details and plot points. It feels so organic and nuanced, as is the script itself. The narrative is so smooth and cool, like you never really want this movie to end. Pegg & Frost are at their best, just like in SOTD, delivering one liners, physical comedy, pop culture references, or just plain mockery and parody. 

Timothy Dalton (who I've only ever seen in the James Bond movies 1987-89) is a fantastic villain and while the movie is (part)  a parody, the dark and violent moments definitely are horrifying. 

This is probably a movie that I'm gonna rematch a dozen of times until I discovered all the details, recurring themes, easter eggs and so on. And I'm so glad I started 2019 with such a wonderful movie.

What do you thin about Hot Fuzz?"
8,"Upgrade is seriously one of the years best movies, fairly overlooked! Considering it didn‘t even get a theatrical release in some countries (e.g. Germany) and I did not find it anywhere to buy on Blu Ray, I would say that Upgrade (2018) is for the most part one of the most overlooked movies of this year.

The movie is at it‘s best when we have Grey and Stem interacting in a way. It doesn‘t only provide some cool humour but explores an interesting „relationship“.
All the while delivering some, near pornographic violence in action scenes. The more I think about it, the more does it feel like this should‘ve been the case in Venom. The action at times feels „perfect“ in a way that is „not human“, precise and flawless. The stuff might be really gory, but it‘s engaging.

The movie also tricks the viewer by having **2 twists** , **Spoilers incoming**
The story plays out fairly predictable for the most part, when it‘s revealed that Eron actually was behind it, but then it‘s revealed that the Stem itself is actually the main villain. That was some serious shit and really great, especially considering the last few minutes. 
There were some plot points or scenes that I found quite clumsy or rushed in the beginning, but they totally made sense with the reveal and the context of the reveal in the end.

Please guys check out Upgrade, it‘s a top 10 of the year for me for sure and it‘s one of the most underrated movies.

8,"Yorgos Lanthimos' ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) is a nightmare that feels like a Franz Kafka novella brought to life! Anyone who has ever read literary work by Franz Kafka, be it the Metamorphosis, The Trial or some of his parables knows the feeling of complete powerlessness, like in a nightmare.

Yorgos Lanthimos captures the same feeling. He starts a situation, lets it get weird, and then makes the viewer feel so uncomfortable and distressed. And the he hunts the viewer from one haunting setting to another, while always increasing the stakes and the sense of evil/danger.

Some of the scenes are legitimately haunting to watch, and the slow & methodic camera, the dazzling and powerful soundtrack and the fantastic performances add up to an absurd and awful climax.

I can't really tell if this is a movie I hate or I love, but I got to respect Lanthimos for giving me one of the most unique, if perverse and horrifying movie experiences.

What do you think about this movie?"
8,"Shaun of the Dead (2004) is honestly one of the best comedies (or should I say horror movies?) I have ever seen! It's strange to fit Shaun of the Dead (Edgar Wright, 2004) in a genre. Of course it's funny, so it's a comedy. But it also has lots of zombies and tension, so it's a horror movie. But it actually has some really engaging character interactions and character moments, so it's a drama.

It's all of it and it's fucking brilliant!

Edgar Wright manages to mix the trivial and conventional with something so absurd and ridiculous and the result is nothing short of incredible.

The story is fairly conventional british drama in the first act, then it introduces the zombies and how our characters react to them and then it's a completely survival/massacre in the end.

The script is close to perfect. Every element or plot point or theme introduced in the beginning, somehow affects the later circumstances. Be it a catchphrase, a character relation, a place or even a video game instruction.

The performances are top notch, the humor works brilliantly, but even the characters feel so ""real"" and relatable.I could go on and on and talk about the one liners and all the ingenious moments but I'm just gonna stop and ask you, what do you think about Shaun of the Dead?

"
8,"Prisoners (2013) is one of the most f*cked-up movies I have seen. So, I just finished Denis Villeneuve's ""Prisoners"" from 2013 and must say that this was a really tough and gritty experience.

The movie is a slow burn, but it does not take long until it starts burning. Some of the stuff was completely fucked up. Like Hugh Jackmans character slowly torturing Paul Dano and when Viola Davis character finds out how messed up he really is. And then the stuff with the snakes and the pigs blood..and then the whole scary maze stuff. And just the over all topic of child abuse. It's so unsettling and uncomfortable at times.

The movie is incredibly scary. Not in a way like a horror movie, but scary in a way that you know people like this actually exist. The characters are forced into immoral situations, then ready to explode and unleash all the anger. It's so cleverly directed, and the performances especially by Gyllenhaal & Jackman are near perfect (but also every body else).

The last few scenes are suspenseful, and really engaging and this is definitely one of the best movies of 2013.

What do you think about Prisoners?"
8,"What‘s your experience for going alone to the cinema? I go quite often to the movies so I‘m obviously not always going in a group or with a partner. What‘s your general experience of going to the theaters alone? Do you feel that‘s normal or should someone always go at least as two?

Personally I think it‘s easier when deciding to watch a movie that, well only you want to see"
8,"What are some big budget movies with horrible CGI? Holy, that last fight scene of Black Panther v Killmonger looked like a playstation 2 game!

The movie itself had some good moments and great acting performances, but how can a movie this expensive cost look so bad visually?
I mean it had a budget of 200million + dollars.

Obviously there have been major blockbusters with bad CGI like Die Another Day, Harry Potter 1, The Mummy Returns, XMen Origins etc but BP came out in 2018, and the other MCU movies like Infinity War or Ragnarok have some really fitting and great VFX"
8,"It's ironic how Dunkirk goes completely without gore and graphic violence, and still happens to be one of the most distressing and claustrophobic war movies Finished Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk about two hours ago, after having sadly missed it last year in theaters (wow, that IMAX experience must've been special!) and I can't stop thinking about how claustrophobic and heavy some of the situations felt. I always thought of Christopher Nolan as a ""monumental"" filmmaker, creating epic scope, putting his characters into very unconventional situations and using some of his effective twisted storytelling. Yet the suspense and fear he transmitted in Dunkirk was something I had never seen him do before. The movie it self rarely has blood, some bloody faces but other than that there are no flying heads, or cut of legs, or rotting corpses etc. like in many other war movies.

What do you think about Dunkirk?"
8,"As the year closes out slowly, what have been your, lets say 5 favorite films of this year? (US Release) for me:

1. Hereditary (Ari Aster)
2. Roma (Alfonso Cuaron)
3. Mission Impossible 6: Fallout (Christopher McQuarrie)
4. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (Joel & Ethan Coen)
5. A Quiet Place (John Krasinski)

Hereditary was the movie I was so hyped to see and was the most disturbing thing I have ever seen in a theater. Honestly after finishing it, I never wanted to watch this terrifying thing ever again. Roma, was also much anticipated and did not disappoint. It was Alfonso Cuarons most personal and intimate movie, something truly special. Fallout is the definition of a summer blockbuster at its finest. Full of energy, speed, action and humor (though it may not be as impressive on the smaller screen). The Coens returned with the most unique film of the year and one that took me some thoughts to fully appreciate it.

A Quiet Place was also probably the most surprising movie of the year. Did not think that John Krasinski's debut film would be so good, but it had some fantastic sound design and incredible performances by Emily Blunt and the kids.

What are your top 5 of the year?"
8,"I was NOT emotionally ready for this! (Roma, 2018) Oh my.

I was lucky enough to catch a selected viewing in my area (Germany) to watch Alfonso Cuarons ""Roma"", which if I had missed it, I would have had to wait until next week to only see it on the small screen. But this experience DESERVES the big screen!

Let me start by saying that I'm white straight male European, so technically, I have nothing in common, relatable with the female lead in this movie. Yet, I rarely ever felt so attached to a movie character than in this movie.

On a technical stand point this movie is as great as it can get. Directing, editing, cinematography, locations, setting, sound design, color grading & performances were simply put perfect. How Cuaron lovely moves his camera, takes his time for those wonderful long-takes and transforms you into 1970 Mexiko is absolutely astonishing.

I won't spoil anything, but Roma is as personal as a movie can get. There are 2 scenes in particular that are gut wrenching and heartbreaking, yet directed with such a love and passion for details and film.

I beg you, you can not miss this one in theaters!"
8,"What's the greatest movie you'll never watch twice? Children of Men, for me.

Cuaron does such an incredible (like, REALLY incredible) job in dystopian world building. It's nuanced, thought provoking, detailed and scary. The movie also features some stunning cinematography and directing. Other than that, the performances are all very solid and convincing. Plus, that damn car long take is near perfection.

But I really don't know if I'm ever gonna watch this movie again. At times, it just feels joyless and depressing, sometimes even frustrating. The plot itself isn't really that engaging, though some scenes definitely ARE captivating. Empty isn't the right word, I really didn't get much enjoyment out of many parts of it in the end.

&#x200B;

What are some of your favorite movies, that you'll never watch twice?"
8,"The Nice Guys (2016) is a really great crime/neo-noir comedy! I feel like its not getting the appreciation it should. So, I just finished Shane Black's ""The Nice Guys"" (2016) and I have to say that it really was a great movie.

Whoever thought to team up Russel Crowe & Ryan Gosling in a buddy cop/detective comedy is a genius. Like, really. From those two leading actors I've only seen dramatic roles (Goslings best for me in BR49 & Crowe undeniably in Gladiator) but they perfectly delivered the comedic stuff.

I loved the obvious reference and influence that was the Coen's ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998), which happens to be one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie moves at its own speed, has some really memorable dialogue and well written and funny humor. The storyline itself is also interesting and takes a lot of really suspenseful turns towards the third act.

The only stuff I didn't completely like was the ""Be a good person and don't kill this guys"" relationship between Holly & Jackson, felt kinda off and the last scene with Kim Basinger felt a bit unnecessary.

But other than that I had a lot of fun with this movie and I think I'm definitely gonna revisit it some day.

What do you think about it?"
8,"The Departed (2005) is a picture perfect movie! Though I really like the r/movies sub, I think it's kinda difficult to get into discussions for movies that haven't had their theatrical release currently (1-2 years ago), specifically avoiding the term ""older movies"" since I wouldn't call any 21. century movie particularly old. But I just watched Scorsese's ""The Departed"" for the first time and have to share my experience.

First of all let me say that Scorsese is one of my favorite directors (and I still don't know why I never watched The Departed) and GoodFellas (1990) is arguably my favorite movie of all time.

While The Departed has many similarities with GoodFellas - the voice over, the ensemble cast of important characters, the mafia/mob thematic, and basic themes of greed and betrayal - it quickly evolves into something new. It is one of the most intense and suspenseful movies I have ever seen. Like literally, there is a scene where a phone rings, and it's the most intense scene ever.

It's so layered and complex that it even is hard to follow sometimes, who can play the cat/mouse (or should I say rat) game better? And then when it settles and moves at its own speed to follow the unconventional narrative and storytelling, it escalates into a few quick kills in the end. See, it doesn't grab someone emotionally and that's quite unique. The escalation is logical consequence from the sense of urgency created over the whole movie. It's brilliant captured in the final shot.

Other than that, typical Scorsese - cast delivers (abso-fuckin-loutely), great soundtrack, great imagery and over all really memorable dialogue.

What do you think about The Departed?"
8,"What an absolutely unforgettable experience! Blade Runner 2049 is one of my favorite movies ever! Wow, just wow. After finishing Blade Runner 2049 I was speechless.

A couple of days ago I posted about [Arrival](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9z7e4n/arrival_2016_is_so_damn_fantastic_what_a/) (Denis Villeneuve, 2016) and how thought provoking and fantastically made I found it and most in the comment section recommended me Blade Runner 2049, which I bought on Blu Ray some days ago.

I have to be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of Ridley Scotts original (though I have only seen it once), but this sequel is everything I could have ever dreamed of. 

It's so sharply constructed, awe inspiring, and unforgettable. It's probably the best looking movie I have ever seen. Some of the art design and cinematography is beyond my wildest imagination. Every movement and every shot is created with so much love for the detail, everything happens in a moving, slowly, but still moving rhythm that takes all its time to fully create atmosphere and a certain sense depending on the scene - emotion, suspense, danger etc. 

Also remarkable is the brilliant sound design. I'm glad I watched on Blu Ray and didn't stream on a laptop, because there's so much detail in the sound, unbelievable. And then, sometimes these ostentatious, grandiose tonal sounds when introducing a new setting, location.

The performances are top notch, especially by Gosling who I think has the potential to become an all time great actor, and the basic theme; What it is to be human; is truly thought provoking. BR49 doesn't focus much on action, but when it does it's fantastically executed. The movie is also filled with some really clever twists and obviously, there is so much room for interpretation (so much, a reddit post can't even cover up so I'm not trying).

After everything I've mentioned, BR49 emerged as one of my favorite movies of the decade, but maybe even of all time!

What do you think about Blade Runner 2049?"
8,"Arrival (2016) is so damn fantastic! What a mind-blowing experience! Wow, I just finished Denis Villeneuve's Arrival a couple of hours ago and am still stunned.

While watching I thought it was a really well made, fabulously looking and great acted sci-fi movie with a great and intelligent premise, but it kinda lacked something to elevate it for me. And then the twist happened, and from there the movie just became better and better and went to complete mind blowing stuff I have never thought of. 

While my initial thought what the movies main center's about was ""How do you react to extraterrestrials?"", it became clear that the main question was something way more human and philosophical ""If you could see your whole life from start to finish, would you change things?"" That whole stuff with the time not being linear is something that has fascinated me my entire life and I never thought it could be used so well in a film. Deep down, it's something we can't understand, maybe we can't even imagine it.

I have to check Denis Villeneuve's other stuff (only watched Sicario before and bought BR49 on Blu-Ray because I've loved his work so far.

As for Arrival, it's in the end a gut wrenching, but also heart warming experience. One thing for sure, it's a movie I'm gonna think about a long time."
8,"Outlaw King, David Mackenzies new movie, features some really great action scenes! So first of all, spoilers, for everyone who hasn‘t seen Outlaw King (started about a week ago on Netflix).

I thought the movie was really good, borderline great, which I didn‘t thought judging from the comparably poor reception by critics.

The thing that made it stand out for me was the action.

There are about 3 action scenes, the ambush in the forrest (which I thought was really well made), the battle near in the lake/river and of course the final battle of Bannockburn.

I really got some Battle of the Bastards vibes out of the last battle. It had some real threat of danger, chaos and claustrophobia to it. Also some really innovative stuff with the pikes and the horses.

Obviously it was bloody as fuck and got really epic in the end. When Robert defeated the Prince and let him run away, or when the young boy died in his arms and gave him the crown.

There was a lot of attention to detail and violence, which I thought helped elevate the stakes of the storyline.

What do you think about Outlaw King and especially its action?"
8,"The script of ""Back To The Future"" is (close to) perfect Yes, I have never watched Back to the Future. But today I finally sat down and watched the blu ray.

My first thoughts were; This is just a great movie.

Like, not great as its thoroughly thought provoking, extremely remarkable in cinematography or has Oscar caliber performances. This is just a great movie. An endlessly watchable, fun and fully entertaining adventure movie that is up there with the likes of Indiana Jones 1&3 and the first PoTC as my favorite adventure movie.

Most of it goes back to the script. It's so flawless. Like every plot point follows another, every scene demands the upcoming scene. Any line of dialogue, or remarkable element introduced in the beginning has impact on whats to come. It even feels like a coincidence that everything makes just perfect sense. 

And in the end, I just felt extremely happy after watching it.

What do you think about Back to The Future?"
8,"7 Psychopaths is really a great movie I‘ll say this, Martin McDonagh is probably the most consistent director I know. Okay, he has only directed 3 major movies, but In Bruges (2008) is one of my favorite movies ever and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri (2017) is one of my favourite movies of the decade. 

And Now I finally watched 7 Psychopaths and again, this is such a great movie.
I feel like having such an ensemble of talented actors really gives this movie something.
What I found remarkable is that I laughed so much, but it never reached the point where it was just comedy. It had some dark underlying themes, and some real moments of tension or at least danger.

Though not as though provoking and emotional as Three Billboards and not as funny as In Bruges I think 7 Psychos is a really great film by McDonagh, of whom I really want to see more.

8,"The more I think about it, the funnier does Martin McDonaghs ""In Bruges"" get ""Would you ever think about killing yourself because you're a midget?""

That's truly one of the funniest movie lines I have ever heard (especially in the context and the response), but the thing is, the whole movie is full of them.

It's such a wonderfully written, ingeniously funny movie with terrific performances and interesting themes.

What do you think about In Bruges?"
8,"Why is there no movie about the Greek Genocide? Today I searched for a movie that deals with the Pontian Greek Genocide by the Turks that reached it's climax in the years 1916-1923 (so not counting the Ottoman oppression of the centuries before) and ended with about 500.000 greek civilians, children and women slaughtered in many systematic massacres.

But, this is not a history but a movie sub ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek\_genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_genocide) , here's the basic source), so I wanted to ask why there never has been any (not even major) movie made about that topic. I know that there was a movie ""The Promise"" about the Armenian Genocide 2/3 years ago that was kinda boycotted.

Most of the War movies are either Vietnam or WW2/Holocaust movies and I can understand why; Vietnam being one of the biggest historical points in american history (and well Hollywood is American) and that many influential people (producers, directors, actors) in Hollywood are jewish.

Still, I can't really believe that there hasn't been a movie about such a topic and still has been buried in history more or less"
8,"Do you think there's a difference between ""favorite"" and ""best"" movies? Today I sat back and thought what my favorite movies of all time were, in order to make a letterbox list and I kinda tricked.

Is there a difference between favorite and best movies? Best, in terms of how you view them in quality, not best in terms of how good the critics rated them.

Like, some movies I have watched I found to be excellent, really fantastic in their technique, story, execution.. just over all. But I wouldn't count them as my favorite movies in lets say rewatchability. Some of the movies I would consider the best are Citizen Kane, Apocalypse Now and Raging Bull.

And on the other hand some movies I wouldn't directly consider to be the best, but are some of my favorites are In Bruges, Fargo, Die Hard, Casino Royale

Of course there are still my favorite movies, that I would also consider some of the best like Goodfellas, Shawshank, LOTR, The Godfather, The Big Lebowski, The Dark Knight, The Good Bad & Ugly, Psycho, Chinatown.

&#x200B;

It's tough for me to really draw a line there.

What about you, is there a difference between your favorite movies, and the movies you think are the best ?"
8,"What do you think of True Grit, The Coen Brothers Western from 2010? Finished watching True Grit a couple of hours ago. I‘m a huge fan of Joel & Ethan Coens work - The Big Lebowski is my 4th favourite movie ever and No Country For Old Men & Fargo are up there with my favourites - but I never really stumbled across True Grit.

In the beginning I thought that the story it was about to tell, and eventually told was a bit conventional (?). 
Don‘t get me wrong, but a Western revenge story is something I have definitely seen before. 
With some great shots and great performances of all the cast the movie played out its strengths.
Still, I though that the over all structure and characters didn‘t feel „Coen-ish“.
Except for the last third, which had the beautiful Coen randomness in it. The last minutes were really great, in my opinion. Delivering not only satisfying but also kinda emotional conclusions.

What‘s your take on True Grit? 
"
8,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of the best blockbusters ever So, obviously there is a lot, A LOT of nostalgia in this, but I just love Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl so damn much.

It has one of the best movie soundtracks ever (imo), even the piano tutorial medley sums up all leading leitmotifs perfectly ( [https://youtu.be/YE9cxYd27Jw](https://youtu.be/YE9cxYd27Jw) ), that is catchy and sometimes even clever, but always fitting.

It has one of the most charismatic lead performances by Johnny Depp, it has great supporting actors like Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley or Geoffrey Rush all portraying kinda unique characters.

But I think the key element is, that it has a plausible story, that firstly doesn't twist itself too much, but also doesn't take it self too seriously. Yet everything makes sense in the films context, nearly all plot points make sense and there is some real mystery and tension in the end. 

All of that delivered with great visual effects, some really good choreographed action and lots of humor make for one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen. It may not be a technical masterpiece and milestone achievement in movie history, but it is damn sure one of my favorites and a really great nostalgic movie.

&#x200B;

What do you think about PoTC 1: The Curse of the Black Pearl"
8,"In Bruges is such a fantastic comedy Earlier this year I got to see Three Billboards in theaters and was absolutely stunned by it. So I decided to take a closer look at Martin McDonaghs work and bought the In Bruges Blu Ray and oh my god. I can't remember any movie that made me laugh so much as this one. Maybe Deadpool 2 or 21 Jump Street, but they use a completely different sense of humor.

It's a tightly written movie with amazing lead performances, real tension sometimes, and so many laugh out loud scenes.

Like there is so much quotable dialogue: 

""What's Belgium famous for? Chocolates and child abuse; and they only invented chocolates to get to the kids."" 

""You're an inanimate fuckin' object! ""

""What exactly am I trying to say? You's a bunch of fuckin' elephants.""

""I mean basically if you're robbing a man and you're only carrying blanks and you allow your gun to be taken off you and you allow yourself to be shot in the eye with a blank which I assume that the person has to get quite close to you then, yeah really it's all your fault for being such a poof, so why don't you stop wingeing and cheer the fuck up.""

&#x200B;

And so much more; My favorite part is actually where Ray and the midget talk about the upcoming war between the blacks and the whites and where people like Pakistanis or Vietnames stand.

I know this kind of humor isn't for everyone, but it's definitely my cup of tea. What do you think about In Bruges?"
8,"Edge of Tomorrow is such a brilliant movie Finally got around watching my Edge of Tomorrow Blu Ray, and holy heck?! Why haven‘t I seen this stuff before? 

This is a really fantastic action/Sci-fi film that is completely original, has some really intense action and suspense and two very charismatic lead performances by Emily Blunt and of course Tom Cruise.

I think the storyline in its heart is actually really great, since it  has a lot of mystique but also plausibility in it. Now I‘m not saying that an alien invasion is plausible, but it all makes sense in context to the film.

All of this leads to gripping action scenes with great alien/monster creatures and a great pay-off. Personally I even felt a bit emotional in the end.

What do you think about Edge of Tomorrow?"
8,"Anyone else completely bursts into tears in the ending sequences of LOTR: The Return of the King for about half an hour? I'm literally shaken.

I don't know what to say.

The Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of The Ring is probably my second favorite movie of all time and has the biggest Punch-In-The-Gut Moment of any film ever (Boromir Last Stand), and The Battle of Helms Deep in Two Towers is my favorite battle ever put on screen. And so, The Return of the King has probably the best ending sequence of any film I have ever watched.

When tears count as a factor for greatness, then nothing really compares with this one. I have never bursted into tears for so long, and again, and again, and another scene that made me cry, and another beautiful music that made me cry.

It's like the Series transforms you into Middle Earth, you are part of these beloved characters for so much time (like 12 hours in the Extended Cut), and then you see everything conclude in such a beautiful, but even melancholically heartbreaking way.

Yes, this is a goodbye. It's over.

Possibly the Greatest Film Series of all time.

I hope I'm not the only one who cried during the whole ending montages, anyone else?"
8,"Celebrate 20 Years of THE BIG LEBOWSKI: What is your favorite scene of this movie? This Saturday I am attending a movie festival to celebrate 20 years of The Big Lebowski (seeing it Open Air). 

The 1998 released Coen Brothers flick was initially a box office flop, but it has earned cult status over the years and is one of my favorite movies ever.

Creating arguably the coolest movie character of all time, some of the most quotable dialogue of all time and arguably the most rewatchable movie period (though Scorcese's GoodFellas might have a talk to that).

My favorite scene is when Walter tries to interrogate the 14 year old boy for the stolen (?) money and then goes outside to destroy his 1985 Corvette, which turns out to be the neighbors car.  
Rarely have I ever laughed so much in a movie scene.

&#x200B;

What is your favorite scene from The Big Lebowski?"
8,"What's the saddest and most touching Movie Death? There are so many iconic, moving, and sad movie deaths that make the viewer cry.

For me, Boromir - The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring

This is one of my favorite movie moments of all time.  
Boromir, acting as a strong link of the Fellowship gets seduced by the ring and wants to rip it from Frodo who escapes.  
When realizing that, he desperately fights all of the Orks. With so much pathos, anger he fights until he gets shot by an arrow.

What follows is one of the most iconic movie lines ever; While talking to Aragorn:

""I would have followed you my brother... my captain... my king""

It gets me every single time.

I have only cried three times at a movie until now, and this scene is one of these occasions. 

Okay, what is in your opinion the most moving, saddest movie death?"
8,"If there is one thing I want to see in Bond 25, it's Bond not going rogue. That doesn't mean that ""Bond goes Rogue"" movies can't be good or entertaining, I mean License To Kill is a very good Bond movie, and SkyFall is one of the best. But I feel like this concept has been used way too often lately. SPECTRE was basically Bond going rogue, Skyfall also, Quantum Of Solace is pretty much the definition of a Vendetta Story and even Casino Royale turned out to be no ""normal"" mission. And even most of the Brosnan movies weren't ""normal"" missions. GoldenEye sees Bond going up against the Russians to avenge Alec (though he becomes the villain), The World is Not Enough sees himself and M get trapped by a woman he thought he could trust and DAD is completely ridiculous.

Out of the last 10 Bond movies, the only ones where there was a normal mission, were Tomorrow Never Dies & The Living Daylights.

For Bond 25 I just want a conventional Bond. And that doesn't mean a boring and generic Bond. But I think Bond 25 should be the most formular-ish Bond movie. Bond gets his mission from M and some gadgets from Q, hunts down an organization, gets captured by the main villain, who then explains the whole diabolic plan to bond, then Bond frees himself and kills everyone, getting of with the girl.

I mean, well.

What do you think about Bond 25?




EDIT:
Just to get it clear; I definitely do not hate the (newer)/Craig movies: CR is my favourite Bond and SF Top 5. "
8,"Anyone else thinks that Johnny English 1 & 2 are really entertaining movies and is hyped for Johnny English Strikes Again this year? Both Johnny English movies (2003 original, 2011 reborn) aren't the most popular movies, neither critically acclaimed. With both of them being ""rotten"" on MetaCritic and Rottentomatoes. And even the audience reviews were maximum ""okay"".

But, who cares about that stuff?  
I absolutely love both Johnny English movies and I'm proud of that.

The first Johnny English movie has a swift plot, a very great character introduction, some seriously completely hilarious jokes and scenes (with Bough on the grave yard, or the man with banana scars), a really (like REALLY) cool car chase and an enjoyable finale.

The second Johnny English movie has some very cool gadgets and feels very stylish. I actually found the plot (when I first watched it like 7 years ago) really entertaining and even compelling. In my opinion this movie has one of the best casts in recent years with Dominic West, Gillian Anderson, Daniel Kaluya, Rosamund Pike & of course Rowan Atkinson, and it also has some really hilarious jokes (the drug impact scene, the Shushan/Susan scene in the airplane).

But in general, I feel like both movies have a very nice balance. They have enough jokes to keep you laughing, but keep the plot serious enough, so that it's compelling and you can follow the story.

I also feel that they have some really nice storytelling in connecting their story (the japanese grandma stuff in JE2), and actually some pretty ""emotional"" moments (like Johnny being frustrated in JE1, or the resolution with Johnny kissing Kate in JE2).

And well, if there's ever anyone that works better than Rowan Atkinson at physical comedy I'm not aware of him.

At the end of the day, maybe both movies are generic and cheesy spy spoofs, but I still love them.

The third one has a returning Bough (though I would love to see a cameo from Rosamund Pike or Daniel Kaluya) and another Bond Girl in Olga Kurylenko (Quantum of Solace).

After Fallout, Infinity War & A Quiet Place this is probably the most I have been hyped for a movie this year."
8,"What's a movie that feels great when you watch it, but falls apart after you start deconstructing and thinking about it? For me, The Dark Knight Rises.

I have goosebumps while watching some of the scenes. Like Batman's first appearance or the Batman v/ Bane brawl, or even the absolutely stunning pre title sequence with the plane hijack. 

And even the ending feels really great and impactful, because Nolan's storytelling ties the beginning with the end.

But if you really start deconstructing the movie it falls apart.

I think it's the one time where Nolan was just too ambitious in telling his story (like in The Prestige, though it worked there better).

\[SPOILER\]

The Talia reveal just does not work, Bane's death is so disappointing for a character like him, Catwoman's motivations never really embrace, the stupid cops running against guys with guns, the whole giant bomb plot...

It has so many powerful scenes, but it's great peaces, with bad pieces, that don't work together.

What's a movie FOR YOU that feels great when you watch it but falls apart after you start deconstructing and thinking about it?"
8,"Anyone else feels that ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015) is the most Tarantino-ish movie since his debut movies? Recently I re-watched Tarantino's Hateful Eight. A movie I loved when it came out 3 (?) years ago. It was the first Quentin Tarantino movie I ever saw, and it made me want to watch all of this mans work and now he is one of my favorite directors ever. 

I realized that there is some sort of ""backlash"" and criticism for the Hateful Eight since it is widely considered Tarantino's ""worst"" movie. 'Too many unnecessary dialogues, too much non-sense, too much blood' - but that's exactly what I love about the film. It reminded me so much of ""Reservoir Dogs"" (Tarantino's debut): All taking place in one big mysterious room; strangers coming together not trusting each other, some sort of betrayal happening, a lot of guy talk, a big amount of blood. The parallels are fascinating. 

For me ""The HateFul Eight"" feels like the most Tarantino-ish movie, a movie he wanted to make 20 years ago but did not have the budget or studio acceptance. And yes, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction may have a tighter script, but they haven't got the beautiful cinematography of The Hateful Eight. Combining the fantastic cinematography with a soundtrack of legendary Ennio Morricone (the guy who created my all time favorite movie soundtrack, well one of my all-time favorites) and you have a picture perfect setting and music. 

Tarantino's newer movies have been comparably ""strong"" on plot, they are more focussed on telling the main story; Django Unchained or Inglorious Basterds. But The Hateful Eight feels like a throwback to Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs where, well the plot of course matters, but you don't necessarily watch it for the suspense. You watch it for the pure fun, for all the blood, all the violence, all the sex jokes and quotable dialogue."
8,"Anyone else feels that Insidious 1-3 is actually a pretty solid and good horror trilogy? Before Insidious The Last Key came out this January (which ended up disappointing for me) I rematched the three Insidious movies and really think they are good James Wan horror movies. The first one is a very scary movie that has some legitimate shockers (though the story has some holes in it). The second one isn't as scary as the first one, but it's actually really interesting. The story with The Bride isn't extremely original or stuff, but it's well explained and makes sense. Even the third movie has some cool stuff in it (except for the bad resolution), with the handicapped girl being trapped by the demon.

What do you think about the 3 Insidious movies?"
8,"Seeing how MCU fans are desperately waiting for Avengers 4; I'm asking myself how did people wait for Return of The Jedi? After Avengers Infinity War hit theaters this April, being one of the biggest and most successful movies of all time, many fans were shocked at how the movie turned out. It did not only end on a cliffhanger, but also with the villain Thanos seemingly winning for the first time. 

I have seen people desperately waiting for Avenges 4 next year to finally end the Infinity War story and answer their question.

But I'm asking myself: How did Star Wars fans wait for Return of the Jedi in 1980/83?

I mean at the end of the day, the cliffhanger of Empire (1980) was way bigger, more shocking and unpredictable than the one in Infinity War. Plus, the gap between both Avengers movies is only 1 year, while SW was 3 whole years. In addition to that the MCU is even dropping two movies between both Avengers movies that more or less also have some impact on Avengers 4. And with all social media today, the answer to all movies is way easier to get than let's say in 1981.

Anyone watching movies in the 80s, how was it to wait after Empire?"
8,"GoodFellas, one of the most rewatchable and enjoyable movies ever made. In one word: Perfection It needs to be said. Every frame, every voice of over, every shot. It all just comes down at the right moment, perfectly timed. Martin Scorcese‘s adaptation of Nicolas Pillegi‘s novel „Wiseguy“ is one of the finest movies ever created. 

On a technical stand point, GoodFellas is just as perfect as any movie is ever going to get. And as for storytelling, it‘s a love letter to movie fans, wanting to see the fall and rise of a man. Just like Charles Foster Kane, or Jake La Motta or Daniel Plainview, the brilliant story of the rise and fall of Henry Hill is captivating, identifiable, reachable, yet somehow so far away and extraneous. 

But for a movie to be one of my all time favourite movies, it has to be more than that. It does not have to be a perfect movie on a technical or story level. It has to be truly enjoyable. And GoodFellas is the second most rewatchable movie I have ever seen.

GoodFellas gets often compared to The Godfather, and while I think that on an objective comparison no movie except Citizen Kane can outclass The Godfather, I always found GoodFellas to be the more enjoyable piece of art. That‘s not saying The Godfather isn‘t enjoyable - it‘s in my personal top 10. It‘s a masterpiece that simultaneously kicks ass - but for every iconic scene of The Godfather, there is an even more enjoyable scene in GoodFellas

Just listing it up:
- The Opening „As far back as I can remember“
- The mob threatening the mailman
- The brilliant „Funny How“ Scene
- The Whacking of Billy Batts
- The three eating with Tommy‘s mother
- The Long Take with Henry introducing Karen
- The Whacking of Tommy
- The Final Line

And so on.


What do you think about GoodFellas?"
8,"PTA's ""The Master"" is one of the weirdest, but also brilliant movies I have ever seen Yesterday I finally got around watching Paul Thomas Anderson's ""The Master"" from 2012, and wow. What an experience this was. It's hard to describe the viewing experience. It was like I was watching something that I had never seen before, in all different ways. I have seen movies with a subjective and unreliable narration like Shutter Island or Memento; I have seen movies with ambiguous plot points like No Country for Old Men; and I have seen some other (unconventional) Paul Thomas Anderson movies like There Will be Blood or Phantom Thread. But never have I seen all these elements combined in one movie. 

Hands down, Joaquin Phoenix's performance is one of the greatest, if not the greatest actor performance I have ever seen. And the conversation scene is hands down one of the best movie scenes I have ever seen.

Still, I was left kind of confused. I know that there are movies that you have to watch many times to understand, but I still thought that something was kind of missing. I did not completely get the catharsis, and when the screen fades to black and ""The Master"" appears, I did not know how to feel.

What do you think about Paul Thomas Andersons The Master?"
8,"The Fellowship of The Ring (2001) has not only one but two of the greatest punch-in-the-gut moments in cinema history I rewatched one of my all time favourite movies: The Lord of The Rings The Fellowship of the Ring. And again, I cried. Not once but twice. 

It‘s not often that movies make me cry, and even rarer if I rewatch them. As of right now I really can only think of Gladiator and The Shawshank Redemption that have made me cry as Fellowship.

[Spoilers]
Gandalfs death in the cave, and the Fellowships reaction outside is one of the most challenging scenes in all of movies for me.
But the real heartbreaker is Boromir‘s death. I know that Sean Bean can die in some great and awesome fashion (GoldenEye or Game of Thrones) but this one takes the crown. 

„I would have followed you everywhere, my brother, my captain, my king“ 

It‘s tragic, yet beautiful and I get goosebumps only thinking about it.


What do you think about The Fellowship of The Ring?"
8,"[Discussion] What‘s Martin Scorcese‘s Best Motion Picture? He is one of the best movie directors of all time and a legend in cinema history. Martin Scorcese has directed a lot of movies, many great ones, but what‘s his best?

That‘s a very tough question for me. 

The most thought provoking is definitely Taxi Driver. It‘s essentially a movie about loneliness, with a powerful Robert DeNiro performance.

The most gripping and compelling is Shutter Island for me. A stone-cold, twisted and dark thriller, one of the best in its genre with one of the best plot points ever.

The most enjoyable and rewatchable movie is definitely GoodFellas. It may be the simple most rewatchable movie ever made (The Big Lebowski rivals), and that‘s to fantastic all round performances, a tight script and fantastic visual storytelling.


But if I had to break it down, to what‘s simply his BEST movie, it has to be Raging Bull. For simple technique in filmmaking, it‘s an exercise in everything. Character study, camera work, story telling... It‘s one of those rare movies (like Citizen Kane, The Godfather, maybe Vertigo or No Country for Old Men) that is as close to perfect as any movie is ever gonna get


What‘s in YOUR OPINION Martin Scorceses best picture?"
8,"Appreciation thread: Finally got around watching Gladiator - one of the most powerful, breathtaking and emotional movies I have ever watched After so much time with the Gladiator Blu Ray lying some where in my room, I picked myself up and watched it. 
What Ridley Scott created with this movie is an epic in every sense of the word, and one of the most breathtaking movies of all time.
The pure dynamics of the characters, the visual storytelling and details (the hand.. the goddamn hand), the action scenes and the ending, it all comes down perfectly.
In the end, it‘s one of the most challenging scenes I have ever watched. Nearly no movie has made me cry - only The Shawshank Redemption, The Pianist, The Fellowship of The Ring - and this is one of them.

I have compared it to two other movies of the 2000s that I absolutely loved: There Will be Blood & No Country for Old Men.
While I would agree that in terms of storytelling or directing, maybe in terms of pure character study or visual interpretation these movies are better than Gladiator, Gladiator is one of the few movies that manages to touch your heart.

8,"Style over Substance: Which movie comes to your mind The Revenant for me.
The cinematography is beautiful. 
And not the „beautiful“ but the real beautiful. It‘s one of the finest shot films I have ever seen. It‘s so amazingly shot that It seems like a documentary about the beauty of nature.
It also features an incredible acting performance by Leo.

The story itself, you know, is very basic. It‘s not bad but it‘s basically a slow revenge story that is far stretched.
It never really gets emotional or fantastically suspenseful.


What are the movies that come to your mind?"
8,"Creed (2015) may not be the most original or unpredictable movie to come around, but it‘s a love letter to movie fans Just finished watching Ryan Cooglers „Creed“ for the second time.
I didn‘t think it would hold up as well as when I watched it the first time in 2015, but it did.

The story itself isn‘t original (it‘s very similar to Rocky‘s story) and yes, the movie is predictable if you really boil it down.
But I think this movie is a love letter to movie fans. It‘s a reminder of how cinema can make us feel with characters, of how touching a simple story, or even some images can be.

Rocky, with cancer, looking out of the window with Adonis running side by side with motorcycles, Adonis stepping up for the last round, everybody chanting his name after he survived the fight.

It‘s amazing how Coogler wraps things up yet still leaves some trademark references and humour in it („I‘m gonna make you an offer you can‘t refuse“).

What did you think about Creed?"
8,"Movies way more humorous than the Trailer would indicate? For me it‘s gotta be Infinity War.
The Trailers are extremely dark, brutal, nearly apocalyptic, but so damn epic.

Infinity War itself, of course had some amazing goosebump moments and sure was dark, but the first half had so many jokes in it.
I know that people really appreciate comic relief, and I do when it‘s done right (Guardians, Civil War), and here, it wasn‘t bad. It just wasn‘t what I expected.

It‘s similar to what I expected TDKR to be: An all time great action thriller with a breathless and demonic sense of chaos - like TDK.
But TDKR was a complete different movie.

Both trailers for Infinity War are among the best trailers of all time (in my opinion), but I think they don‘t really show the movie as it actually is.


What are other movies you can think of, that are way more humorous than the Trailer would indicate? "

Mr. Pink: Nah, I don't believe in it. 

Nice Guy Eddie: You don't believe in tipping?

Nice Guy Eddie: I don't even know a fucking Jew who'd have the balls to say that. Let me get this straight: you don't ever tip? 

Mr. Pink: I don't tip because society says I have to. All right, if someone deserves a tip, if they really put forth an effort, I'll give them something a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, it's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doing their job. 

Mr. Blue: Hey, our girl was nice.

8,"People who enjoyed Reservoir Dogs more than Pulp Fiction? I just don‘t really know which movie I prefer.
Maybe it‘s because I went into Pulp Fiction with maximum expectations the first time I watched it and felt kind off.. meh.
Of course the movie has grown on me as I watched it multiple times. It‘s a joy to watch the dozens of iconic moments, but I think I enjoyed Reservoir Dogs more.

Maybe that‘s because I went into Reservoir Dogs with no expectations, just on a normal Saturday morning. 
I think I liked it more because it actually had a „plot“. That doesn‘t mean Pulp Fiction is bad because it has no plot, of course not.


Anyone else enjoyed Reservoir Dogs more than Pulp Fiction?"
8,"Great movies that you would never watch twice? What are some great movies that you would never watch twice. Maybe because they are heartbreaking, depressing, terrifying and so on.

I think this applies to many war movies or movies that deal with war, like Schindler‘s List.

For me, it‘s Hereditary (2018). 
I finished watching it today and thought it was great. But I just wanted to leave the theater. I did not know what to do. It was terrifying horror, horror that sinks in your claw, that makes you want to scream - not because of the jump scare, but because of the emotion.
But it was also so disgusting and creepy.
I would never watch this movie again.

What else are movies that get reduced by the audience and labeled as something?

8,"Watching Terminator 2. I think this would have been the perfect end for the franchise. After I finished watching T2 yesterday I think it should have been the ending to what has now become a franchise.
The movie itself - magic. It uses phenomenal special effects, it is extremely powerful, smart, intelligent, even charmingly funny and of course action driven.
Although I don‘t think it‘s a perfect movie (the inner conflict of Sarah Connor didn‘t really interest me), I think it‘s definitely one of the best action films of all time. 

The ending itself is nearly heartbreaking, but also well written and makes sense.
Why wasn‘t this the ending of the series? It‘s so perfect "
8,"The best superheros are the ones who aren‘t entirely willing to bear the burden of simply being a superhero I‘ve thought about this for quite some time.
What makes a superhero (movie) great?

„Now this is what a superhero movie should be. [...] It's simply and poignantly a realization that being Spider-Man is a burden that Peter Parker is not entirely willing to bear.“
~ Roger Ebert on Spider-Man 2

And after reading this, I think it‘s exactly the formula for making a superhero great.
As I watched Age of Ultron, I had a strange feeling. The feeling that for the superheros, defending the universe/world is a job. It is work, grunt work. And it seemed extremely boring.

The best superhero movies are the ones where the superhero isn‘t sure if he can handle the burden of being this superhero.
Spider-Man 2 (as mentioned earlier) is a great example

The Dark Knight also is a prime example. Being Batman is a burden for Bruce Wayne, simply because it‘s restricting him and because it brings him to difficult situations.

The best example in the MCU may be Spider-Man Homecoming (Spidey movies seem to be good in that regard) but I also think Captain America 2&3 do that.

Captain America is a soldier that should do everything for the nation, but it‘s the dilemma of being assigned to a job that would instruct you to fight your best friend -> The Winter Soldier.

8,"What are the most important movies of The 1960s? So what are the most important, influential or memorable movies of the 1960s? 

I'm not talking about simply the best movies of the decade but about the most important.

For me, in NO particular order:  


\- Dr. No (started arguably the biggest franchise of all time)

\- 2001: A Space Odyssey (has become the quint essential Sci\-Fi Film ever)

\- Psycho (rule breaking in every sense)

\- Dollars Trilogy (redefined the Western genre, created the Spaghetti western and made Eastwood a quintessential actor)

Any more?"
8,"What‘s the best directorial debut of any director? I have thought about this for quite some time.
Even the greatest directors start somewhere, and in most cases don‘t deliver their finest work in their first movie, but rather improve on it.

So, what are the best directorial debuts of any director. Like when a director directly hits a movie out of nowhere and it becomes a classic or a great movie?"
8,"Appreciation Thread: After I finally finished watching Memento (2000), I must say that I‘m absolutely speechless. It‘s not that I‘m not familiar with Christopher Nolan. The Dark Knight is one of my all time favourite films, I love Batman Begins, and in Inception he showed that you can tell a complex and original story and still be extremely stylish and cool.

Yet, I did not expect what I was going to see in Memento.
After the first minute I couldn‘t believe my eyes what I was watching. It was such an intriguing story, so unrelentingly gripping, so extremely suspenseful and unpredictable.
Some movies use a certain view of subjectivity, yet Memento never was even a minute objective.
Did that just happen?
Is that connected?
How did we get here?

Some people may laugh at me, but for me, this was Hitchcock level of suspense. Nolan tricked me, I was just in the place of the protagonist. I simply didn‘t know what or who I should trust.

Also while I feel that in newer films Nolan tends to be a bit over ambitious (TDKR, Inception) this was not the case here.
It felt that everything was on the right place. Everything somehow drove the storyline, something somewhat beautiful ended it, yet left so much unanswered.


I don‘t know how much to praise this movie more, but I can say that although it was my first watch, I would directly count it to me favourites."
8,"Finally finished watching North By Northwest (1959) After so many attempts I finally watched North By Northwest. I know, how could I never seen it before?
Hitchcock is my favourite director and I love nearly all of his movies. And Although it is considered one of the greatest movies ever, I never watched North By Northwest.

I thought it was fantastic, it wasn‘t only suspenseful as hell, but also really well written, acted and visually iconic.
I also really loved the humor in it. 
Personally, I still did not think that it had the ingenuity and brilliancy of Hitchcock‘s finest films, that being Psycho (my second favourite film ever) and Vertigo.

What do you think about North By Northwest?"
8,"What's the greatest Movie Poster / Blu Ray Cover etc. of all time? I've thought about this quite a while. Like with book covers, the advertising poster of a movie or cover of a certain blu ray \(without knowing the movie itself\) is one of the biggest factors for deciding if you watch it or not.

Therefore, a great Movie Poster is really important for not only selling your movie, but also make it identifiable with something.

In your opinion, what are the greatest Movie Posters of all time?


For me:
- Jaws (1975)
- Raiders of The Lost Ark (1981)
- Vertigo (1958)
- Captain America Civil War (2016)
Some that come to mind"
8,"There Will Be Blood is the Citizen Kane & The Godfather of our generation. An All Time Great American Movie. After I finished watching There Will be Blood for the first time since about two or three years I can finally appreciate everything about it.

Undeniable, the parallels to Orson Welles Citizen Kane & Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather are conspicuously. We have the fall and rise of the main character.

Charles Foster Kane's rise to the top as a newspaper tycoon, only to see him fall apart because of his never ending ego. Coppola does this nearly the same, as The Godfather Pt1&2 are more or less one big movie. The first one shows the rise of Michael Corleone, with Vito falling, while the second one provides us some retro perspective seeing Vito rising, and Michael falling.

Daniel Plainview is no different. He rises to the top as an oil seller, only to be torn apart by the amount of money he made, selling his soul, his son, his pride.

There is no ""Rosebud"" for Plainview, he simply is a madman. But he is still human, he is still somebody that we can root for. Simply because he is everything a man aspires to be: confident, ambitious, successful.

Exactly this is the theme for Coppola's Godfather. We get introduced to the Mafia world, and a straight up evil, bad and flawed man like Vito and his son Michael are human.

What these films have in common isn't only the blueprint of a rising and falling character arc. No. Instead, the characters feel incomplete. Sure, there is a beginning middle and end, CK & Godfather even ends the same way it opens. But there is no catharsis, we don't get to know these men better because we have reached the end. 

Above all, Coppola, Welles and PTA deliver a study of a man. Nothing more. No sophisticated, philosophic or hidden meaning. Just about the rise and fall of a man.

What do you think of There Will be Blood?"
8,"The coffee conversation scene between Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) & Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro) is one of the greatest scenes of all time. Finished watching Michael Mann‘s Heat from 1995, and one scene in particular that I found amazing was the coffee conversation in the middle.
It‘s superb dialogue, every word means something, everything builds upon the following, the camera angle is perfect - never allowing us to see both faces at the same time, the visual storytelling is phenomenal, the face acting is fantastic, and the conversation even turns out to be grimly funny

What do you think about this scene?"

I wouldn‘t count the movies of The James Bond franchise as sequels, since as they change different actors portraying Bond, in different timelines, and this for nearly 60 years. But if so, Casino Royale is (imo) the best James Bond movie. 

Sequels better than the original:"
9,"The fastest movie shark isn't in Jaws 2, Deep Blue Sea or The Meg. The great white shark in Shark Night 3D hits 66 MPH while chasing a jet ski riding college kid. Quick note: The 20th anniversary of *Deep Blue Sea* is July 28th,  thus, I've gone a bit shark movie crazy, and that is why this post exists.  Also, I'm always down to [write about movies featuring jet skis](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5ckqc0/movies_that_feature_jet_ski_action_scenes_have_an/). 

*Shark Night 3D (2011),* a movie about college kids being eaten by sharks, features the fastest shark ever seen on the big screen (only counting wide-release shark movies). This may seem implausible considering the larger-than-life sharks in [*The Meg*](https://youtu.be/VAmXYYSt6TM),  [*Deep Blue Sea* ](https://youtu.be/rvqm61CcOLo)and[ *Jaws 2* ](https://youtu.be/yr923CbtKsU) got up to speeds of 30-45 MPH for extended periods of time. In the real world, great white sharks can hit speeds of 35 MPH for short bursts. However, in the fictional world of *Shark Night 3D*, A great white shark hits 66 miles (106.2 km) per hour during its pursuit of Blake (Chris Zlyka), a jet ski riding college student who must've been surprised as us when he is eaten. 

[Here is the clip if you want to watch it.](https://youtu.be/a_nZAKKAJBw)

[This clip proves the great white had no problem keeping up with the jet ski.](https://youtu.be/ImsJEktdvp0)

The following breaks down the jet ski moment and figures out how fast the shark had to swim to kill the unlucky college student.

**Here is what I know:**

1. The scene takes place towards the end of the movie when Blake (Chris Zlyka) is trying to get his one-armed friend Malik (Sinqua Walls) to a hospital via a jet ski. Malik notices that a shark is gaining on them (they are going 40 MPH easily) and decides to sacrifice himself to the shark, so Blake can get away. The problem is that Blake comes back to save his friend (he doesn't) and quickly realizes he needs to speed away to escape the bullet-shark. A chase ensues!
2. The length of the chase is 102 seconds.
3. The guy (Blake) is riding a 2010 Yamaha Waverunner FZS that is capable of a 68-70 MPH top speed.
4. It could only have been the great white shark because the hammerhead was dead, the tiger sharks were in a cage, and the bull shark was busy in the mangroves killing another unlucky college student.

 

[The guy had a head start and the shark still passed him easily. Dang. ](https://i.redd.it/t8dy7uhrqoc31.png)

**Here are my assumptions:**

&#x200B;

![img](nat83yxgooc31 ""A very technical look at the final seconds.
"")

1. Blake has a 20-foot head start on the shark.
2. Blake's top speed was 50 MPH on the jet ski (73.3 feet per second).
3. The total distance he covered was 7,476.6 feet (in 102 seconds)
4. The scene is interrupted by a moment involving the dastardly sheriff harassing more college students, but I kept counting the seconds and assumed the scene was happening in real time.
5. The shark hits 0-60 MPH in 6 seconds and covers 309 feet in that time.
6. The shark kept up a constant speed of 66 MPH (96.8 feet per second) for 76 seconds after hitting 60 MPH
7. The shark passes Blake underwater (it only takes 12.5 seconds) and doesn't attack because this is a movie — and that wouldn't look cool.
8. The shark traveled 7,663 feet (in 82 seconds) from the beginning of the chase until the end.
9. The extra 20 seconds were used to turn around and jump out of the water. Why 20 seconds? The shark is huge, and would need the time to turn around and get ready for the perfect jump (Seriously, a perfect jump).

 **Conclusion:**

The math based on my assumptions have the great white shark traveling at a maximum of 66 MPH for 76 seconds. This breaks every shark speed record (real and cinematic) ever and proves *Shark Night 3D* wasn't messing around when it came to the abilities of its sharks. I don't think this was the work of two sharks because the other sharks were engaged with other things, and I don't believe they were so smart they could eliminate jet skiers with teamwork. There is no exact way to know how far he traveled on the jet ski, but Its safe to assume that the shark hit at least 60 MPH during the scene which would still break every shark record known to man (and sharks)

9,"In honor of the upcoming 20th anniversary of Deep Blue Sea, I put on my shark fin hat and analyzed the events that lead to the classic moment involving Samuel L. Jackson and a genetically modified shark *Deep Blue Sea* is one of my favorite movies, and with its 20th anniversary approaching on July 28th, I decided to over-analyze the movie to breakdown the surprise death of Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson). Even if you haven’t watched *Deep Blue Sea*, I’m 92.434% certain you know about Samuel L. Jackson’s surprise death, because it’s perfect. Here is how it goes down, the skeleton crew of Aquatica, an ocean research facility, are being chased by sharks and infighting has started amongst them. Noticing that morale is getting dangerously low, Franklin interrupts them and delivers a pep talk about how he survived a massive avalanche in the Alps. When he is about to hit the high-note of his speech, a shark comes out of the water and eats him mid-sentence. ([clip here](https://youtu.be/BS8I9H07wKw)) ([https://youtu.be/BS8I9H07wKw](https://youtu.be/BS8I9H07wKw))

&#x200B;

I’ve always wondered if the shark waited until the perfect moment to attack during the monologue. Did it purposefully wait until the high-note of the speech, or did it attack because Franklin suggested sealing up the wet entrance? Did it just randomly come across Franklin? To answer these questions, I went back and analyzed the actions of the generation II Mako shark (the 45-foot one) leading up to the classic death. We know the sharks planned the flooding of the facility, so they could escape through the aluminum fencing, which was 8-feet above the water. However, after uber-analyzing their plan, I’ve come to realize just how intricate and well-thought-out it was (The Joker from *The Dark Knight* would be jealous). I know the sharks don’t succeed, but they tried their hardest to escape the research facility of horrors.

Before I get into Samuel L. Jackson’s death, I wanted to give you a quick overview of the events that transpired before it.

&#x200B;

[ This is a layout of Aquatica. Deep Blue Sea does a great job of breaking down the geography of the facility. ](https://i.redd.it/gvphbpt8l9b31.png)

Quick note: The generation II mako was given an extra dose of the smart serum 24-hours before the test. So, it’s REALLY smart during the rushed testing process.

1. When Carter Blake (Thomas Jane) goes out to catch the shark, it starts taking out the underwater security cameras so the people in the lab can’t track it, AND so they wouldn’t notice that it guided itself perfectly to land on the boarding platform
2. [**The 8-ton shark lands PERFECTLY on the boarding platform**](https://youtu.be/i31XFSORRfc). Carter Blake is good, but he isn’t good enough to tranquilize an 8-ton shark so it lands perfectly on a boarding platform. The shark is then brought into the wetlab which is located on the second sub-level
3. The shark isn’t knocked out, it’s playing possum. That’s why it moves when the needles initially go into its head. The shark doesn’t attack Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron Burrows) because they still need to destroy her research (hence the gratuitous attack later in her room), and it knows if it bites her, it will probably die. [**So, it bites Jim Whitlock**](https://youtu.be/m2aC-nkV1Zg) (Stellan Skarsgard), knowing McAlester will let it go.
4. The shark takes out the helicopter and the [**Aquatica control center with one strategic move**](https://youtu.be/rvqm61CcOLo). The explosion also starts the flooding of the 1st sub-level
5. The shark rams the wetlab’s massive glass window with Jim’s gurney (that he is still attached to), which starts the flooding of the second sub-level. Knowing that the 1st sub-level is flooding, the shark then rams open the wetlabs doors to start flooding the 2nd level. This forces the scientists to the third sub-level (so many levels to this plan)
6. While in the wet entry on the 3rd sub-level, they learn the submersible is destroyed (which is probably a good thing). They think about making a swim for it, but it would end in death. So, they decide to open up a door leading to the elevator, which will destabilize the room and cause tons and tons of seawater to enter. This is what the sharks want. They don’t want the humans swimming because they’d stop flooding the Aquatica. The shark also doesn’t want them to seal up the wet entry either. [**So, it eats Franklin when he got too immersed in his monologue**](https://youtu.be/BS8I9H07wKw). Then, the shark knows they will depressurize the area, so it swims away and shares Franklin with its generation I mako companion. When the area is flooded, the shark comes back and knocks open the door, which further sinks the Aquatica.

The shark was waiting for Franklin to arrive at an easily eatable location.

&#x200B;

[I love this moment. Making this made me happy. ](https://i.redd.it/i5z7fo4cl9b31.jpg)

&#x200B;

When Russell finally gets into an easy position to eat, it takes 17 seconds for the shark to strike.

Here is the breakdown based on complete guesswork

1. The shark is waiting for the Aquatica crew when they arrive in the wet entry on the 3rd sub-level.
2. The wetlab entrance is 45 meters from the ocean floor.
3. The shark swims backwards to the ocean floor to keep its eyes on Franklin – This takes 10 seconds.
4. It stops and positions itself – 2 seconds.
5. it explodes from the ocean floor and covers 45 meters in 5 seconds (29.6 feet per second, 20 miles per hour) and grabs Franklin in its mouth. [**Mako sharks are known for their insane jumps**](https://youtu.be/HjlmIREzkm0), so this makes sense. For comparison, here is an [**article about Great White sharks jumping out of the water**](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/12/the-physics-of-great-white-sharks-leaping-out-of-the-water-to-catch-seals/249799/).
6. It swims away and shares the spoils with another shark.

&#x200B;

[\*This is how I see it going down. Also, excuse the crude shark.](https://i.redd.it/1990nxkel9b31.png)

&#x200B;

Renny Harlin really wanted to shock audiences with this surprise kill, and he totally did. I love how it makes logical sense, and makes the sharks seem like brilliant masterminds. Hopefully, when you watch *Deep Blue Sea* again, you appreciate the shark’s plan more, and know how it lead to Samuel L. Jackson becoming lunch.

9,"The Jean-Claude Van Damme vs. Michael Myers jet ski chase in ""Halloween VIIII - Battle on the Bayou: Michael's Final Halloween"" covered 180 miles and they circled a tiny island 848 times during the four hour chase >*Halloween VIIII – Battle on the Bayou: Michael’s Final Halloween* *is what happens when you sneeze into a cheap tissue.* [***Roger Ebert (1996)***](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deep-blue-sea-1999)

Many of you remember [***Halloween VIIII – Battle on the Bayou: Michael’s Final Halloween***](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/deep-blue-sea-celebration/)as the film that ended the run of the *Halloween* franchise. In 1996, the series was reeling after the poor performance of [***Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers***](https://youtu.be/-v8l6cCrf0w)*,* and it was given one last shot to stay relevant in the evolving horror market. Knowing that the series needed a change, the producers and executives at Dimension Films decided to send Michael Myers to Louisiana to hunt the brother he never knew he had. In a major casting coup, Jean-Claude Van Damme was cast as Police Detective Chance Strode, the long-lost older brother of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). JCVD’s career had hit a rough patch after *Street Fighter, Sudden Death,* [***Drop the Beat***](https://youtu.be/q6ObhNBURyY) and [***Spin-Kick City*** ](https://youtu.be/i31XFSORRfc)failed to hit at the box office, so, desperate for a minor rebrand, he signed on to play the role for a lesser-fee with money promised on the back end.

&#x200B;

The producers at Dimension couldn’t afford to pay an established director, so they brought in stuntman legend and first-time director Steve Balsawood (stunts for *Lawrence of Arabia, Ghost*, [***Fire 2: Too Hot To Handle***](https://youtu.be/rvqm61CcOLo), and [***Backslap: The Movie***](https://youtu.be/BS8I9H07wKw)*)* to direct a script written by a young writer named Chuck Finley, who had written the well-received and commercially successful 1995 horror film [***Don’t Throw That Knife At Me!***](https://youtu.be/HsRwyJw5o7k). If there was one concern, it was that the movie had to go from script-to-screen in a mere six months, which meant the filming would commence without a finished script and locations that were not fully scouted or vetted.

&#x200B;

[Some concept art from the movie](https://i.redd.it/ivsbttm6xnp21.jpg)

&#x200B;

Desperate to bring in additional funding to beef up the $4 million budget.  The folks at Dimension signed a partnership with Yamaha to feature their X45 jet skis for a sizable amount that would help pay for the 23-day shoot. All was good until JCVD told the producers that he wouldn’t partake in any night shoots, which forced Finley and director Balsawood to revamp the script to make it a “day-time horror picture.” After several sleepless nights, and many unforgivable insults flung at each other, the two nailed down a script that played like a *Halloween* movie met *Nowhere to Run* and *Hard Target,* then completely forgot the *Halloween* angle\*.\* The highlight of the script was a jet ski chase that featured JCVD chasing down Michael Myers to make sure he can’t obtain the Spear of Destiny, which would make him even more immortal.

&#x200B;

[I never thought I'd see Michael Myers wear a suit while riding a jet ski.](https://i.redd.it/ia6y4rmgxnp21.jpg)

&#x200B;

Shooting began soon thereafter and everything quickly became a nightmare due to unreliable jet ski prototypes, infighting, terrible weather, rewrites, adultery, rampant drug use, scurvy, bad shellfish, impromptu crying sessions and budget cuts which you can read about in Balsawood’s book [***I Hated Directing That Movie***](https://youtu.be/m2aC-nkV1Zg)*.* The rest is history, but one scene has always stuck with me and I finally decided to tackle it in hopes of making sense of it.

&#x200B;

[JCVD and a friend ride around for seven minutes talking about how great the jet skis are. ](https://i.redd.it/fwcr41rcxnp21.jpg)

&#x200B;

The following breaks down the incredibly random jet ski chase during the climax of the movie. I read in Balsawood’s book that they only had one day to shoot the scene and no locations to film the actual chase. So, the director, JCVD and a masked stuntman went out to a tiny island on the last day of principal photography and shot several hours of footage near the island. During their shooting, JCVD and the stuntman were only able to drive around the island 12 times due to the unreliable Yamaha X45 prototypes. Thus, the climax of the movie is centered around[ **two men driving around in circles**](https://youtu.be/gfXns_cU8I8).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[A nice graphic of the chase](https://i.redd.it/l9u2l57axnp21.jpg)

**Here are my assumptions:**

* They averaged 45 MPH during the entire chase
* They covered 180 miles during the chase
* They circled the tiny Louisiana island an estimated 848 times.

&#x200B;

**Here is what I know:**

I know a lot because the movie tells us everything

1. The movie has a [**36% Tomatometer score**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1090759_deep_blue_sea), and it made [**$37 million at the international box office.**](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=deepbluesea.htm) Surprisingly, it has a [**7.6 rating on IMDb.**](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149261/)
2. The X45 Yamaha prototypes have 20 gallon tanks and get 9 miles per gallon.  We learn this when JCVD says “Wow, the X45 Yamaha prototypes have 20 gallon tanks and get 9 miles per gallon.”
3. The rectangular island has a diameter of 360×160 feet and the best way to circle it on the jet ski is to stay 20 feet away from the shore (380×180 feet = 1,120 foot diameter). We learn this when Crazy Cajun Karl (Clint Howard) says “look for an island that is roughly equal to the size of a American foosball\* field….including the endzone. Make sure to circle twenty feet around the shore.”
4. The chase scene lasted four hours. I know this because during the scene JCVD yells “It’s almost been four hours and these X45 Yamahas are still running. What efficiency!”
5. The only person who can grab the “Spear of Destiny” is the man who fulfills a very specific prophecy. We learn this when Crawdaddy Kat (Kathy Bates) says “Only the man whose Yamaha jet ski runs of gas may grab the spear of destiny. He only can be stopped by a man who has run out of gas while riding the same exact Yamaha jet ski.”
6. The gas tanks were totally full. We know this because when Michael Myers and JCVD steal them, the gas station attendant says “Hey! I just filled them X45 Yamahas with gas!”
7. I know they circled the island because of the movies theme song, which peaked at number #78 on Billboard’s Hot 100 Charts in 1996. The song [**“Going in Circles” by Lit**](https://youtu.be/aFZtFoMX-EU), featured these lyrics “We’re going in circles, circles never stop because their infinite, much like Michael Myers.”

There you have it! JCVD and Michael Myers circled a tiny Louisiana island 848 times during their four-hour chase scene in *Halloween VIIII – Battle on the Bayou: Michael’s Final Halloween.*

9,"Brad Pitt movies featuring him consuming 200+ calories of food average more money and have higher averaged critic/audience scores than his movies where he eats less or nothing. **QUICK NOTE: I am not implying direct correlation equals causation. I’m just presenting random data in hopes of making a few people chuckle. Hopefully this data won’t be too much to digest.** 

For years, the narrative around Brad Pitt is that he is always eating in his movies. It’s gotten to the point where you legitimately envision him constantly snacking on a turkey leg in each of his films. For instance:

1. *Troy* – Fighting Eric Bana while holding a turkey leg
2. *The Curious Case of Benjamin Button* – Eating a turkey leg while hanging with Cate Blanchett
3. *Cool World* – Eating an animated turkey leg while chasing toons around
4. *True Romance* – Sitting on couch while eating a turkey leg
5. *Legends of the Fall* – Looking sad on a boat AND sadly eating a turkey leg

The eating discussion is so prevalent, I decided to do a rewatch of his movies to put together a master list of all the food, and see if any cool statistics popped out. I started by researching the lists and videos claiming to showcase ALL the food Pitt has consumed through the years. The helpful [**lists**](https://www.bustle.com/articles/136596-everything-brad-pitt-has-ever-eaten-in-a-movie-will-give-you-such-food-envy) ([**another list**](https://www.vulture.com/2011/09/brad_pitt_food_diary.html) **-** Great Vulture list that started it all) and [**videos**](https://youtu.be/v4eg7V7O10E) (more videos [**here**](https://youtu.be/UkaiEr0u8sc) and [**here**](https://youtu.be/YZlr_sVP51A)) are thorough and I applaud the work put into them, however, I quickly learned items were missing from the lists, or added items weren’t featured in the movies. So, I started a months long process of scouring through his movies (thank you Vudu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Crackle, Tubi, Hoopla, IMDb Freedive and my local library) to find some fun (unimportant data) I can share with you

Here are some quick thoughts/facts before I get into the eating:

1. He is really good in *12 Monkeys.*
2. He has eaten an estimated 4.986 calories onscreen.
3. *Moneyball* is better than I remembered…and I remembered it being very good.
4. *A River Runs Through It* deserved the Best Cinematography Oscar.
5. His best eating moments are in *Ocean’s 11, Fury* and *Mr. and Mrs. Smith*
6. His peanut butter eating moment in *Meet Joe Black* showcased some brave acting.
7. He was badass in *Snatch.*
8. *Burn After Reading* is really funny.
9. He has consumed 82.5% of all his calories in the 1990s and 2000s.  His 2010 eating has fallen off.

&#x200B;

[This pie chart is very fitting....](https://i.redd.it/22uaxwit9bn21.png)

**Here are the eating rules**

1. I only counted his onscreen eating. Basically, we had to see him eating. I didn’t include the implied eating from movies like *Seven* (post dinner scene with Paltrow and Freeman) or *Johnny Suede*(jelly doughnut scene)
2. I didn’t count booze, water or coffee.
3. I included his Jamba Juice smoothie and gum chewing in *Burn After Reading* because technically that’s lunch. Also, I included the blood from *Interview With the Vampire* because he is eating.
4. To figure out the calories, I found the serving size calorie amount of each food eaten onscreen and guessed accordingly. Or, I just typed in “tablespoon of peanut butter calories” or “cheeseburger calories” and worked with that. I am 98.87% confident with my calorie counts.

**What did I find out?** Brad Pitt movies featuring him consuming more than 200 onscreen calories have higher box office and critical/audience averages than his movie featuring zero eating or very little munching. I guess critics and audiences like watching him eat (no way to prove this).

**Brad Pitt movies featuring no eating**

* **Tomatometer Average** – 64.%
* **IMDb User Score** – 6.9
* **Domesitc Box Office Average** – $68 million
* **Movies with zero calories eaten**

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/50o16duydbn21.png

The $68 million worldwide box office average can be attributed to *World War Z* being the only blockbuster type movie in the category. However, it is the most award nominated category with Pitt receiving Academy Award nominations for *12 Monkeys* (Best Supporting Actor) and *The Big Short*(Producer), and winning an Oscar for *12 Years a Slave* (Producer).

If you get a chance watch *Snatch, Killing Them Softly, True Romance* and *World War Z*. Pitt is very good in them.

&#x200B;

**Brad Pitt movies featuring him eating 1-200 calories**

* **Tomatometer Average** – 61%
* **IMDb User Score** – 6.8
* **Domestic Box Office Average** – $110 million
* **List of movies by calorie intake**

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ud85ltyaagn21.png

One of my favorite Brad Pitt eating moments takes place in *Fury* during a very uncomfortable lunch scene\*.\*  I think it might feature the greatest eating of a single egg in cinema history. Aside from the egg eating in *Fury*, the eating moments in these movies are mundane and mostly feature Pitt eating a few bites here and there. My favorite moment of Pitt’s “non-eating” takes place in *Seven*, when he looks at a piece of pizza with absolute disgust and throws it back on a plate without eating it. While watching these movies again, it’s clear that Brad Pitt taught *The Big Bang Theory* actors how to fake eat and act, because he does A LOT of it.

If you haven’t watched *The Assassination of Jessie James By the Coward Robert Ford* you need to do it now. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is mind-blowing and I guarantee Pitt has never looked better while eating. I also love *The Tree of Life,* and I appreciate the way cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki shoots Pitt eating as well.

&#x200B;

**Brad Pitt movies featuring him eating 200+ calories**

* **Tomatometer Average** – 67%
* **IMDb User Score – 7.0**
* **Domestic Box Office Average** – $143 million
* **Brad Pitt movies featuring him eating 200+ calories**

https://i.redd.it/bd50zino8bn21.png

I have a feeling that *Ocean’s Eleven, Moneyball* and *Meet Joe Black* are the primary reasons why people think Brad Pitt is always eating onscreen. The eating in *Ocean’s 11* is truly excessive and I kinda love it. Pitt’s commitment to shoveling food in his face is a lot of fun and I like how it continues on through the successful trilogy. Also, *Moneyball* gave us the visual of Pitt shoveling an entire Twinkie into his mouth, while *Meet Joe Black* features the strangest peanut butter eating ever.

I do like how Pitt’s eating and acting are never the same. Here are some examples:

* *Ocean’s trilogy* – Cool eating
* *Moneyball* – Stress eating
* *Meet Joe Black* – Curious eating
* *Interview With the Vampire* – Very hungry eating
* *Kalifornia* – Gross eating
* *Seven Years in Tibet* – I’ll eat anything eating

There you have it! Brad Pitt’s movies do better with critics and audiences when he eats more. The world can rest easy now.

9,"Based on the 12-hour ticking clock, it took Batman three hours to set up the fiery bat symbol on the bridge in ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ **Spoilers abound.**

My naive original goal for this piece was to only focus on how long it took Batman to create the bat fire on the bridge in *The Dark Knight Rises.* I thought it wouldn’t be difficult due to the [**countless maps of Gotham**](https://www.slashfilm.com/cool-stuff-official-map-christopher-nolans-gotham-city/), and [**insane amount**](https://www.businessinsider.com/bridge-blow-up-dark-knight-rises-2012-6#by-the-way-19-million-people-have-watched-that-trailer-so-it-seems-safe-to-say-that-the-movie-is-going-to-be-a-blockbuster-15) of [**nit-picky articles**](https://www.businessinsider.com/bridge-blow-up-dark-knight-rises-2012-6) ([**here is another one**](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pgga3b/the-problem-with-christopher-nolan-hes-fundamentally-uninterested-in-cities)) to help me make an educated guess. However, unlike [It Follows, which makes sense geographically,](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7xzadn/im_a_big_fan_of_the_creature_in_it_follows_so_i/) Nolan’s Gotham is all over the place, and I learned I’d have to expand my scope to establish a timeline for the bridge fire because of the multiple filming locations (NYC, Chicago, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, London) and evolution of Gotham (two Wayne enterprises etc..) throughout the *Dark Knight* trilogy. So, I used [**Eliot R. Brown’s maps**](http://www.eliotrbrown.com/wp/gotham-city-map.html), and the [**one used in the movie**](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/cartographer-gotham-city-180951594/), then, I mostly relied on visual cues based on my repeat viewings of *Batman Begins*, *The Dark Knight* and *The Dark Knight Rises*. These visual cues helped me piece together the timeline for the 12 hours Batman needed to stop Bane’s bomb from destroying Gotham, which in turn, helped me figure out how long it took to create the massive bat signal on the bridge.

&#x200B;

[Bane can see the fire from City hall](https://i.redd.it/u6s8sxrauhl21.png)

**Quicknote:** **There is no correct answer.** As always, I’ve made my best educated guess which is most likely wrong. Also, to answer your questions in advance:

1. I know it’s just a movie
2. I don’t have THAT much free time
3. Yes, *Deep Blue Sea* is underrated
4. No, I’m not Batman
5. Yes, If I had the chance I would be Batman
6. [Yes, I looked at the official map](https://www.slashfilm.com/cool-stuff-official-map-christopher-nolans-gotham-city/)
7. Jack Burton by a landslide
8. Who?

**Here are some assumptions before I get into the timeline:**

* The action at the end takes place in the Downtown area of Gotham. Why? Based on the location of the bridges, and proximity to City Hall (which is downtown) I feel safe saying it’s downtown Gotham. This is important because it helps narrow down the action.

>  
>*I’m 97.3% certain that I picked the correct bridge. It is the only one with another bridge nearby, and it leads into downtown. Also, the “strikezone” map infers that everything takes place downtown as well.*

&#x200B;

* There are only 8 hours of actual night during winter in Gotham. Why? Due to the 12-hour ticking clock, I learned the events started unfolding around 7:00 PM.
* The 12 hour ticking clock is exact. I trust Fox, and there is a handy countdown clock which helps out later on.
* The random daylight patterns prove the fictional Gotham has some weird things going on. This helps explain why darkness happens so quickly in [***The Dark Knight*** ](https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/20/17583276/the-dark-knight-joker-chase-scene-editing)and *The Dark Knight Rises.* 
* I don’t think Batman used gasoline to create the bat fire. He most likely used a special flammable “yada yada yada” substance developed by Lucius Fox.
* The locations that the characters walk to aren’t far apart. If they were, the amount of walking would be insane.

**THE TIMELINE**

**7:00 PM  – Wayne arrives at city hall – Downtown – (AKA Bane’s headquarters)** – Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle meet up with Lucius Fox and Miranda Tate around 7:00PM. We learn the bomb will be going off in exactly 12 hours. How do I know it’s Bane’s HQ? Later on at the bridge, Gordon says “Bane is holed up at city hall.” So, I’m assuming this is where they’re having the kangaroo court as well. It also makes sense that it is close to the water because they walk the unlucky exiled folks to their icy death from city hall.

&#x200B;

[ Unlucky Gotham citizens are walked up the stairs and into Scarecrow’s court. ](https://i.redd.it/qqwhu4y8whl21.png)

&#x200B;

**8:15 PM – Wayne arrives at the underground bunker located at the Gotham docks (introduced in** ***Dark Knight***\*\*)\*\* – Wayne grabs his batsuit and gear needed to battle Bane. I’m thinking it took 45 minutes because of the location to the docks.  It took them longer than usual, because they are wanted men, and they had to sneak around the city instead of brazenly walking around Gotham.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ncsj1547whl21.png

&#x200B;

**9:30 PM – Wayne arrives at the top of a random building in downtown Gotham** **(STILL NOT DARK)** – It probably took 30 minutes to bag all the gear and bat suit.  I feel safe saying The Bat location is close to the docks (it’s somewhat near the water). Also, it is walking distance to the tunnels which Bane inhabited under the downtown area. I’d love to see their journey to the top of the building (also the water in the background isn’t frozen, Gotham is a weird place).

&#x200B;

[ I’ve read online that this is Wayne Enterprises. The buildings don’t match. So I’m thinking it’s another building.  The picture below proves it isn’t Wayne Enterprises. ](https://i.redd.it/k2xbhlb1whl21.png)

https://i.redd.it/ch3i5dr4whl21.png

&#x200B;

**10:30 PM – Wayne takes The Bat to the bridge** – Wayne and Fox are in no hurry (despite Gordon being found guilty hours earlier) while they are at The Bat, Fox grabs the gear for the micro-burst while Wayne says “there is no autopilot.” I’m guessing Fox goes immediately back to the docks, while Wayne waits for dark, gets into his suit and parks near the tunnel where the cops are trapped. He hides The Bat, this makes sense because Bane’s soldiers walk by and don’t see it.

&#x200B;

[He parks The Bat very close to this area. Bane's henchmen are not very observant. ](https://i.redd.it/bxzre6gwvhl21.png)

&#x200B;

**11:00 PM – Wayne Scouts the Bridge, and Gets to Work on the Bat Signal –** Before working on the bat fire, he had to make sure there were no guards around. I’m thinking Wayne also set up a camera so he’d know if Gordon was being brought to the ice while he was working on the bridge. This may sound crazy, but I’m 100% certain he set up some kind of automated weapon that expertly darts the henchmen (you’ll understand later). Then, he uses his incredibly accurate grappling hooks ([**think catching The Joker during his fall in** ***The Dark Knight***](https://youtu.be/-eroRVQJLjo)) to pull himself up to the top of the bridge. He doesn’t use gasoline because there is no spillover, and the liquid does not spill down the bridge. I’m thinking he uses multiple cans of some kind of flammable spray to cover the 85-feet ([**Width of the bridge**](http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/brooklyn/)). This makes the job difficult because he has to cover every inch of the symbol with the spray. Also, since it’s so cold, he most likely has to go heavy with the flammable substance. Then, he has to spray a perfectly straight line down the bridge and onto the ice below.

[Dude knows how to make a fire bat.](https://i.redd.it/5xs764qlvhl21.png)

&#x200B;

**3:00 AM – Waits for Gordon to be brought out onto the ice, knocks out the bad guys, and has Gordon light the bat fire –** It’s worth noting that the villains waited over 10 hours to bring Gordon and crew out to the ice. Did they get a final meal? What I love the most about this scene is how Wayne placed a flare in a perfect spot on the ice for Gordon to see.  The biggest question mark for me during the research is how Wayne was able to knock out the henchmen from behind, then, magically appear in front of Gordon seconds later. That is why I think he set up the automated dart machine. It’s a controversial opinion but I don’t see another option.

After saving Gordon, Wayne explains the plan and gives him the piece of machinery that Fox pulled from The Bat.

&#x200B;

[Perfectly placed flare.](https://i.redd.it/plszec2hvhl21.png)

&#x200B;

**4:30 AM – Wayne saves Blake at the nearby bridge** – In another weird occurrence, we learn the armed guards have been interrogating Blake for several hours. I believe Wayne had no clue that Blake would be there, and luckily appeared just before Blake was shot. Wayne knocks out the guards, then blows a hole in the blockage with The Bat. He waits until all the cops come out of the tunnel, which would take at least 25 minutes because there are several thousand of them. After they are all out of the tunnel, he informs them of the plan, and gets them going towards battle.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/c28gzaipvhl21.png

[He is about to make a great speech to these cops. ](https://i.redd.it/4fzzcxjevhl21.png)

**6:15 AM** – **Wayne arrives at the cargo container holding the Bat Pod.**

After all the cops head towards city hall, Batman moves The Bat to a location closer to the battle. After hiding The Bat, he meets up with Kyle and they walk towards the docks again towards a storage container.  While he gets her setup with the Bat pod, Wayne conveniently says “there are 45 minutes left,” to Kyle.

[Batman has some handy cargo containers all over town](https://i.redd.it/m9den5kavhl21.png)

&#x200B;

**7:00AM** – **Kablooey.**

&#x200B;

[Ticking clocks make my life easier](https://i.redd.it/ub4ibzk8vhl21.png)

There you have it! Batman needed around three hours to prepare the bat symbol on the bridge. I know the answer isn’t exact, but, due to the timeline and width of the bridge, I’m thinking the number is correct.

9,"Blade's ""blood rave"" required, at least, 425 gallons of blood from either 40 cows, 283 adults, or 3,400 one-pint donations from local vampire blood banks A lot of blood is wasted during the rave in *Blade*. I get that the yuppy vampires lead by Deacon Frost don’t care about wasting blood, however, it seems like they’d have to ice skate uphill in order to throw a secret blood party inside a slaughterhouse and install a standalone sprinkler system that keeps blood from congealing in the hours before the vampire rave kicks off. In honor of *Blade* and it’s generous wasting of cinematic blood, I decided to figure out how much of the red liquid came out of the sprinklers during the 75 seconds that it poured onto the vampire dancers. After copious research of irrigation systems and blood (my Google search history must seem weird) I’ve come to the conclusion that somewhere around 425 gallons of blood poured out of the sprinklers, which means they drained blood from either 40 cows, 283 adults ([**think** ](https://youtu.be/1UBjRCzd8cg)[***Blade: Trinity***](https://youtu.be/1UBjRCzd8cg)) or collected 3,400 one pint donations from the blood banks they have all around the world ([***Blade 2***](https://youtu.be/wpFBJDI1I_g)).

3:18 - A good look at how much blood was on the ground

[Separate clip: :35 seconds](https://youtu.be/gHBhKbF2xMA)\- A look at a cart going by with humans hung up on it. 

**Quick note:** There is no way to know how much blood spilled onto the vampire dancers.

**Here is what I know:**

* The blood rave lasts 75 seconds. I feel bad for the cleaning crew
* The blood comes from 20 different sprinklers that are placed in the ceiling of the slaughterhouse/dancing club
* There is another irrigation system that must be for potential fires and cleaning off the bloody dancers after the rave is over
* The average office/home sprinkler system uses [**8-24 gallons per minute.**](https://homefiresprinkler.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/water-purveyors-brochure.pdf) The blood is really pouring out of the the sprinklers, so I went with 17 gallons per minute
* Blood was definitely coming out of the sprinklers
* 99.7% of the blood hits the floor
* Holstein cows have 10.6 gallons of blood. Humans average 1.2 to 1.5 gallons. I went with 1.5.
* The vampires must’ve created a machine that keeps the blood from coagulating or congealing
* The meat packing plant is a front for a weird human blood drive system
* Vampires don’t care about permanently damaging their clothes

**Here is what I’m guessing:**

* Since the rave takes place in a slaughterhouse they must be getting the blood from the animals. However, I wouldn’t put it past them to greedily use human blood
* I think the vampire overlords (AKA Udo Kier) wouldn’t be pleased to know that hundreds of gallons of human blood was being wasted on EDM loving vampires
* Since they made the “Blood Bath” sign I’m thinking they’ve done it before
* The vampire DJ worked the venue before and knows where to put the speakers so they don't get splattered with blood
* They don’t really drink any of the blood…..so it must not be human blood?
* There is no cover charge for the party
* The invitations were sent via email
* The vampires can’t leave the building with blood stained clothes, so, they must’ve brought a change of clothes to wear after the rave ends. Also, it probably ends around 4:00AM so the vampires can get home before the sun comes up
* It wasn’t hard for Blade to find the rave. I’m guessing a vampire told a friend, who told another friend and the guest list spiraled out of control. Thus, Blade could simply track an unwitting vampire who was carrying an overnight bag to the party

**Final Conclusion:**

At least 425 gallons of animal blood (or human....who knows) came out of the sprinklers designed especially for the blood rave. It’s too bad that Blade found the location because they must’ve spent a decent amount of time and money to create the event space.

[How Many Calories Did Shaggy and Scooby Doo Ingest When They Ate the Cotton Candy Glob?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/adwqbr/shaggy_and_scoobydoo_consumed_at_least_35000/)"
9,"Shaggy and Scooby-Doo consumed at least 35,000 calories each when they ripped apart and ate the Cotton Candy Glob alive in Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed. **Quick Note:** There is no way to know how many calories Shaggy and Scooby consumed while devouring the unlucky Cotton Candy Glob alive. I just made my best guess and made sure the math worked out.  

 

Ever since *Waterworld* featured [Kevin Costner murdering a random 2,000 pound sea beast for about 40 pounds](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7qsqzr/the_kevin_costner_vs_sea_eater_scene_in/) of its meat, I’ve been intrigued by random creature death in movies. That is why I’m writing this piece about a random monster that received about 25 seconds of screen time in *Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed*. [The Cotton Candy Glob was only featured for a short time](https://youtu.be/ulGMlIZNr6M), but its short life and death left a long lasting impact on me because it died brutally via being eaten alive by the film’s protagonists Scooby Doo and Shaggy. 

&#x200B;

 I get that the monster is a jerk who was trying to murder a man and his dog. However, things go quickly awry for the monster, and he was eaten alive while yelling “I will give you cavities!” It was an insulting death because the Cotton Candy Glob was a monster who was destroyed by its prey. Writer James Gunn came up with a truly inspired bit and I love the combination of the creatures terrified face and how after they ate the monster Shaggy says “I wonder if there's a liter sized soda glob anywhere?""

&#x200B;

 What is the goal of this piece? This may sound weird but I wanted to know how many calories Shaggy and Scooby ingested when they ate this frightened creature alive. To do this, I read a lot about cotton candy and learned that no two websites have the same answer. So, I averaged the results from the websites and I guestimated the amount of cotton candy that made up the creatures body. 

 

**Here is what I’m guessing:**

1. The magical monster is 15 feet tall and made of sugar and pink coloring. He is a big fluffy creature who is very unlucky.
2. Scooby and Shaggy eat at least 75% of the monster. I don’t think they would leave a half eaten cotton candy carcass lying around. That would be disgusting. The majority of cotton candy left would be strewn about the floor in little lifeless clumps.
3. According to my research, one pound of sugar makes about 25 servings. Thus, I’m guessing 50 pounds of sugar would have sufficed for the creature. Why 50 pounds? Since the creature is magical, there isn’t the typical amount of sugar that gets wasted due to faulty machines, user error and burning (thank you amazon reviews!). So, with the combination of magic and 50 pounds of sugar, I think that is enough.
4. If Shaggy and Scooby ate at least 80% of the monster they would’ve consumed 35,000 thousand calories EACH (70,000 total). This math is a result of knowing that 50 pounds of sugar equals 87,772 calories.
5. They ate the monster in 10 minutes due to their absence from the group not being overly long.
6. World champion eater[ **Joey Chestnut only consumed 21,000 calories in 10 minutes**](https://kdvr.com/2018/07/04/joey-chestnut-set-hot-dog-contest-record-and-ate-this-many-calories/) during his 2018 Nathan’s hotdog record setting performance.
7. The metabolism and inner workings of Shaggy and Scooby Doo are truly impressive and defy all logic. I wonder what is going on in there?
8. They showed zero concern about murdering a monster.

 

**Results?** – They ingested at least 35,000 calories each in 10 minutes, while eating the 15-foot candy glob monster who seemed like it felt pain as its cotton candy flesh was being ripped from its body. I love *Scooby-Doo: Monsters Unleashed* because it is such a weird little thing.

There you have it! I’m hoping you’ve always had questions about this scene, and I hope I answered them.

9,"Movies featuring snowmobile action scenes have an average critical score of 51% and average an inflated $369 million worldwide on $111 million budgets. This makes movies featuring jet ski action scenes and their 27% RT score and $123 million worldwide box office average look silly. When I released my jet ski action scene data years back I received many messages asking me to compile the data for movies featuring snowmobile (or sled) action scenes. I didn’t know if I wanted to do it because it felt too similar to the jet ski data and I didnt’ want to rehash material. However, I felt bad that I was turning down so many requests and I’m always down to point out that jet ski action scenes are terrible, so I went ahead and researched the scenes (there are many snowmobile sites that complain about the usage of snowmobiles in movies) and crunched the numbers on the action scenes!

&#x200B;

I knew the numbers would be better than jet ski movies, however, I was surprised that there weren’t that many of them. I did a A LOT of research and thought I’d have a list around 50 to 60 movies. I ended up with 22 movies that had reliable box office data and critical scores. I had to leave movies like *Tripwire, Santa's Slay* or *Icebreaker* (watch it…Bruce Campbell is the villain) out because they didn’t have critical scores or weren’t released theatrically.

&#x200B;

What constitutes a snowmobile action scene? They are scenes that feature an action set piece involving chases, jumps, spills and beheadings while on snowmobiles. It can’t just be a person riding a snowmobile on his way to an action scene. It has to feature spills, chills, bullets, carnage, avalanches or massive jumps. Watch this [***Die Hard 2***](https://youtu.be/3_zKy7ygsHY) clip and you will know what I’m talking about.

&#x200B;

Sidenote: I scoured the internet for every snowmobile action scene I could find. If I missed anything please let me know and send a clip.

&#x200B;

**Here are the numbers for movies featuring snowmobile action scenes**

* **Total Number of Movies** – 22 – *Die Hard 2, Snow Day, True Lies, A View to a Kill, The Living Daylights, xXx, The World is Not Enough, Babylon A.D.,* ***Inception***, *The Fate of the Furious, Jackie Chan’s First Strike, Die Another Day, Agent Cody Banks, Johnny English Reborn, The Santa Clause 2, Fred Claus, Mr. Magoo, Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings* (no box office), *Braven* (no box office), *Lederhosen Zombies* (no box office), *22 July* (no box office), *Deadfall* (no box office)
* **Tomatometer Average** – 50%
* **Domestic Box Office (inflated)** – $156 million
* **Worldwide Box Office (inflated)** – $350 million
* **Budget (inflated)** – $107 million

\* I had to make some changes because of the late additions of *Mr. Magoo, 22 July, Deadfall* and *Meet the Deedles*. The real lundgren would be very bummed that I missed these movies. Also, I love *Wind River* but it doesn’t feature any snowmobile action scenes. I figured I would put this here because it will most likely be brought up.

**Here are the numbers for jet ski action scene movies (for comparison):**

* **Total Number of Movies** – 17 – *The Pacifier, Hard Rain, Waterworld, Double Dragon, Transporter 2, Transporter: Refueled, Speed 2, Shark Night, Deep Rising, Fool’s Gold, Piranha 3D, Baywatch, Police Academy 3: Back in Training, You Don't Mess With the Zohan, Meet the Deedles, Universal Soldier: The Return, Dhoom 3, Manhunt (no box office)*
* **Tomatometer Average** – 30%
* **Domestic Box Office (inflated)** – $61 million
* **Worldwide Box Office (inflated)** – $122 million
* **Budget (inflated)** – $73 million

Why are the numbers higher than jet ski action movies? Here is a list that features zero correlation or causation.

1. Snowmobile action scenes have realistic and life threatening stakes. If you wipe out on a snowmobile you are in trouble. Thus, they are much more exciting and won’t make you fall asleep like you do when a jet ski action scene comes on (I literally passed out during the jet ski chase in *Baywatch*)
2. Vin Diesel loves snowmobile action scenes more than he loves jet ski action scenes. *The Fate of the Furious, xXx, and Babylon A.D*. **>** *The Pacifier*
3. *The Fate of the Furious, Inception, Die Hard 2, The Living Daylights, A View to a Kill, The World is Not Enough, Die Another Day* and *The Living Daylights* all made over $300 million at the worldwide box office.
4. Jet ski action scenes basically feature people going in straight lines……
5. 35% (7) of the snowmobile action scene movies have fresh (60%+) Tomatometer scores.
6. 7% (1) of the jet ski action scene movies have a fresh Tomatometer score
7. Directors like James Cameron (*True Lies*), Christopher Nolan (*Inception*), Renny Harlin (*Die Hard 2*) and F. Gary Gray (*The Fate of the Furious*) trust snowmobiles enough to include them in their action scenes.
8. Have you watched the jet ski action scene in *Hard Rain*?
9. James Bond loves snowmobiles.
10. The conclusion to the snowmobile chase in [**Wrong Turn 4 is bonkers**](https://youtu.be/D9m2uoWoFr8).

Movies featuring snowmobile action scenes **>** Movies featuring jet ski action scenes. The result of this totally unwarranted competition was never in doubt, however, I enjoyed finding out the results so I could write this data piece.

9,"Movies featuring Kevin Bacon make more money and have higher critical scores when his characters have two or more collegiate degrees. The more degrees of Kevin Bacon the better!  

In honor of Kevin Bacon and his illustrious career, I decided to look into his filmography to see if his movies are better when his characters have collegiate degrees. Why? Everyone loves the “[**Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon**](https://www.npr.org/2012/09/14/161130024/the-history-of-six-degrees-of-kevin-bacon)” game so I decided to take it a step further and see if his movies had better Tomatometer scores when his characters were highly educated. As always, please don’t expect correlation, causation or world changing calculations. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the dumb data about smart Kevin Bacon characters.

The data set includes 51 movies (37 total degrees) and I did my best to make sure no degree, certificate or certification went unnoticed. Since a lot of these characters are fictional, and the movies don’t spend a lot of time on his collegiate (or beyond) education, I had to make educated guesses for several movies like *Crazy, Stupid, Love, Cop Car, The River Wild* and *The Darkness.* The good news is I’m very happy with my conclusions and went into the data gathering with no assumptions or theories, which means I didn’t try to pepper my Bacon results with unwarranted collegiate degrees.

Here are the results!

**Kevin Bacon movies where he has 0 degrees**

* **Tomatometer Score – 58%**
* **Domestic Box Office (inflated) – $85 million**
* **Total Movies - 26**

There are 26 movies in this section and features Bacon as a student (*Footloose*), criminal (*Murder in the First*) or handy man who is great at battling subterranean monsters (*Tremors*).  The 58% overall score isn’t bad, with movies like *JFK* (83%), *Animal House* (91%) and *The Woodsman* (88%) doing the heavy lifting.

The most notable aspect of this category is his history of villainous characters or convicts. Movies like *The River Wild, Sleepers, Super, Trapped, JFK, Murder in the First* showcase the various ways Bacon can play squirrely and you need to check out James Gunn’s *Super,* because he makes some interesting decisions.

Also, if you get a chance check out *Jayne Mansfield’s Car*. Billy Bob Thornton directed it and it stars Bacon, Robert Duvall, John Hurt, Robert Patrick, Ray Stevenson and Frances O’Conner. The movie got zero theatrical play but there is enough in it to make a watch worthwhile.

&#x200B;

 **Kevin Bacon movies where he has 1 degree**

* **Tomatometer Score – 43%**
* **Domestic Box Office (inflated) – $50 million**
* **Total Movies - 17**

This category has the lowest Tomatometer average of the three because of *R.I.P.D., Death Sentence, Quicksilver, The Air Up There, The Darkness* and *Criminal Law*. None of these movies have a critical score above 31% and if it wasn’t for *Frost/Nixon, Cop Car* and *Mystic River* the overall score would’ve been much worse.

This category helped me realize that Kevin Bacon has played a lot of cops, detectives or FBI agents throughout his storied filmography. If you get a chance check out *Cop Car* because Bacon is fantastic in it and I loved every second of him running around like a maniac. Also, I think his *Mystic River* performance is underrated and didn’t get enough respect because everyone focused on the scenery chewers around him.

&#x200B;

 **Kevin Bacon movies where he has 2 or more degrees**

* **Tomatometer average – 64%**
* **Domestic Box Office (inflated) – $177 million**
* **Total Movies - 8**

This section has the highest Tomatometer score and box office because of *Apollo 13 (95%), A Few Good Men (82%),* *Patriot’s Day (81%), X-Men: First Class (86%)* and *Black Mass (73%).* Bacon isn’t the main character in any of them, but having him around certainly helps because he has no problem holding his own alongside Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp or Tom Hanks.

I love that his two twisted scientist characters in *Hollow Man* and *X-Men: First Class* are named Sebastian. If you are going to watch one of them, stay away from *Hollow Man* because it isn’t Paul Verhoeven’s best and there is nothing likable about Bacon’s character. I tried to watch it again for research, but I couldn’t make it all the way through because the movie has not aged well.

If you get a chance check out *Taking Chance.* It features a very understated performance from Bacon and is worth a watch.

The more degrees the better! There are outliers like *Tremors* and *The Woodsman*, but the data proves that Kevin Bacon movies featuring him with multiple degrees are appreciated more by critics. You are welcome world.

[Dolph Lundgren and His Front Kicks](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9qpeu4/im_pleased_to_announce_that_dolph_lundgren_movies/)"
9,"I'm pleased to announce that Dolph Lundgren movies featuring him throwing a variation of a front kick have higher critical scores and make more money than his films that are devoid of front kicks.  

Before we get into the data I have to say this piece represents the zenith of my data collection. I literally spent 30 minutes debating whether or not Dolph’s kick in *Dark Angel* should be considered a front kick or not (its not - [kick is at :30](https://youtu.be/SQT0GHgrI3Q)). Also, every movie viewing was a tense experience as the data teeter-tottered due to the limited number of Lundgren movies that have a Tomatometer score (16 of a possible 65). Unlike my jet ski or JCVD data the results didn’t become clear until the very end when the 0% Tomatometer rated movies *Black Water* and *The Peacekeeper* failed to feature a front kick from Dolph. The data could’ve gone either way and when you collect as much data as I do you cherish the close results that make movies like *Masters of the Universe* and *Johnny Mnemonic* exciting.

This may be controversial, but I left out *Rocky IV* because there was zero reason for Dolph to throw a front kick.  Drago may embrace steroids, but I don’t think he would dishonor himself by throwing a deadly front kick at Rocky during their boxing match. Also, how the heck does *Universal Soldier: Regeneration* not have an RT score yet? It’s a badass action film that features Dolph front kicking people. Another problem I have is the lack of love for the Lundgren directed *Command Performance*. It’s a movie about Dolph being awesome while saving the day in a “*Die Hard* in a concert venue” movie.

If you are a martial arts purist you won’t be happy with what I considered a front kick. I am well aware of the traditional front kick, however, I decided to include Teep – front push kicks and soccer kicks because they are aimed forward and there isn’t a hip turn or angled trajectory. They are straight forward kicks, and if they are done right could potentially send the victim into the next zip code. Also, the kicks didn’t have to be at humans as Dolph does front/push kick doors or large slabs on meat.  [Here is a clip](https://youtu.be/bOrZStlOJxw) from *Universal Soldier* that features Dolph kicking a slab of meat and crushing a monologue like a boss.

**Here are the results.** 

**1. Movies Featuring Dolph Throwing a Variation of a Front Kick**

* **Tomatometer Average – 34.8%**
* **Inflated Domestic Box office – $66 million** (*Red Scorpion, Showdown in Little Tokyo, Universal Soldier, The Expendables, The Expendables 2)*
* **The Front Kick Movies** *–* [***Red Scorpion***](https://youtu.be/iqbk5sO8MCA)*,* [***The Punisher,***](https://youtu.be/qQTkktLm2kI) *Showdown in Little Tokyo,* [***Universal Soldier***](https://youtu.be/bOrZStlOJxw)*,* [***The Expendables***](https://youtu.be/i38fhRT6kHY)*, The Expendables 2,* [***Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning***](https://youtu.be/gfZfwupXfNA)*,* [***Skin Trade***](https://youtu.be/MOEu8VReUGE)

**2. Movies Featuring Zero Front Kicks** 

* **Tomatometer Average – 24.2%**
* **Inflated Domestic Box Office – $34 million** (*Masters of the Universe, Johnny Mnemonic, The Expendables 3*)
* **The movies that don’t feature front kicks** *– Masters of the Universe,* [***Dark Angel***](https://youtu.be/SQT0GHgrI3Q)*, Johnny Mnemonic, The Peacekeeper, The Expendables 3, Don’t Kill It, Black Water*

**Why are the front kick movies better?**

It helps that *The Expendables* (42%), The *Expendables 2* (66%) and *Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning* (55%) have solid Tomatometer numbers and only *Red Scorpion* has a score below 10%. There really is no correlation or causation, but, it’s worth noting that Dolph’s two movies with a 0% Tomatometer rating (*Black Sea, The Peacekeeper*) do not feature front kicks. If I was putting together a Dolph Lundgren primer, four of the front kick movies would be in the five I recommend:

1. *Rocky IV*
2. *Universal Soldier*
3. *The Expendables 2*
4. *Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning*
5. *Showdown in Little Tokyo*

The main reason the scores are relatively close is because the writers of *Don’t Kill It* crafted a decent script that didn’t allow Dolph to front kick a jerky demon into oblivion. The movies 89% Tomatometer score is earned, but when you write a movie about Dolph battling a demon AND you don’t have him kick it – there is something wrong with you. Why not let Dolph kick it?

**What movie features his best front kick?**

*The Expendables 2* is his highest rated “front kick movie” and it features (in my opinion) his greatest front kick ever. Basically, he destroys a henchman with a beautiful kick that sends him over a railing. It’s awesome ([1:55 in video](https://youtu.be/_gb6yX-Uiqk)). While watching the movie again (for research) I was shocked at how many awesome things I had forgotten. Here is a list

1. Dolph front kicks a henchmen and says “Goodbye.”
2. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis drive around in a smart car
3. Scott Adkins and Jason Statham fight
4. There is a moment when Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone share the screen
5. Dolph gets to use his science background to hilarious effect
6. Chuck Norris probably kills 70 people
7. JCVD plays a great villain
8. Dolph front kicks a henchmen and says “Goodbye.”

There you have it! Irrefutable evidence that movies featuring Dolph Lundgren throwing a front kick are better than his other movie that don’t feature front kicks. You are welcome!

[Michael Myers Loves Doing Laundry](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9p9nch/halloween_movies_featuring_michael_myers_using/)"
9,"Halloween movies featuring Michael Myers using washing machines or dryers to set traps have the lowest critical scores of the franchise. Also, the Halloween series is kind of obsessed with laundry and bed sheets.  When you rewatch all of the *Halloween* movies in a short period of time it’s easy to notice patterns and trends persisting throughout Michael Myers 40-year killing spree.  I’d never watched the *Halloween* movies so close together, so I hadn’t noticed his limited kill set that essentially features a lot of stabbing, impaling and stabbing then lifting. I also never noticed the important part laundry and bed sheets play in the franchise. 

&#x200B;

During my research I noticed an interesting trend. Movies featuring Michael Myers starting laundry machines (washer/dryer) have the lowest Tomatometer scores of the franchise. *Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (6%)* and *Halloween: Resurrection (12%)* both feature Michael Myers using washing machines or dryers to help him set traps and they make *Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers* look like a classic (Tina is misunderstood). I’m not saying these two films are terrible because they feature Michael Myers proving he knows how to work appliances. I just love that the two lowest rated movies of the franchise feature Myers using laundry machines to kill people. Michael has always been down for cat-and-mouse theatrics, but these kills dampen any fear he has over the audience because their less about “pure evil” and more about Michael Myers being a jerk who likes to set lame traps for his own enjoyment.

&#x200B;

For instance, *Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (*1995) features a very weird sequence that can best be described in a list. After doing a decent amount of research I’m happy with this timeline because it accurately works around October sunsets in Illinois.

1. 10:00 AM –  Debra Strode goes downstairs to do some laundry and she realizes the washing machine is broken. She had done some earlier loads, so that explains the laundry hanging up outside in the backyard that later becomes a spider's web of doom.
2. 10:39 AM – She comes upstairs with a laundry basket and gets spooked by Dr. Loomis
3. 3:30 PM – She sees Michael inside her house and runs into the backyard where she is caught up in the laundry, she manages to get free but is killed by a hatchet wielding Michael.
4. 3:32 OM- Debra’s blood flies onto a nice clean sheet. - [Here is the clip.](https://youtu.be/ToIjxzwWrdY)
5. 3:35 PM- Michael takes the sheet off of the line and puts it in the washing machine. He doesn’t start it yet because it’s still broken (I think).
6. 4:15 PM – Tommy Doyle walks Danny Strode home and they wait for Kara Strode there, It’s unclear if Michael is in the house. He might be in the basement waiting to start the washing machine.
7. 4:47 PM – Kara Strode comes home and finds Tommy and Danny waiting for her.
8. 4:47 PM – Is Michael still in the basement? Is he fixing the washer so it will work later? It does work later…so I guess he fixes it.
9. 5:00 PM – Tommy takes her across the street to the boarding house he lives in. Later, we see Michael standing outside so he must’ve fixed the washing machine….or needed a break.
10. 7:30 PM – Abusive jerk dad comes home, the power goes out and he heads downstairs to deal with the breaker. He looks at the washing machine and opens it up to find a bloody sheet.
11. 7:35 PM – He is killed. [Here is the clip (10:16). Thank you Dead Meat](https://youtu.be/t8QdJBz7Qko)

This moment potentially proves that Michael Myers can fix washing machines. I wish the fixing the washer scene would’ve been in the producer’s cut.

&#x200B;

The moment in *Halloween: Resurrection* isn’t as intricate or planned out. However, in order for everything to work out perfectly – certain things needed to go right. These kills take place so quickly I didn’t think a timeline was needed.

1. Michael is seen on camera and two unlucky security guards go to check it out
2. Michael kills a security guard named Franklin and stuffs his head in a laundry dryer
3. Franklin’s partner Willy comes in behind Franklin and walks past all the dryers to inspect a particular dryer
4. This dryer has the head of Franklin in it which undoubtedly wrecks the sheets 
5. Willy walks backwards (exactly how Michael planned) and trips over Franklin’s decapitated body (perfect placement by Michael)
6. Willy is killed after Michael does a one-armed pull-up. ([the moment is at 2:30](https://youtu.be/nVu9WKPFPqQ))

This scene proves to the audience that Michael is a brilliant game planner who puts together intricate murder setups that involve decapitating a dude with a knife, stuffing his head into a dryer, and waiting for the other security guard to come in and look into the dryer with the decapitated head in it. I LOVE IT!

&#x200B;

Now that I’ve covered the two instances of Michael dealing with Laundry,  here are some moments from the 10 films that feature laundry or bed sheets.

1. Halloween (1978) – Michael stands menacingly next to some sheets that are hanging on a clothesline.
2. Halloween (1978) – [He locks Annie in a laundry room](https://youtu.be/sWXKMoarMRw)
3. Halloween (1978) – He cuts holes in a bed sheet to trick Lynda before he kills her. ([Clip - scene at 10:45](https://youtu.be/QfVQMYvgXuQ))
4. Halloween (1981) – Laurie has flashbacks of her mother hanging white sheets on a clothesline
5. Halloween (1981) – Michael stabs some sheets thinking it’s Laurie
6. Halloween 5 – Jamie runs into some drying laundry in the children’s hospital
7. Halloween 5 – [Jamie gets stuck in a laundry shoot](https://youtu.be/WH9XdpMzH_E)
8. Halloween 6 – Michael gets blood on a sheet when he kills a nice lady.
9. Halloween 6 – Michael puts the sheet into a washer (without soap). The jerky dad checks it out and is killed.
10. Halloween H20 – Marion Chambers goes into her laundry room to get a flashlight
11. Halloween H20 – This is a stretch but the drapes/curtains in the school look a lot like bed sheets
12. Halloween: Resurrection – Dude puts a decapitated head into a dryer
13. Halloween – Cuts holes in sheets again
14. Halloween 2 – It’s too gross a movie for anything clean.
15. Halloween (2018) - Sheets on an outside laundry line are visible while Michael is running amok. 

I have no idea why so many sheets have been destroyed or laundered, I just know the *Halloween* franchise loves putting Michael Myers and other characters near sheets and laundry.

[How Many Bullets Missed John Matrix in Commando?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/994tn1/an_estimated_3007_bullets_flew_past_john_matrix/)

&#x200B;"
9,"An estimated 3,007 bullets flew past John Matrix during the climatic battle in Commando. The misses can be traced back to the private army being ill-trained and the weapons potentially being bought from a third-party vendor who was looking to unload a cache of defective weaponry. If you are a fan of action movies you are probably familiar with the sight of Arnold Schwarzenegger vanquishing 70+ people during the climatic gunfight in *Commando*. The scene is 80s action personified because it features a larger-than-life hero defeating mass quantities of somewhat suicidal villains with a gun that never needs reloading. I love how absurd the scene is, and after watching it again, I wanted to know how many bullets flew past Arnold during the melee.

In order to figure out the number of bullets that missed, I rewatched the movie, [**scoured through various “kill count” videos**](https://youtu.be/CcXASrhk_zA), researched the weapons, and analyzed every gun-burst to ensure my guess was somewhat plausible. I know there is no way to know the exact number, but, if you’ve read my stuff before you know I do my best to be credibly wrong and almost right.

**Here is what I know:**

1. John Matrix (Arnold) comes to Arius’s (AKA jerky former dictator) compound to rescue his daughter and kill many people. To his credit he catches the private army by surprise and has the upper hand. Also the weapons and bullets he has are capable of lifting grown men off the ground when he shoots them. This means they’ve been altered in some way for optimal destruction.
2. The guards are obviously second rate and very unorganized. During the gunfight they show zero tactical awareness and are not prepared for any type of “code-red” situation. Thus, when sh\*t hits the fan they run around like the untrained army they are.
3. Some of the soldiers are so terrified and ill-trained they can be [**seen shooting in the opposite direction**](https://youtu.be/HjNQLXXwYfw) of where Matrix is.
4. The exiled dictator didn’t have enough money to hire hundreds of guards so he bought dummies and placed them in front of the barracks (think WWII spy tactics)
5. [**Several types of guns were used:**](http://www.imfdb.org/Commando) HK94, M16, SPAs 12, M60, Colt AR-15, Steyr AUG, Ruger Mini 14, M19911A1.
6. [**Arnold wiped out 74 people during the final battle**](https://uproxx.com/filmdrunk/commando-every-kill/) (72 soldiers + Arius + Bennett = 74).
7. The only wound Matrix received was from grenade shrapnel. No bullets hit him.

**Here is what I’m assuming**

1. The majority of the guns had 30-round magazines; the ranges vary but I like this assumption. Also, several of the soldiers had hand guns which I made sure to research.
2. The weapons were bought from a shady third party vendor who was looking to unload a cache of faulty/rusty/malfunctioning weapons. I’m guessing Arius needed weapons fast and these were available. We never see guns jamming but defective weapons wouldn't help their accuracy. 
3. Arius used a third party vendor because he was in exile and doesn’t have access to legit weaponry because of limited cash flow. He likely had to buy wholesale. I’d love it if Vern from [Free Fire](https://youtu.be/oDD3I0uOlqY) was the seller. You need to watch *Free Fire*.
4. Due to lack of training and discipline, the guns weren’t cleaned or properly inspected for flaws.
5. The private militia spent zero time at a range. Between never training and potentially having faulty guns (that could jam) they had no chance of hitting John Matrix during the battle.
6. During the gunfight many soldiers were “Arnied” before they were able to fire off entire magazines. I counted them as shooting 10 bullets (1/3) or 20 bullets (2/3). I watched each kill multiple times and I’m happy with my assumptions that are in no way correct.
7. The two M60’s shot 340 bullets.

**How many bullets flew past John Matrix during the final battle?**

After watching each kill and calculating the amount of bullets shot, I think that at least 3,007 bullets flew past Matrix. This means each soldier shot an average of 41 bullets at Matrix and missed. Which is kind of awesome because it seems like Matrix is capable of dodging bullets (John Matrix > Neo).

I’m happy with the 41 bullet average because half of the soldiers (36) were “Arnied” before they could unload their magazines or even shoot a single bullet (estimated 664 bullets). The M60 bullets added greatly to the total (340 bullets) and I think the four soldiers who had the high ground shot three clips each (90 bullets per roof shooter – 360). The rest of the “soldiers” were able to unload at least one magazine (840 bullets) and I’m guessing the five soldiers who surrounded the shed unleashed 190 rounds (The M60 played a big part in this). Arius shoots 40 bullets at Matrix and it’s safe to assume there were 19 additional shooters who were able to unload an extra 30-round magazine at Matrix (573). This leads us to 3,007 missed bullets. I think that is as close as you can get to the actual totals.

There you have it! The soldiers in *Commando* were ill-trained and were most likely shooting malfunctioning weapons.

How far Did Nic Cage Run Around in a Bear Suit in The Wicker Man Remake?"
9,"20 years ago, in Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, Michael Myers stepped into a car and drove from Langdon, Illinois to a fictional northern California town. He covered 1,994 miles, averaged 63.2 MPH, refueled nine times, and was stymied by a flat tire I put this piece on Reddit last year, but I had to bring it back to celebrate the 20th anniversary of *Halloween H20: Twenty Years later.* This cross country trip is a thing of beauty and I feel the world needs to know more about it. 

The only thing that can stop an unstoppable force is a red traffic light. For over 40 years Michael Myers and his driving skills have been scrutinized and mocked. How did a “shape” who lived in a mental institution learn how to operate a vehicle? Michael’s driving in the first film has never bothered me because the driving was erratic and primal. The driving that bothers me is in *Halloween H20: 20 Year Later* because he made a 1,994 mile trip successfully with zero citations or tickets. In the film Michael drives from Langdon, Illinois to Hillcrest Academy in Northern California in a daring feat that raises a lot of questions.

1. Does he wear the mask when driving or siphoning gas?
2. Did he listen to the radio?
3. How does he deal with merging onto highways? Is he cool about it?
4. Does he dislike people who drive slow in the fast lane?
5. Does he not know how to fix a flat fire?

I remember loving the film as an impressionable 15-year old punk. The movie had thrills, Dawsons Creek-esque dialogue and Jamie Lee Curtis going on the offensive. However, I’ve never liked that a mysterious shape could drive cross-country. Michael Myers works best as a mysterious murderer who doesn’t have parent issues and could care less about following traffic rules. He had to navigate a lot of terrain on his journey which means he had to follow the rules and not murder people who cut him off.  The trip took him an estimated 45.5 hours (thank you for the time change assist Reddit). Here is the timeline (with some guesswork and actual times from the movie):

**October 29 – 5:30PM** – Leaves Langdon in a stolen 1971 Buick Skylark.  A  handy grandfather clock states that it is 5:30PM.

**October 31 – 9:00AM** – Michael steals a 1956 International Harvester Travelall  at a rest stop off Highway 139 in Northern California.

**October 31 – 10:00AM**– Arrives in the fictional town and cruises around a bit before he settles on main street at 11:00AM

**October 31 – 1:00PM** – Follows Laurie from the downtown area and finds out where the school is.

**Total time:** 45.5 hours

Breakdown of hours

32 (driving Highway/Susanville) + 6.5 (refueling) + 2 (waiting on main street) + 2.5 (waiting at rest stop) + 1 (eating? He eats rats in Resurrection…dude needs snacks) + 1.5 (nap?) = 45.5

Michael left Langdon on October 29th at 5:30PM in a 1971 Buick Skylark and drove all the way to California. He was forced to stop close to his destination when an unfortunate flat tire forced him to stop at a rest stop along Highway 139. During the trip he had to make at least nine pit stops to refuel because the 71 Skylark only averaged 15 miles per gallon and the 15.2 gallon gas tank only got him a maximum of 228 miles. I think it might be easier for him to refuel at night but according to the math he had to make five daytime gas stops. That had to get kinda complicated because he had no money, doesn’t talk and didn’t steal any steal cars. 

To make it in 29 hours like the Google map states he would have to drive 68 MPH. I don’t buy it so I slowed him down to 63.2 MPH. 63.2 X 32 hours on the road = 2.022.4. He covered 1,994 miles on the various highways and 28.4 on Highway 139 and various other roads after he found the school.

Since Langdon and Hillcrest are fictional, I found cities that are relatively close to the locations. Langdon was in Livingston County, Illinois so I found a town that had a similar population. Then, I looked along Highway 139 in Northern California and picked Susanville due to its proximity to the highway and Yosemite State Park (because there is a convenient school trip there). The locations aren’t exact but I was working with fictional towns so I to make an educated guess.

After coming up with the distance and car information I started thinking about Myers using his blinker while making turns or switching lanes. There is nothing less frightening than thinking about him casually flipping on the blinker to make a left turn. After looking at the directions Michael had to use his blinker AT LEAST 17 times (per google maps) if he always stayed in the slow lane. If you add the nine pit stops to exit the highway and his cruising around the small town that is somewhere around 40. Thus, Michael Myers the unstoppable killing force had to use his blinker 57 times. Immortal demons with pitch black eyes should never be bothered with speed limits, rear view mirrors and potential zipper merges.

There you have it! Michael Myers successfully completed a long drive and never got pulled over.

**Random Fact:** Movies featuring Michael Myers driving long distances (100+ miles) [make more money] (https://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=halloween.htm) (counting inflation) and have higher Rotten Tomatoes averages than the movies that don't feature him driving.

9,"During its 18 day Brody hunt, the psychic shark in 'Jaws: The Revenge' swam 3,053 miles, set a successful buoy trap and accidentally ate a woman who was enjoying a ride on a banana boat I’ve been over-analyzing movies for several years and I don’t think a movie has ever foiled me like *Jaws: The Revenge* has. In my effort to track the shark’s movements and distance traveled, I found myself grasping for straws and pondering whether the shark could smell Ellen Brody’s tears when they hit the water as she is leaving Amity for the Bahamas (it didn’t….I think). I know the original script (and novelization) featured a subplot involving a witch doctor cursing the family and that is why they are pursued by the shark. However, since it was left out of the movie, I’m assuming the aquatic monster is a vengeful and psychically-linked relative of the other two sharks (*Jaws 3* isn’t canon anymore) who is basically a sea dwelling combination of the hunters in *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid* and Anton Chigurh (*No Country for Old Men*). Over the 18 days that this movie takes place, the 25-foot shark manages to set a successful buoy trap in Amity, swim over 3,000 miles, and hunt almost every member of the Brody clan via a mystical GPS system

The following breaks down every facet of this movie and I hope it helps you understand it a little more.

**Here is the timeline and estimated shark mileage for Jaws: The Revenge.**

1. December 19th – The shark sets a buoy trap and kills Sean Brody. How many traps has it set? How long has it waited?

2. 12/20 – This will be controversial in many 'Jaws' circles but I believe the shark starts its journey towards the Bahamas after it kills Sean. It knows Ellen won't go in the water  so it decides to wipe out her other son Mike

3. 12/21 – Swimming

4. 12/22 – Swimming

5. 12/23 – The Brody’s head to the Bahamas. 

6. 12/24 – Christmas Eve – Shark is still swimming.

7. 12/25 – Christmas – Shark is almost there.

8. 12/26 – Ellen senses the shark is near when she steps in the water (I'm not making this up). The shark swims past Mario Van Peebles (I’m not naming his character because Mario wrote his own dialogue and did what he wanted which is cool) and tries to kill Mike Brody – So far, the shark has only attacked the Brodys.

9. 12/27 – ?

10. 12/28 – ?

11. 12/29 – ?

12. 12/30 – ?

13. 12/31 – ?

14. 01/01 – ?

15. 01/02 – Mike and Mario chum the water and tag the shark with a tracker. The shark is not pleased and probably feels like an idiot for being tricked because prior to this it seemed pretty smart.

16. 01/03-  Mike and Mario track the shark but they lose it.

17. 01/04 – The shark attacks Mike, but fails again. This is when it decides to attack other family members because Mike has proven himself to be elusive.

18. 01/05 – The shark kills an unlucky lady while attacking Mike’s daughter. Ellen Brody takes off in a sailboat(?) and the shark starts following because they are psychically linked. This leads to the shark spearing itself on a boat due ti electrical impulses.

**Tin Foil Hat Theories:**

1. The first time we see the shark in *Jaws 2* it is snooping around the sunken Orca. I'm thinking the shark is a relative putting together clues as to what happened to its family member. 
2. *Jaws 3* isn't canon anymore but we know it is hunting the Brody kids and this is when it starts its supernatural shenanigans. [(thank you Cracked)] (http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-reasons-worst-jaws-movie-underrated-masterpiece/).

**Here is what I know:**

1. The shark set a trap for Sean Brody [(clip here)] (https://youtu.be/MG_ZMkTJ1dA). It found a log and wedged into a buoy and hoped Sean came to sort it out. I say this because when the log is shown later it looks like there are teeth imprints in it.
2. The shark swims 1,193 miles in six days to get to the Bahamas. It averages 198 miles a day (8.28 miles an hour without stopping).
3. The shark and Ellen have a weird psychic connection which creates visions for both her and the shark. The interesting thing is she is able to see events that she wasn’t around for. This must mean that shark had a psychic connection with its relatives, and when it kills Sean, the shark bonds with Ellen and the visions are shared. This is weird.
4. It attacks on December 26th, then disappears for seven days. Vacation?
5. It didn’t mean to kill the banana boat lady [(clip here)] (https://youtu.be/i-VM7_DJlkQ) and only went after Mario because he was messing with it. The shark didn’t even bother attacking Michael Caine when the plane crashed.
6. It does not like electrical impulses.
7. The shark roars....Why not? If it can follow a family via a psychic link then it could easily roar. 

**How far did it swim?**

It’s impossible to calculate the exact number of miles traveled but with some assumptions and guesswork I’m thinking I can get pretty close to the actual distance. After doing some research I learned that Great Whites have to continually swim and since this shark is a supernatural creature it can defy logic and swim way too fast and cover way too much distance in no time.

1. The shark swam 1,193 miles to the Bahamas so we know it has no problem putting in some serious miles.
2. During the six question mark (?) days I’m guessing it trolled around at 5 MPH and covered 120 miles a day (720 miles total)
3. It hunted the Brody boys for five days and during that time it made some quick moves and covered some serious ground. I’m thinking it swam an average of 8 MPH during these days. (960 miles).
4. On the final day when the shark killed the banana boater and dashed after Ellen it had to be moving at a fast speed. So, it’s believable to assume that is swam an average of 10 MPH from 12:00AM till it was killed at 6:00PM. (180 miles).

**Total Estimated Distance – 3,053miles**

It took me a long time to put this together and I’m really happy with the mileage and timeline. This was by far the hardest “dumb data” article I’ve ever written but I feel like it helps make sense of a movie that makes zero sense.

9,"Elektra's sandbag trainer in Daredevil (2003) required 13 hoists working on a remote timer, 290 feet of speed rail, 130 pounds of sand, a red sharpie and a shop-vac The training montage in 2003's Daredevil might feature the most impractical training set up of all time. I know Elektra comes from a family of billionaires (in the movie) so I guess they don’t mind getting copious amounts of sand on their beautiful wooden floors and hanging hoists from an intricate system of tracks (or pipe) from their ceilings. However, it seems like a lot of unnecessary work and I have no clue who installed it — or who was going to clean it up after her training was done. There is a lot of sand on the floor after the training session, and if you’ve ever been to a beach you know that a tiny amount of it can get everywhere and turn your car, clothes, and bags into a cleaning nightmare.

After [watching the training clip too many times] (https://youtu.be/RBbD5SCND3M) and viewing the behind-the-scenes documentaries (I now own a Daredevil/Elektra/League of Extraordinary Gentlemen 3-pack Blu-ray) I have a solid guess as to what went into creating the intricate system of 13 sandbags being released from the ceiling via a system of timed hoists that work on a remote timer. I don’t think this was her regular training spot because it would be terribly impractical, so I’m guessing she had it installed after her father was killed. People make weird decisions when they want revenge, and it must’ve been confusing for the people in the household when she told them she wanted an intricate training system involving hoists, remote timers and enough pipe to cover the entire ceiling. Also, since the sequence is heavily choreographed, (she drew a red face on the final sandbag) she had to coordinate the timing and location of each drop and plug it into a remote system that controlled the hoists. This is something that would take a while to build, tweak and for the sake of her secret identity remove when they have dinner parties. Thus, Elektra wasted precious training time while she waited for a training rig to be built that would only give her a 35-second training experience.

**Here are my assumptions**

1. Money wasn’t an issue so the equipment was custom and very expensive.
2. She picked the room because of the size of it. It was probably the only room with enough space to house the sandbag trainer.
3. Since we see nothing along the walls of the room (no counterweights, locking rails, belayed rope lines) I have to assume that everything was rigged on the ceiling. Trussing would be overkill, so I’m guessing whoever installed the sandbag trainer created a grid of speed rail that was clamped together and attached to the ceiling by steel cables in the studs in the ceiling.
4. Electricians rigged the individual hoists to one system which allowed them to work on one remote.
5. Since there isn’t a scissor lift or ladders in the room, the rigged hoist system helps her lower/raise the rope on each hoist so she can tie sandbags on to them.
6. There are more bags left hanging after her training session is done. This means she has multiple remote settings. and can control each individual hoist to make everything easier for her (or overworked house staff).
7. Each sandbag weighs 10 pounds and is attached to a very strong and thin rope.
8. She (or a staffer) probably fills up the sandbags in the garage or garden and they are carried up to the room.
9. 11 of the 13 sandbags are dropped directly down. There is zero swing when they land, so the drop has been perfectly timed to prevent bouncing and rope breakage. Also, something had to release the two swinging bags which means there are clamps that work on timers(?)

**Here is what the sandbag trainer needed**

1. 13 hoists that work independently of each other while being on the same remote.
2. A remote timer and control that is probably in an unseen pelican case in the corner of the room.
3. 290-feet of speed rail to create the grid attached to the ceiling. I came up with this amount because she traveled an estimated 20-feet while training and the grid needs to cover the width of the room (20×30) because of the swinging bags – [Watch this clip, because it’s exactly what I see it looking like] (https://youtu.be/aKRzeUKja28).
4. Two clamps on timers that release the swinging sandbags during Elektra’s training.
5. 130 pounds of sand.
6. A shop vac or a large broom.
7. One red sharpie.
8. Slip-proof shoes to prevent her from slipping on loose sand.


There you have it! The sandbag trainer required a lot of work (and sand) and probably cost well over $20,000 to install. The whole thing seems terribly impractical, but it seems to work for Elektra because she has some legit skills and enough free time to set everything up. I doubt she cleans up the sand, but you can’t expect a billionaire heiress to be sweeping up sand when she is in revenge mode.

"
9,"10 years ago today the world had the honor of watching Mark Wahlberg talk to fake plants and eyeball lemonade in 'The Happening' M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite directors because he isn’t afraid to swing-and-miss. His films The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, The Village, Lady in the Water, The Visitors and Split (forget the other two) are mind-bogglers that are either great or terrible. His box-office hit ($193 million internationally) The Happening is one of his biggest head-scratchers because it makes very little sense and features heavily directed performances that work against the dark themes. It’s an earnest horror movie that is like it’s killer in that it is “an act of nature and we’ll never fully understand it.” I love The Happening because of its total dedication to being a “force of nature that is beyond our understanding.” It is an odd-gem that swung-and-missed and is easy to dislike and almost easier to make fun of.

Mark Wahlberg justifiably hates this movie but I appreciate that he went all-in and delivered the performance Shyamalan wanted. The same goes for Zooey Deschanel who isn’t given much and manages to keep a straight face while saying “can you believe how crappy people are?” Shyamalan always manages to get all-in performances from his actors and it’s interesting that they can really pay off (James MacAvoy – Split) or play as super awkward (Paul Giamatti – The Lady in the Water). It’s a credit to Shyamalan that actors believe in what he is doing and he managed to get back-on-track after his The Last Airbender and After Earth debacles. I love how Split was a massive hit and the end result is Glass which is a sequel to my favorite superhero movie Unbreakable.

The Happening is not a good movie but I like how it tells an insane story in a breezy 90 minutes. I guarantee we will never get another movie like this (for a reason) and that is why I appreciate it. When you watch as many movies as I do you begin to appreciate movies like The Happening because they are f**king crazy and are the result of a filmmaker having total control and no oversight. Some of the best worst movies happen (The Postman, Evan Almighty, Jupiter Ascending) when directors can do whatever they want because they’ve had success and can make their passion projects with zero restraint.

If you are a looking for an absolutely insane movie I totally recommend The Happening because it’s confusing, embarrassing, earnest and very fun."
9,"The unsuccessful and unnecessarily large trap that the special forces guy built in 'Predators' would've taken 11 days to build and needed 1,400 feet of vine and 140+ pieces of sharpened wood. Also, I'm pretty sure the Predators just hung out and let the guy build it before they killed him While watching *Predators* I felt bad for the special forces guy named Drake (thank you prequel comic) who spent many days building an intricate trap and having it fail spectacularly. I kept wondering how the guy was able to pull together boatloads of materials (wood, vines, rocks) without being heard or seen while preparing a trap that covered about 50 yards. there must’ve been a lot of cutting, scraping, grunting, swearing and hacking, and it seems virtually impossible that it wouldn’t be noticed. This trap went well beyond what Arnold Schwarzenegger did in *Predator* and it was all a waste of time.

Why was building the trap a waste of time? My theory is the Predators were watching and chuckling the entire time he was building it. The hunters knew what he was doing and let him set up the trap so they could kill him when he finished it. They must’ve been impressed with his ingenuity and figured it would be funny to see the latest bunch of people dealing with it on the alien hunting preserve.

I watched the scene way too many times (50-second scene) and was able to make a rough count of everything needed for the trap and how much time it would take to set up. I’m not an expert on jungle survival (I did watch Jungle though) and I couldn’t begin to explain how to make a trap that shoots spikes into the ground, but I can make an educated guess that suggests how long the Predators waited.

If you want to see a [simple graphic of the trap and some pictures I added them on Imgur] (https://imgur.com/gallery/ysGc3FK).

[Here is a clip of the trap] (https://youtu.be/ikrp2GMmfjc)

**Here are my assumptions:**

1. He did all the work by himself. This assumption is backed up by the Predators: Welcome to the Jungle prequel comic that was released by Dark Horse. Drake’s entire team was killed by the hunters and he became blinded by revenge which leads to his dumb plan.
2. He worked every day from sunup to sundown. I’m thinking he worked for a solid 12 hours with a few needed breaks.
3. In the comic, Drake stole a smart disc from the Predators and this tool helped him greatly with the chopping of wood (I’m guessing). So, even though we don’t see it in the movie I’m going to let him have it.
4. The Predators knew exactly what he was doing.
5. There could be more to his trap but I’m only counting what we saw onscreen.

**Here is what he used for the trap:**

*I figured out these numbers via a lot of pausing and educated guesswork

1. 1,400 feet of vines/rope/cords (at least)
2. Two large pieces of deadfall – Each piece weighs at least 750 pounds – Adrien Brody suggests they might’ve weighed 1500 pounds each, but I’m sticking with 750.
3. 100 sharpened branch pieces for the really cool but unnecessary spike trap
4. 30 sharpened pieces of thick squat wood for the spike catapult trap
5. 12 4 ft. sharpened poles place inside the 10-foot hole he made
6. 20 feet of thick branches for the large wooden spike trap
7. A bunch of palm fronds and branches to cover up trip wires and holes.

**How long did it take to set up the trap?**

1. One day to scout for a location and create a blueprint for the trap
2. One day to find all the necessary branches, sticks, trees, rope, vines, palm fronds and deadfall
3. Two days to cut the 100 pieces of wood for the overhead trap. The tops of each piece of wood have been cut flat and they’ve all been sharpened to penetrate tree roots.
4. One day to cut the 32 pieces of wood for the underground and catapult traps. If you look at the pieces of wood on the catapult trap you see will that they’ve been cut into spears. This would take a lot of work considering how big the pieces of wood are.
5. One day to dig out the 10-foot hole. The hole may have been there already but it seems too symmetrical to be natural. He must’ve done some work to make it like that.
6. One day to build the catapult spike trap
7. Three days to hang all the vines and place the wooden stakes into them. The amount of vine work is crazy because Drake set up a system that propels the pieces of wood down quickly. Thus, each piece of wood had to be specifically rigged to be shot into the ground.
8. One day to hang the deadfall for the swinging trap. I’d imagine he’d do this last to prevent it killing him while he was hanging vines.

**Total Time = 11 Days to build the massive trap**

I’m not an expert on building 50-yard traps but after watching a bunch of Youtube clips and researching limited cutting options I think 11 days is a solid option. I say this because the trap had so many time-consuming activities that it couldn’t be rushed or treated lightly. The biggest question I have about the trap is how he rigged the overhead vines without a ladder or step stool. Without a ladder, the amount of time it had to take to rig each spike in the overhead trap must’ve been very monotonous and he probably didn’t want to make too much noise which would’ve prevented serious hacking and breaking of logs.

Conclusion: It must’ve been entertaining for the Predators because they let Drake build everything, then one of them shot him in the back. It proves that the iconic hunters have a sense of humor and don’t mind letting others do work for them.

9,"I'm a big fan of Kevin Smith's View Askew Universe so I decided to figure out the perfect Smith film. The ideal movie needs 105 f-bombs, One unique riff on Star Wars, hockey being played, Silent Bob giving relationship advice and a $5 million budget. Kevin Smith is one of my favorite filmmakers and I’ve followed his career ever since I was lucky enough to get my hands on a *Clerks* VHS tape (Thanks Blockbuster) when I was 13. I’ve watched all his movies (even *Yoga Hosers*), read his books and listened to his podcast before podcasts were a thing. I appreciate how he made his own way in the film industry and his exploits have been very influential.

If you’ve been reading my stuff for some time you know that I love writing about weird cinematic moments and doing way too much research in order to figure out how many times Michael Myers used his blinker while driving in *Halloween H20: 20 Years Later.*  I enjoy figuring out things that should never be found out, and after Smith’s recent heart attack I started rewatching his View Askew Cinematic Universe movies and I began thinking about the ideal Kevin Smith film. Is there an ideal amount of f-bombs or Star Wars references? What should Silent Bob talk about? What is the perfect budget?  So, I broke down his View Askew (Featuring Jay and Silent Bob) films and brought in Rotten Tomatoes critic scores, audience score, and domestic box office numbers to make a case for the perfect Smith movie (the science is far from exact).

Here are the movies with their Tomatometer scores (RT)

1. Clerks  –  88% RT
2. Mallrats – 55% RT
3. Chasing Amy – 88% RT
4. Dogma – 67% RT
5. Clerks 2 – 63% RT
6. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back – 53% RT

*I excluded *Jersey Girl* because of its PG-13 rating and *Zack & Miri Make a Porno* because it isn’t in the View Askew universe. Don’t ask about C*op Out.*

How many F-bombs?

Characters in the View Askew Universe drop an average of 127.8 F-bombs in each movie, which isn’t terrible considering it’s only about an average of 1.1 f-bombs dropped every minute which leaves a lot of room for other Smith musings. After looking at each movie and their Tomatometer scores it appears the ideal amount of F-bombs dropped is 105. How did I come up with this number? *[Clerks,] (https://youtu.be/WTw51Ynkn7A)* *Chasing Amy* and *Dogma* are Smith’s highest rated films so I averaged the number of f-bombs between them and came up with the answer. I agree with the final tally because *Mallrats* (54) and J*ay and Silent Bob Strike Back* (248) went too high and too low with their usage of f*ck, so, it seems only fair that 105 F-bombs would be the perfect fit because they wouldn’t drown out all the other creative swear words.

**Answer: 105 F-bombs**

**How many Star Wars references?**

The View Askew Universe is littered with Star Wars references that range from one-off comments to naming a movie *Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back*. After sorting through all the references I noticed something very important, Kevin Smith’s Star Wars references are best when they riff on something new and fresh about the famous fantasy world. For instance, both *Clerks* and *Chasing Amy* had discussions/monologues that brought up some pretty great observations about Death Star contractors and [racism.] (https://youtu.be/I0VZj-85E5o) So, it seems safe to say that if another View Askew movie gets made it needs to riff on Star Wars instead of going full nerd and having Silent Bob attempting to channel the force (which I still love. Viva la *Mallrats*).

**Answer: A unique Star Wars riff and several cheeky references.**

**What should Silent Bob talk about?**

Silent Bob is at his best when he is giving relationship advice. His two most iconic moments happen in *Clerks* and *Chasing Amy* when he drops either a few words of advice or unleashes a full-on monologue about a past relationship. I know Smith couldn’t have Silent Bob always dropping relationship advice, but it’s been 20-years since *Chasing Amy* so I think it’s time to return to the well. I’m always down for Silent Bob yelling at Jay or discussing “intellectual properties” but my favorite [Silent Bob bit is in *Clerks*] (https://youtu.be/wHHjsUlRh2w) when he succinctly lets Dante know he is being an idiot (without saying it). I know it is the first time he ever talked (which makes it fresh and unexpected), but it was a very welcome comment and proved the dude was more sensitive than he acted.

**Answer: Let Silent Bob give relationship advice.**

Should hockey be played?

Hockey plays a big part in Kevin Smith’s real life and cinematic universe so it naturally has to be featured in his next film. The two best moments involving hockey in the View Askew universe are featured in *Clerks* and *Chasing Amy.* The impromptu roof hockey match in *Clerks* was inspired and fun and [‘cross-examination’ moment in *Chasing Amy*] (https://youtu.be/hKOftsmFa68) worked really well because it was inter-cut with a hockey brawl that was going on in front of the characters. Most importantly,  they featured actual hockey being played as opposed to *Mallrats* (video game hockey) and *Dogma* (evil hockey kids getting beat up) that feature no actual hockey sticks hitting a puck. Thus, there needs to some variation of actual hockey being played onscreen.

**Answer: Yep. Hockey needs to be actually played.**

What should the budget be?

I know I keep going back to *Clerks* and *Chasing Amy* but they represent Kevin Smith at his best and have proven themselves to perfect examples of independent filmmaking. I’m thinking nowadays the best budget for a View Askew movie would be $5,000,000 because Smith can easily make the money back via VOD, Netflix, selling distributing rights overseas, or a touring roadshow (think *Red State*). When looking at his three View Askew movies that cost under five million at the time of release, (*Clerks, Chasing Amy, Clerks 2*) they all made money and were solid returns on investment. He couldn’t possibly keep the budgets as low as *Clerks* or *Chasing Amy* ($25,00, $230,000) but could totally rock a *Jay and Silent Bob* movie for five million.

**Answer: Somewhere around $5 million.**

There you have it! We all want another View Askew movie and this unreliable data will undoubtedly inspire Smith to make Mallrats 2, Clerks 3 and Jay and Silent Bob Get Old back-to-back. You are welcome world.

I know Smith tires of hearing about **Moose Jaws** but I'd love to see it. It would be cool if it was about a local sheriff (Sean William Scott) of a ski resort town trying to stop the money hungry mayor (Mike Myers) from opening up the ski resort to vacationers because of a man-eating moose.

9,"The Gerard Butler vs. space tornado fist-fight in Geostorm is 100% scientifically accurate. While looking back at my cinematic watching life I can only think of several moments that have legitimately blown my mind. Here they are:

1. Dolph Lundgren front kicking a massive ground worm into oblivion in Sandblaster
2. Kurt Russell surfing in Escape From L.A.
3. Kate Winslet's 47-minute drum solo in Whiplash 2
4. Sigourney Weaver nailing the behind the back basketball shot in Alien: Resurrection 

There is a moment in Geostorm that features Gerard Butler going toe-to-toe with a space tornado that blew my mind. When I left the empty theater I knew I had to research the scene for my collection of dumb data.  When I started digging into Geostorm I realized that the creators went out of their way to make it as realistic as possible and I couldn't believe how much effort went into researching and filming the space tornado fight. They hired physicists and space tornado experts and created actual space like conditions that worked perfectly within the multi-million dollar sets.  

Here is [the clip of the scene] (https://www.wired.com/2016/06/deep-blue-sea-celebration/) and a quick breakdown.

Gerard Butler is forced to go into space to stop the climate satellite (Dutch Boy) he created from destroying the world.  Before he can turn off the systems that are ""geostorming"" earth he has to put on a spacesuit and confront a dangerous space tornado that is moving towards the station at an alarming rate. Butler knows that the funnel-shaped clouds of charged particles carry around 100,000 amperes and can reach speeds of over a million miles per hour. Thus, after doing some calculations he learns that by propelling the right thruster on his suit to a magnitude of 7.6 gigolowatts he can create enough clockwise speed to stop the tornado which is moving counterclockwise. The problem is that somebody on the ""The Dutch Boy"" sabotaged Butler's suit before he left and only the left thruster works. This forces him to think quickly, and he flips himself upside down so his right thrusters propel his body counterclockwise at a speed of 250 spins per second. In the end, Butler manages to land ferocious right hooks that manage to change the directory of the tornado and safely guide it around the space station.

At first, I thought the scene was gobbledygook so I decided to break it down [(like I’ve done so many times)] (http://mentalfloss.com/article/58020/17-fun-facts-about-deep-blue-sea)  in an effort to figure out how it happened. After reading a lot of interviews and [science journals] (http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3399781/remembering-deep-blue-sea/) I learned that a space tornado could, in fact, take place around the orbit of the space station [(article here)] (http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/defense-deep-blue-sea/). Solar windstorms typically occur in earth's outer atmosphere (ionosphere) and responsible for the beautiful auroras that we see (Northern Lights). Also, since these storms are so electrically charged large conductors have been used by NASA to channel the electricity in satellites and space stations [(article here)] (https://youtu.be/gfXns_cU8I8). However, these tornados which occur frequently have been known to short-circuit satellites and disrupt GPS and cell signals [(article here)] (https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deep-blue-sea-1999). The crazy thing is Gerry Butler said all of this stuff in the movie and I disregarded it because I thought it was all nonsense. Geostorm is more Contact or Arrival than Armageddon.


When Butler learns of the storm and the timeframe needed to stop the tornados he creates a ""punching glove"" comprised of rubber, cloth and bent copper plating that would be used to conduct a magnetic field [(article here)] (https://youtu.be/BS8I9H07wKw) that wouldn't dissipate the energy of a storm (think head-on collision). What I appreciated most about his makeshift copper punching glove is how it worked as a magnetic conductor which pulled the storm away from the space station without causing it to suddenly halt the momentum which would be similar to a train hitting a massive concrete wall [(think Toledo 1973)] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6q3vx0/today_is_deep_blue_seas_18th_anniversary_here_are/). 

After watching the [(tornado punching clip)] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6adtem/after_a_fair_amount_of_research_calculations_and/) many times I was able to gauge the distance between The Dutch Boy and the oncoming tornado. If you look at the curvature and polarity of earth's surface in regards to the distance it's clear the storm was roughly 178 kilometers away from the massive space station when Gerry Butler went outside to fight it. Here is the math that leads me to this distance:

14(x)∅/37 (circumference) divided by 8* over GaryBusey47‰. = 178 Kilometers.

So, with his hindered jetpack going upside down Butler had 23 seconds to travel 3000 feet in order to get a punching angle on the storm. The math works because tornadoes move at a very quick speed of 7,000 MPH which works perfectly with the speed of Butler's jetpack and the angle he was traveling.

I was amazed to learn that director built a spinning a working recreation of the storm in a massive set in England. Using the largest studio in Pinewood [(pictures here)] (https://youtu.be/u_iwpplRyW8) they made a spinning system that mathematically worked with the trajectory of Butler's punching pattern. They actually put a stuntman upside down and worked out the process. When watching you will notice that Butler's stuntman isn't CGI during the upside punching. They spun him in the correct trajectory then used a technology called [""Super Spin”] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_Sea_(1999_film) to speed it up and make it look like he was spinning 250 times per second. It's no surprise they won the Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Production Design.

In the end, Gerry Butler saves the day via actual science and nobody expected it. I applaud Geostorm for its adherence to science and I hope people see it with new eyes now."
9,"I love it when Nic Cage runs amok while disguised as a bear in The Wicker Man remake. So, I mapped the island in an attempt to figure out how far he traveled while in the disguise. I love The Wicker Man remake because of its over-the-top acting and a once in a lifetime moment involving Nic Cage running amok in a bear suit.  Very rarely have movies confounded me like The Wicker Man and it has left me with several questions that I needed to answer.

1. How far does he travel while wearing the bear suit?
2. Where did he learn to fight? The dude knocks out three people and knocks down two people with six total strikes.
3. Could I map the island to learn how far he traveled?

I will never know how he learned to be such an efficient striker but I figured I could map the island and track his bear-suited movements. After watching the movie again I quickly realized that director Neil LaBute had no interest in making anything easy on me. The geography of the island is never 100% established and nothing makes geographical sense, but if you know my dumb data you know I try my best to combine all the clues to make an educated guess that is somewhere close to what is featured in the movie. There is no actual way to ever know how far Nic Cage traveled while dressed as a bear but the following is the best guess I was able to put together.

**Here are some assumptions that I have about the island:**

1. Nic Cage covers a lot of ground during his investigation. However, he never notices that they are building a massive statue that he will eventually burn in. Thus, the statue must be on the opposite side of the island because he has covered most of the coastal trails on the Lodge side of the island and had been to several homes/barns and a graveyard, old church, school, apothecary and a very large bee farm and witnessed nothing being built in a large field that is about 200 yards from the water (thanks, crane shot at the end).
2. After leaving Willow’s (his ex-who got him to the island) house he comes across some men loading wood onto a wagon. This means there is an adequate road system for transporting supplies via wagon. When we see the statue later those pieces of wood look very familiar. I love that they are collecting wood for the large wooden creation while Cage is running around like a maniac.
3. The island isn’t massive, but it is big enough to make bicycles a viable transportation option. However, there are no bicycles or houses in sight during the finale so it must be a remote part of the island.
4. In the time it takes for Cage to run from the cemetery to the Summerisle residence his once soaked clothes are now dry. This means the distance is at least two miles through trails and wooded terrain.
5. If the length of the island is over two miles and Cage’s journies took him relatively deep inland (up hills, through trails etc..) it makes sense that it would be at least one mile to the opposite side of the island.

**Here is what happened**

Towards the end of the movie, the island’s denizens start their journey to supposedly light a little girl on fire because they need a sacrifice for their crops. They start at Sister Summerisle’s (Ellen Burstyn) home and make their way inland through the bee maze and into a forested area. When they reach the forested trail, Nic Cage comes from the trees and meets up with his ex-fiance Willow (Kate Beahan). They finally stop at a forested area [where this happens.] (https://youtu.be/YyigAW-14w0)

**Where did Nic Cage come from?**

Nic Cage came from the lodge/bar that he was staying at while he was doing his illegal and loud investigation. The lodge is located centrally near the coast and is a solid base for everything that happens. Once he gets the bear suit on he runs up a hill and through the forest in an effort to meet up with the parade of cultists and Miss-bee-havers.


Because of the location of the Lodge in relation to where the cultists traveled I’m guessing Nic Cage had to travel 1800 yards (5400 feet) while dressed as a bear. How did I figure this out? Since he starts his journey on the coast he needs to move inland and over and down several hills and eventually cut off the roving group of honey lovers. Once he gets with them they travel for several hundred yards until they get to the burning site. He then runs about 50 yards to knock out an unsuspecting lady and rescue his “daughter” Rowan. They then run away into the woods where he takes off the bear suit. The distance covered is easily 1800 yards because he runs through the woods, travels along a trail, and eventually walked further with the parade before he made a final sprint to knock a lady out and run away with Rowan.


It’s impossible to know the exact number and I was initially  disappointed that I couldn’t factually say something like “Nic Cage ran two miles in 14 minutes while disguised in a bear suit.” However, I still love the fact that he traveled over a mile while dressed as a bear and I’m 100% certain that my incorrect guess is pretty close to the actual distance Nic Cage ran.

9,"Paterson (2016) and Columbus (2017) make for a solid doubleheader of films named after cities that are patient, intelligent and thoughtfully directed. I loved watching Paterson and Columbus. I appreciated the way in which the two cities were presented and the patient manner in which they told their stories. I've been so conditioned to thinking something massive is going to happen and I'm always pleasantly surprised when they don't. If you are looking for a relaxed and literate doubleheader I totally recommend Paterson and Columbus.

Directors Jim Jarmusch (Paterson, Coffee and Cigarettes, Only Lovers Left Alive) and Kogonada (Columbus, Fantastic Video Essays for Criterion etc...) do a fine job creating lived in worlds and showcasing the fantastic talents like John Cho, Haley Lu Richardson, Adam Driver and Golshifteh Farahani (she is the best).  I enjoyed every moment of the two movies. 

Patterson is currently streaming on Amazon Prime
Columbus is on Hulu

9,"I'm a big fan of the creature in It Follows. So, I watched the movie again in order to map its steps and I think it traveled 1,017 miles during the 15 days that it harassed the main character Jay. The creature from It Follows could become a Detroit tour guide when it gets tired of hunting down teenagers. It has probably covered every inch of the city and surrounding suburbs in its quest to murder its victims. In fact, not only does it know Detroit but it is familiar with the northern area of Michigan and has enjoyed a lot of the coastal areas as well.

In an effort to track the movements of the monster I searched for all the filming locations and have come up with an estimated travel total that I’m quite pleased with. Director David Robert Mitchell didn’t make it easy because there are moments during the film in which you have no idea where Jay was going or why it took about 14-hours to make a five-hour drive up North (I’m guessing sleep). However, after getting a feel for the locations and timeframe I know how far the creature traveled because the layout of the locations fit its movements.

**Here are some assumptions and timeframes I’ve come up with.**

1. The creature moves at a 20-minutes per mile pace and is always moving. Thus, the total for any 24 hour period is 72 miles.
2. Jay first becomes cursed around 9:00PM at night while at the abandoned Northville Psychiatric Hospital. This is when I’ve started clocking the miles of the monster
3. The film takes place over the course of 15 days. This may seem like a long time frame but the trip that our heroes take to a northern beach house in Whitefish Point in northern Michigan covers 10 of those days. I chose Whitefish Point because it is on the furthest tip of Michigan and the mileage works out almost perfectly when taking the speed of the monster into account. Also, the gang started their trip around 9:00PM and drove through the night and arrived at the beach house around 12:00PM. The total trip was around 15 hours so I’m assuming they slept, got supplies and had a long breakfast to cover the 15 hours. The total mileage is 702 miles (9.75 days walking).
4. I’m assuming that the creature always reroutes itself and follows the quickest route when its prey changes locations. Since it can’t just walk through homes I think it uses surface roads, alleys, and areas that aren’t fenced off to get to its prey.
5. The director David Robert Mitchell uses Detroit as a character so I’m going to use the filming locations as the actual locations in the story. The neat thing is they actually work really well in regards to the creature’s movements.

Below is a breakdown of the days and locations I know Jay visited. I could’ve easily just added up the hours and miles walked and called it a day, but I wanted to give you a feel for the creatures travels and show you the above assumptions make sense.

**Sidenote: There is a 0% chance of actually knowing how far the creature followed Jay.** However, since you won’t get an exact answer I wanted to make sure the timeline and math were correct to give you the best representation of the following.

1. **Day One 9:00PM – 12:00AM** – Jay becomes infected with the horrible curse at the abandoned Northville Psychiatric Hospital and is driven back to her house and eventually to the local hospital.
2. **Day Two**  –  Jay leaves the Hospital and goes home to get ready for school. She heads to the University of Detroit around 9:30AM where she first sees the creature. The timeframe works because it had about 12 hours to pinball around and make it to the school. During this time Jay covered 63 miles. However, since the creature didn’t have to walk those 63 miles due to its course correction, it makes sense that 12 hours would only be needed because the creature started towards the house/hospital and was able to course correct to the university which is only 17 miles away from the abandoned building.  After Jay runs away from the creature she goes to Clark’s Ice Cream and Yogurt then drives around for a while and goes home. 
3. **Day Three**  – Jay is still awake late at night (for good reason) when a window is smashed in and the creature comes after her. She runs to a park and meets up with the rest of the gang. From there they drive to an abandoned house, Clawson High School, Jeff’s home in Troy and eventually head to Jay’s house to pick up supplies and clothes. The gang then starts driving overnight to Whitefish Point. The creature is pinballing all day over Detroit and surrounding areas and because of this it never catches up to Jay (must be annoying). 
4. **Day Four**  – The crew posts up at a sweet Beach house. 
5. **Day Five** – Beach
6. **Day Six** – Beach
7. **Day Seven** – Beach
8. **Day Eight** – Beach
9. **Day Nine** – Beach – The creature finally gets to the beach after a 352-mile walk and it gets its hands on Jay. However, Jay escapes and the creature has to walk all the way back to Detroit. 
10. **Day Ten** – Hospital – She passes the curse over to Greg
11. **Day Eleven** – Hospital
12. **Day Twelve**– Hospital
13. **Day Thirteen** – Hospital – We know she has been in the hospital for three days because Greg mentions that “it’s been three days and there is nothing following me.”
14. **Day Fourteen** – Jay finally goes home and watches Greg get killed by the creature. She drives away and spends the night in some woods. 
15. **Day Fifteen** – Jay wakes up and walks toward a boat with some dudes in it. She then drives home and concocts a plan with her friends to kill the creature at a swimming pool that night around 11:45PM (the exterior for the pool is a different location than the interior. I’m sticking with the exterior location). I don’t want to spoil the rest because I’m not a jerk and there is some ambiguity.

**The creature walked 1,017 miles while hunting Jay.** I think this is a solid guess and the timeframe works if the following monster moves at the assumed pace.  I think this total makes it more frightening because the dang thing never stops and is always moving towards you at a leisurely pace in hopes of bending you up like a pretzel.

72 x 14 = 1,008 (14 full days). 3 x 3 = 9 (first day 9:00PM – 12:00AM). 1,008 + 9 = 1,017.

[Analyzing Nicholas Sparks Movie Poster] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7xj0wq/movies_adapted_from_nicholas_sparks_books_that/)"
9,"Movies adapted from Nicholas Sparks' books that don't feature good-looking people cuddling or a man grabbing a woman's head on their movie posters have higher averaged critic/audience scores and domestic box office numbers. Nicholas Spark’s book adaptations have become a moneymaking machine that combines well-known actors and a whole lot of melodrama. Sparks has become a brand and when you say it is a “Nicholas Sparks film” people know exactly what to expect.  What does it mean to be a Sparks film? The movie needs beaches, mudslides, drowning, ghosts, cancer, untimely death, spunky grandparents, cute kids and some sort of lie.  A pattern is afoot and I wanted to check if there is a correlation between the movie posters and box office/critical reception.

The following post takes a look at the posters and analyzes the box office, critical reception, and audience ratings of Nicholas Sparks films. The average inflated domestic box-office for all of the movies (per Box Office Mojo) is $67,222,736 and the average Rotten Tomatoes critic score is 24.6%. The thing I find most interesting is that they are critic-proof. The critic score is 24.6% but the audience score is 66% (Per RT). The average budget is $28 million and the average box office is $67 million dollars. However, things are changing and so are the movie posters.

**Here is the data from the movie posters**

**Posters featuring a man grabbing a woman's head:** *Nights in Rodanthe, Safe Haven, The Best of Me, The Last Song* and *The Lucky One* and have accrued an 18% RT score and 62% Audience score. The average box-office score is $61,307,960.

*Safe Haven* (12%), *The Lucky One* (20%), *The Best of Me* (8%) and *The Last Song* (20%) make up four of the five lowest critically rated films and they can get really weird. I don't want to spoil anything but there are ghosts, the awesome Diane Lane in mom jeans and untimely deaths that are really mean. Also, these movies have the lowest averaged audience score (62%) AND domestic box office. 


**Posters featuring good-looking people cuddling:** *Message in a bottle, Dear John, The Choice* and *Walk to Remember* have accrued a 24.75% RT  score and 65.25% Audience score. the box office average is $68,840,500).

The good thing according to [EW is they are some of the least ridiculous] (http://ew.com/gallery/nicholas-sparks-movies-how-ridiculous-are-they) of Sparks films. *Walk to Remember* is the least ridiculous while *Dear John* and *Message in a Bottle* rank six and three. An interesting fact is that only *The Choice* was produced by Sparks and it dropped the critic/audience/box office scores a lot. 

**Posters featuring something other than cuddles or head grabs:** *The Notebook* and *The Longest Ride* collected a 40.5% RT score and 78% Audience Score. The average box office is $79,845,400.

*The Notebook* is straight up beloved (and boosted the averages massively)  and *The Longest Ride* is much better than it had any right to be. Both screenplays were written by someone else and the directors George Tillman Jr. and Nick Cassavetes have done some very solid work in the past. These factors plus the posters prove that the best Nicholas Sparks films don't feature head grabs or cuddles on their posters. 

**Conclusion** - If you are going to watch a Nicholas Sparks film make sure the poster doesn't feature a guy grabbing a woman's head. 


In case you were wondering here is how I rank his films. 

1. A Walk to Remember
2. The Notebook
3. The Longest Ride
4. The Last Song
5. The Choice
6. Saf Haven
7. Message in a Bottle
8. Dear John
9. The Lucky One
10. Nights in Rodanthe
11. The Best of Me

9,"Zara the assistants' death in Jurassic World has stuck with me for a long time. So I decided to figure out the odds of her being picked up by two Pterosaurs, dropped into a lagoon and eaten by a Mosasaurus. Many people have been killed in the four Jurassic Park films. Whether it be getting smooshed by a Tyrannosaurus Rex or sideswiped by a clever Velociraptor we’ve been blessed with some gnarly dinosaur related deaths. The majority of the deaths have all happened somewhat organically due to the fact that on multiple occasions people been dumb enough to travel to islands filled with carnivorous monsters. Death is par for the course when battling dinosaurs and aside from Peter Stormare being dumb in The Lost World: Jurassic Park, I’ve never really felt that they were unnecessary or cruel. However, there is one death in Jurassic World that has garnered a lot of attention for being straight up mean [clip here] (https://youtu.be/LBTE3aH5gpw). The destruction of Zara the assistant (Katie McGrath – long live A Princess for Christmas)  via two Pterosaurs and a Mosasaurus is unique because she is the first women to be killed onscreen in the franchise, and it is a very long and brutal demise that is brought forth by her being forced to be a babysitter.

Zara’s death has gotten a lot of press and her character is even considered to be a hero to some [(Thanks Cracked!)] (http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-reasons-jurassic-world-brutally-killed-its-biggest-hero/). I kinda love that one death in a film stuffed with murder via dinosaur has stood out and become a lightning rod. That is why I watched the movie again, took a ton of notes and analyzed pretty much every diagram of the park. The reason I did so much research is that I wanted to know the odds of Zara’s death. I’m not here to hate on the film, or create something snarky in regards to Jurassic World. If you’ve read my other stuff you know I love filling in the blanks via educated guesswork, randomness and burning a lot of my free time.

**What are the odds that Zara the assistant would be picked up by two Pterosaurs, dumped into the massive lagoon, and swallowed whole by a Mosasaurus while at Jurassic World?**

As I tracked Zara’s progress through the park I originally came up with odds that were astronomical (1 in 300 billion). After a lot of soul-searching (via punch dancing in abandoned warehouses) I decided to go with a more pragmatic approach. I originally included divorce rates, square mileage, aviary destruction and stupidity in the equation. But, after talking to people who are much smarter than I am, I was able to narrow down the odds and get it to something that slightly resembles a believable number.

Here we go! 

Sidenote: There is no way to know the exact answer. However, I’ve tried to be as pragmatic as possible in an effort to make this number somewhat practical.

1. Jurassic World had been open for 10 years (all year round = 3,650 days) and they never had an animal escape.  – (**1 in 3,650**)

2. According to park numbers, there were 21,216 guests at the park.

3. I’m guessing that 150 Pterosaurs (and other flying beasts) escaped when the Indomnious Rex and helicopter crashed into the aviary. Let’s say one-in-three of the flying beasts (50) were big enough to pick up one of the guests, and that each one picked up one person (50 in 21,216 – **1 in 424**).

4. The majority of the guests had been pushed into the front area of the park. It is a very large area and I’m guessing half of the people were close to the massive lagoon that housed the Mosasaurus. **(1 in 2).**

5. If a large Pterosaur attacked you, the odds of it flying off with you alive or able to fight would be about **1 in 2.** I gave it those odds because there is an instance where the large flying beast landed on a guy and seemed to be destroying him on the ground.

6. After being grabbed by a Pterosaur, the odds of you fighting back would be 1 **in 2.**

7. If you were picked up close to the water you’d have a **1 in 2** chance of being dropped into the water.


The pragmatic odds of being at Jurassic World during a mass animal escape in which you are picked up by a Pterosaur and dropped into a Mosasaurus tank is **1 in 24,761,600 (3,650 x 424 x 16).** There had never been a large scale dinosaur escape in the 10 years the park had been open and nobody had ever been dropped into a large lagoon by a Pterosaur. Also, being that there are 20,000+ people, the odds of being singled out by the 50 attacking Pterosaurs was very slight. Also, I feel terrible for her because she ended up dead because she had to watch two punks while people willingly let out a dinosaur that had active camouflage.

**Here is what lead Zara to her death.**

1. She is forced to look after her bosses nephews because their parents are getting a divorce (She’s British…she will be great).
2. The nephews promptly run away from her leaving stressed out, worried and still having to do her day job.
3. Due to some very bad decisions, the Indomnius Rex is let out of its cage.
4. The nephews decide to ignore park warnings and stay out in the park in the moving bubble thing.
5. The Indomnius Rex is chased into a massive aviary holding very hungry flying creatures. The people in the helicopter essentially chased it into the aviary……
6. The nephews hotwire a car and drive back into the park via the west gate.
7. Zara collects the kids, and they run away from her which forces her to chase them.
8. The nephews stop in the middle of the carnage and Zara turns to see what they are doing.
9. A massive pterosaur picks her up and flies away with her.
10.Another pterosaur steals her away and flies toward the lagoon.
11. Poor Zara is dropped into the lagoon.
12. Pterosaurs dive into the water and one of them managed to lift her out of the water.
13. A Mosasaurus eats both Zara and the bird.
14. None of the main characters care.
15. I hope her fiance and parents get a massive settlement.

Conclusion - I feel terrible for Zara.

9,"The Kevin Costner vs. Sea Eater scene in Waterworld has always intrigued me. So, I decided to break down what happened after he killed it because there are a lot of variables to the scene. Kevin Costner killing the Sea Eater in Waterworld has long been a scene that I’ve been obsessed with. It has been featured in my [jet ski action scenes are the worst] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5ckqc0/movies_that_feature_jet_ski_action_scenes_have_an/), and [people getting swallowed whole and surviving] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6ipw4x/live_action_movies_that_feature_characters_being/) posts (it’s random I know).

The biggest problem I’ve always had is there is no way he would be able to stay attached the rope he was trolling on. Thus, his boat would sail away whilst he was trying to free himself from the innards of a giant monster. This means he would have to use his super swimming abilities to catch up with the boat, turn it around, and then cut the meat off of the sinking monster.

**Here is a breakdown of the scene.** [Clip here] (https://youtu.be/lZQF83kf-a4)

Costner (AKA Mariner…AKA Grumpy Costner) gets annoyed that the women on his boat are actively trying to feed themselves via fishing, so he grabs their fishing poles and throws them into the water. After throwing away his gear, he grabs some supplies (speargun, rope), turns on the boat’s trawling engine and jumps into the water (:46). Once the rope is fully extended he starts stroking the water gracefully in an effort to lure prey. Something underwater sees this display of graceful swimming (1:09) and thinks it has found dinner. The large beast surfaces and swallows Costner whole (1:20) and Costner ends up murdering the beast from the inside. Then, Costner cuts off roughly 100 (being generous) pounds of meat and three people feast.

**This scene left me with several questions:**

1. Why was it so easy to kill a monstrous sea beast?
2. Had he killed large creatures before?
3. Why did he throw away his fishing poles?
4. If large sea beasts are plentiful, why would people ride jet skis?
5. What happened after the death and before they ate?

After scouring the internet for data on the Sea Eater, I learned that people don’t know much about it (I got zero responses from people who read the novelization). I have nothing to go with in regards to the monster and Costner’s past hunting, so I decided those questions will be left unanswered. What I can fill in is what happens after the monster eats Costner and before they gorged on delicious looking meat.     

**Here is what we know so far:**

1. It took eight seconds for the 40-foot rope to become taught after Costner jumped into the water. This leads me to believe the boat was moving at a leisurely pace of 3.41 miles (2.96 knots) an hour.
2. He turned on his trawling motor before he jumped into the water. However, he didn’t use the cable attached to the winch on the back of his boat.
3. According to [kaiju.wikidot.com] (http://kaiju.wikidot.com/wiki:sea-eater) the Sea Eater is 40-feet long and weighs an estimated 20 tons.
4. During the [sea atoll attack earlier in the film] (https://youtu.be/orgbJEoA7ak), Costner covered 120-feet in eight seconds. That comes to 10.2 MPH which means the dude can fly in the water. I came to 10.2 MPH by finding a picture of the atoll, measuring the boat (60 feet long), and then measuring the distance from where he jumped.
5. Costner let go of the rope after the monster attacked. I know this because the boat would’ve stopped momentarily and the rope would’ve split in two if he held on. There is zero chance a tiny rope could withstand the force of a moving boat and a suddenly dead 20-ton monster.
6. Since there is no sign of salt or proper drying methods, I’m assuming Costner only took as much as he could carry for one or two meals maximum. This means that at least 39,900 pounds of sea eater meat was left behind for other hungry sea denizens.
7. It was dusk when they started eating the food. This makes sense because he had to heat up the charcoals and prep the food.
8. The scene reminds me of a Mitch Hedberg joke:

""On fishing shows, they catch a fish and let it go. They don't want to eat the fish, they just want to make it late for something. 

**Here is what happened after the monster was murdered:**

1. After watching various clips where people have to free themselves from dead/animatronic animals I’m guessing Costner (and his super powers) needed two minutes to free himself from the innards of the monster. It was clearly sinking, blood must’ve been everywhere and stomach lining is a beast to crawl through (not speaking from experience). He also had to secure his gun because he could not super swim with it.
2. By adding the original Costner/boat distance and time it took to free himself, secure his gun, and start swimming I’m thinking the boat was 715 feet ahead of him (40 + 600 + 50 +25 = 715).
3. The women on the boat must’ve been justifiably shocked as to what had transpired. So, in their shock the boat floated far enough away for them to not hear anything Costner might’ve shouted. We know Helen could steer the boat, but after the shock wore off, the process of turning the boat around would’ve been a beast of a job. I’m also guessing that Costner was still grumpy about losing his spear gun from earlier so he swam to the boat and did everything himself.
4. Knowing the creature was sinking, Costner started towards the boat, and since he could move at three times its speed he only needed 75 seconds of super swimming to catch up.
5. He turned the boat around and made his way back to the sea monster. He would’ve needed AT LEAST seven minutes to turn the boat around, travel back to the monster and anchor the boat. I’m guessing he was able to speed up the 1,840 foot return journey which would cut down the trip.
6. He dove down to catch the sinking beast. I don’t know anything about the floating tendencies of dead 20 ton monsters with holes in them, but it seems likely that it would sink because there is no way gasses could build up because of the massive holes in it.
7. He prepped the diving bell [(watch underwater Denver scene)] (https://youtu.be/YCQ6ADnxStI) and gathered supplies (five minutes) and dove to the bottom of the ocean to cut off some prime meat and potentially fist fight another creature (eight minutes). After watching various clips of chumming it’s evident that the majority of the stuff that exploded would’ve sunk by the time he returned.
8. He swam back up and put all of his gear back in place because he is particular like that (eight minutes).
9. The cooking started (30 minutes to heat grill, at least 30 minutes to heat massive meat steaks).
10. They ate!

**Conclusion**

After breaking down all the variables (known and unknown) the entire process before cooking everything would’ve taken AT LEAST 32.25 minutes because Costner had a lot to do before he could even start preparing the food. This may sound like a lot of time, but it’s not too bad when you consider the killing, swimming, boating, prepping gear, swimming, cutting, more swimming and putting away gear.

There you have it! The full breakdown of what happened after the killing and before the cooking. You can rest easy knowing that you will never have to spend another sleepless night thinking about what happened!

9,"2017 was a great year for movies featuring turtles, Jon Bernthal, and ghosts who shatter glassware 2017 was a very good year for cinema and I felt it was necessary to recap it with some random facts. I had a lot of fun surfing through the films because it reminded me of all the great coincidences, characters and random moments. 2017  featured great superhero cinema, solid ghost stories and Keanu Reeves destroying copious well-dressed villains. There are some movies that I will watch over and over (*Free Fire, Logan Logan Lucky, Baby Driver, Thor: Ragnarok*) or buy the moment they are released (Hello *Personal Shopper* Criterion Blu-ray).

**1. Movies featuring turtles/tortoises had an impressive year**

Turtles/tortoises were featured in several very good films this year in varying degrees. *The Beguiled, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, The Red Turtle, It, Lucky* and *Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2* all crushed their random turtle action

**2. Movies featuring ghosts who shatter glassware were fantastic**

*Personal Shopper* and *A Ghost Story* were two of my favorite 2017 films and the both featured ghosts breaking glassware.

**3. John Bernthal was in five fresh films** 

Jon Bernthal is the best and he was in some very good films this year. You should probably watch them all right now.

*Baby Driver* – 93%

*Shot Caller* – 74%

*Wind River* – 88%

*Sweet Virginia* – 76%

*Pilgrimage* – 69%


**4. Logan was the name to beat in 2017**

It’s really neat that both *Logan Lucky* and *Logan* have 93% Tomatometer averages. I loved each film and I hope *Logan Lucky* builds an audience because it is such a funny, nice and well made film.

**5. Korg defeated the Pentagon Papers**

We all know that rock loses to paper. However, *Thor: Raganrok’s* 92% Tomatometer score beat out Steven Speilberg’s The Post (87%). Korg is getting the last laugh.


**6. Wonder Woman is in the highest and lowest rated superhero films of 2017**

Between *Wonder Woman* (92%) and *Justice League* (40%) Gal Gadot had a roller coaster 2017. The good news is that *Wonder Woman* was so great that nobody cared that Justice League** kinda rewrote her character.

**7. Movies proving that space exploration is terrible had almost identical Tomatometer scores**

Space exploration seems terrible and movies that express that have almost identical scores. *Alien: Covenant* (68%) and *Life* (67%) both find very interesting and brutal ways to kill good-looking space explorers.

**8. Various types of “tailors” had a legit year** 

Very rarely have I been intrigued by onscreen tailors. However, *Guardians 2* (never seen but still a great tailor) and *John Wick 2* featured some tailors I really wanted to know more about.  Also, Daniel Day Lewis could make me an amazing suit in no time. His preparation for *Phantom Thread* was gnarly.

What random trends did you pick up? 

Sidenote: I was going to write about John Denver and Michael Stuhlbarg crushing it, but they've already been getting lots of press. So, I focused on lesser known stuff. "
9,"Hard Rain and Deep Rising were released in January 1998, and both featured indoor jet ski action scenes. The following figures out which of the movies better utilized their jet skis. No sooner is there an indoor jet ski chase in “Hard Rain” than there’s one in “Deep Rising.” - Roger Ebert, 1998

In January 1998, 20 years ago this month, *Hard Rain* (01/16) and *Deep Rising* (01/30) were released and had several things in common.

1. Critics really disliked them.
2. Water played a main role
3. They featured indoor jet ski action scenes that featured people driving through narrow corridors while being chased.

If you’ve been reading my stuff for sometime you know that I’ve long been a fan of analyzing [films that feature jet ski action scenes] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5ckqc0/movies_that_feature_jet_ski_action_scenes_have_an/). There is something intrinsically boring in how jet ski actions scenes play out because they just go in straight lines and people simply wipe out into water when they crash.  I love how the films that feature these scenes have an average Rotten Tomatoes score of 29%, and average $59 million domestically (inflated) on $82 million budgets.

The following post breaks down the indoor jet ski action scenes featured in *Hard Rain* and *Deep Rising* and award one of the with the **“Kenny Powers Jet Ski Action Scene Award.”** There are 10 categories and whichever film has the most points wins. If there is a tie, the film with the higher critic/audience average wins.

Here are the jet ski clips and some facts for each film.

**Hard Rain:**

1. Clip  - [here] (https://youtu.be/ZKTMxF2PrHM)
2. Tomatometer Average: 29%
3. IMDb score: 5.8
4. $70 million budget / $20 million domestic gross
5. Best Roger Ebert line from his [review] (https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hard-rain-1998):

""By the time we finally arrived at the story, I was essentially watching a documentary about wet actors at work.""

**Deep Rising**

1. Clip - [here] (https://youtu.be/_BZNxuqcCj4)
2. Tomatometer Average 31%
3. IMDb Score: 6.0
4. $50 million budget and $11 million domestic gross
5. Best Roger Ebert line from his [review] (https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deep-rising-1998):

""The owner of the ship (Anthony Heald) makes several speeches boasting about how stable it is; it can stay level even during a raging tempest. I wonder if those speeches were inserted after the filmmakers realized how phony their special effects look.""

**Here are the 10 categories and the points allotted**

1. Were the jet skis heavily featured in the marketing? (-1)
2. Did the jet skis outrun an explosion? (+1)
3. Which film represented indoor jet skiing more appropriately? (+1)
4. Did the characters think they looked awesome while riding? (-1)
5. Did the jet skis do anything other than go in a straight line? (+1)
6. Did the characters say something similar  to “YYYYEEEEAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH” while bursting through something? (+1)
7. Who started on the jet ski? The good guys or the bad guys? (+1 bad guys) (-1 good guys)
8. Do you think that somebody on set said “We gotta have more jet ski!” while filming? (-1 if “yes”)
9. Were the jet skis needed? (+1 if “yes”)
10. Were any of the characters featured in Goldeneye? (+1) - *The Spy Who Loved Me* kicked off a minor jet ski craze....


**Deep Rising – 1 point** (1,2,4,5,6,7 (-1), 8, 9, 10)

Treat Williams was acting like a motherf***ing boss on that jet ski and I never bought one second of it. The dude was flying around like a maniac and never had to worry about debris or smooshing into a wall. Also, the jet ski was featured on the movie poster and I 100% guarantee (zero proof) everyone on set was giving each other high fives when they were filming the indoor jet ski scene.  Thus, it can’t muster more than one point.


**Hard Rain – 6 points** (3, 5, 6, 7 (+1), 9, 10)

I appreciate that *Hard Rain* featured an indoor jet ski scene that was cumbersome, awkward and practical. Nobody looked cool, and whenever they had to turn it was a nightmare because of all the debris floating around. *Hard Rain* is not a good movie, but it respected us enough to realize that jet skiing around hallways would look dumb. I earnestly applaud you *Hard Rain* and I’m stoked you won the first annual **Kenny Powers Jet Ski Action Scene Award!**

9,"In an effort to figure out the lemon bowl mystery in National Treasure I went full Benjamin Gates to solve the riddle. In honor of the 13th anniversary of National Treasure, I decided to clear up (with educated guesswork) the infamous lemon mystery.  Why is a scene involving lemons infamous? Having lemons in a refrigerator is nothing groundbreaking or worthy of internet snark. It is the way the lemons are presented that has confounded audiences for well over a decade.  The issue the nitpickers have revolves around the lemons resting nicely in a big bowl in the middle of Jon Voight’s refrigerator.  It is a one-second scene in a two-hour movie that has joined the ranks of world-famous mysteries like Bigfoot, The Loch Ness Monster, and magnets.

[Watch the clip to get a feel for the scene] (https://youtu.be/WTA7KR9-9lM)

In my quest to be more like Benjamin Gates I’ve watched the scene over and over and did some lemon research to best guess why he had those lemons in a bowl in the middle of his refrigerator.

Here is how the scene plays out. Nic Cage and crew steal the Declaration of Independence in Washington D.C. and make their getaway to Philadelphia to hideout in Jon Voight’s house. They realize they need lemons for the declaration and the scene starts to take place.

**Here are the clues I’m working with:**

1. They start their drive from Washington D.C to Philadelphia well after sunset (7:30PM) around 9:00PM.

2. Mr. Voight has a sizable bar that looks to be loaded with cognac, gin and Irish whiskey. Also, to the left of the bar there is a decanter filled with a mystery booze.

3. If you look to the left of the characters during the clip you will see several glasses filled with iced tea and lemon.

4. When Harvey Keitel is at the house later on you will notice there is a half-filled iced-tea pitcher.

5. There is a bowl of apples and bananas in the same place where the iced tea glasses are

6. There is a massive library inside the house

7. Next to the apples and iced tea glasses there are poker chips.


**Here are the Benjamin Gates style deductions:**

1. They arrived in Philadelphia around 12:30AM which means a late night lemon pickup was pretty impractical. Also, the van they were driving in was being searched for so they would want to keep it off the road. This means the lemons had to be in the house.

2. Before they say “we need more lemons” they already have a cut up lemon in a tiny bowl. This means that they must’ve found the lemons in the refrigerator, taken them out of the bag and placed them in a bowl in the middle of the refrigerator. Nothing in his refrigerator looks organized, so I highly doubt that Voight would organize them in a bowl.

3. After looking at various retailer websites it seems that there are approximately ten lemons in a two pound bag that is commonly sold. Due to the contents of his fridge it seems clear that he would rather grab a bag of lemons then pick them individually. 
4. Due the contents of the refrigerator and the large pizza box I’m guessing that Voight rarely cooks. Thus, I don’t see him making lemon chicken or anything of the sort. Also, you won’t see him making any lemon cheesecake bars.

5. There were no lemons in Harvey’s iced tea. Thus, they were all used or Jon Voight straight up dissed Harvey.

6. The inclusion of poker chips means that Voight most likely has a weekly game with several of his friends. The lemons could easily be used with iced tea and various drinks.

**Lemon hot take:** After several discussions about the lemons I’ve learned there is a small group of people who believe Voight placed the lemons in the bowl himself. The reasoning is he decided to wash all the lemons at once instead of cleaning one at a time. After the cleaning he placed them in the bowl. This would make it easier for him to access. I think these people are delusional.

**Why were the lemons in the refrigerator?**

1. The loaded bar and empty contents of a wine bottle suggest that Jon Voight likes the occasional drink. I didn’t see any mixers in his bar or house so it looks as if he likes his booze neat or on the rocks. Lemon may seem like an odd garnish but it combines nicely with a whiskey hot toddy or gin/vodka tonics.

2. During the inspection of the declaration I’m deducing that Voight set them up with a nice pitcher of caffeinated iced tea. It was already late so they needed something cool and refreshing to keep them up. The fact that there are lemons inside the drinks show he is used to entertaining people (Poker) at his house and has no problem using lemons in their drinks/cocktails.

3. He has a massive library and since he is eating dinner at 12:00AM I’m assuming he likes to stay up late and read. Since he loves making iced tea,  he most likely enjoys brewing tea. Perhaps he likes to make lemon tea (needs half a lemon for squeezing) or cuts up a piece of lemon for his tea. The lemon has a nice detoxification element and helps with immune system building and digestion.

4. After researching lemon drinks in Philadelphia I found a treasure trove of articles talking about drinks and lemons. People love their iced tea, lemon shandys, and lemonade. Also, I managed an annual event in Philly and many of my volunteers could be seen with half gallon iced tea jugs from WaWa (they were obsessed). Thus, the dude loved his city and embraced drinks that could benefit from a lemon.

**Conclusion:** The lemons were already at the house and were most likely used for cocktail garnishes and iced/hot tea flavoring. They were in the middle of the refrigerator because Nic Cage pulled the lemons from the crisper and placed them in the bowl for easier future use. The mystery has been solved (or potentially creates more mysteries….)!

A Quick Pitch: If National Treasure 3 is ever made I think it should be about Nic Cage and crew rescuing a kidnapped Kurt Russell (dude is a national treasure).

9,"The Joker needed at least 65 minutes to lay out the knives, computers, cash wads, booze, onesies, roses, watches, glasses, tablets, guns, playing cards, grenades, and tchotchkes on the floor in Suicide Squad The visual of The Joker surrounded by knickknacks in Suicide Squad is an inspired one that says everything we need to know about the guy.

1. He likes to organize things.
2. He loves guns
3. He has a lot of watches
4. He is computer savvy because he figured out how to keep his tablets and computers from going into sleep mode.

When watching the film I couldn’t help but wonder who set all that up. I don’t think he would allow his henchmen to place the items because he seems like a control freak. So, I’m guessing that he put a list together and his henchmen had to gather everything from various places (storage, corner store, flower shop, black market, Best Buy).

Here is the list and time it took to place everything on the floor. It gives a pretty clear idea of what The Joker had to do. [clip here of weapon circle] (https://youtu.be/aq7bYP2Hv-Q)

Quick note: I put this list together via pausing the movie many times, looking at pictures on google and analyzing every angle of the eclectic setup. There may be a few missing items but I managed to piece together 475 individual items and figure out the placement via walking around my living room like a maniac.

Imagine that The Joker wrote this list on personalized stationery.

50 Knives and 1 Hammer – 4 minutes 

1 Captain Ron DVD – Just to Watch

164 wooden things (*AKA piano keys) – 5.5 minutes

10 Machine Guns – 1.5 minutes

35 Roses – 1.5 Minutes

2 Red Brawndos – Need Electrolytes and his thirst had to be 
mutilated

13 Bags – 1 minute

15 Watches – 1.5 minutes

2 Massive Machine Guns – 30 seconds

20 Cash Wads – 1 minute

12 Glasses (two six packs)- 1 minute

17 tablets – 20 minutes to place, find website page and switch to a non-sleeping mode

6 laptops – 10 minutes

1 Club Sandwich from great deli around the corner (tip well)

4 Onesies – 1 minute

3 Knives – 30 seconds

52 Joker Cards – 5 minutes

10 Grenades – 1 minute

37 little tchotchkes – 4 minutes

10 handguns – 2 minutes

1 New Clive Cussler book (Preferably NUMA files)

24 bottles of booze (4 boxes of six) – 2 minutes

After everything was collected and placed in easily totable bins The Joker set about placing everything. First, he had to lay on the floor to figure out the radius of the first circle (60 seconds). He started with the knives and worked his way out. Based on how many of the items he could hold at one time (or could be placed in bins) I retraced the steps very loosely and figured out he needed 65 minutes to set everything up. Since everything is organized and I’m guessing he had a plan that allowed him to work at a constant pace that was cautious and prevented double work. The biggest time suck was the configuration of the computers and tablets because he had to find a specific photo or website and make sure the computers didn’t go to sleep. I’m thinking he did this while watching Captain Ron in the background (see list for reference). 

There you have it! The Joker had a clear plan, made his henchmen buy/bring everything, and he set everything up in a direct and confident manner befit of a true madman. Director David Ayer obviously put a lot of thought into the circle and the plan was executed to time wasting perfection. 

**Ending Note:** I originally was going to attempt to figure out how The Joker was able to setup up the massive cash pile in The Dark Knight. My guess is that underneath all that cash is a wooden frame that allowed the henchmen to build the cash mound from the top to bottom. That would alleviate cranes and hours of stacking cash that had to be in nice and organized stacks.

9,"I finally watched Swimfan. I feel like I built it up too much in my head. It's been a long time coming in regards to watching Swimfan. I never watched it because I was pretty sure I knew exactly what would happen. 

Guy is a good swimmer. New girl likes swimmers. They have a fling despite the fact that he has a really nice girlfriend which makes him instantly unlikable. the ""Swimfan"" turns out to be a murderous insane person who hunts his family, friends, and girlfriend. She dies violently. Nu-metal plays over the credits.

However, after watching it I don't think she was actually a fan of swimming. I think she liked a swimmer. The entire venture feels like a waste of a great idea. The world never really gets movies about fans of swimming who are insane. Swimfan comes nowhere close to a Triple Lindy. "
9,"If the mall attacking motorcyclist would've been able to finish the blood pressure test in Dawn of the Dead I'm thinking it would be around 202/128. Dawn of the Dead is one of the greatest horror films ever made. George Romero’s zombie masterpiece was brutal, brilliant and timely. The film centers around four people securing themselves in a mall to protect themselves from zombie hordes. Once they secure the facility they find themselves in a cozy cove of consumerism and start going about their lives in relative peace. However, Their tranquility is interrupted when a bunch of bikers infiltrate the mall and run amok.

There is a moment that has always stuck with me. During the motorcycle carnage, a guy cheekily attempts to get his blood pressure tested and before we could see the results he is brutally murdered via dismemberment. The following post attempts to figure out what the guy’s blood pressure would’ve been had the test been allowed to be completed. [Clip here] (https://youtu.be/qcYV6-LgcKY)

**Warning:** I am not a medical professional. This post is purely speculative. I have done a lot of research but we’ll never know what this dude’s blood pressure would be. I just thought it would be funny.

Let’s assume the guy (let’s name him Charles “Chuck” Finley) started off with a totally normal blood pressure of 120 systolic/80 diastolic. Life was good for Chuck and he enjoyed a healthy lifestyle, relatively low stress and a rent-controlled apartment with a nice view. However, once the zombie outbreak happened his life became a chaotic mess that left him permanently stressed and dehydrated.  Eventually, he found himself joining a ravaging band of motorcyclists (the initiation was a beast) who thrive on death, chaos and terrible zombie battling tactics. Their scavaging lifestyle meant that water/sleep was scarce and canned goods/alcohol were plenty. Due to the constant threat of potentially becoming zombie food, the guy lived in a stressed-out state that left him irritable and paranoid.

During the mall attack, he found himself exerting a lot of energy and he makes a drunken(?) choice to test his blood pressure on a machine. However, due to the fact that he was in the middle of the melee, he gets straight up destroyed by hungry zombies.

Here are some important variables.

1. Lack of sleep
2. Dehydration
3. Alcohol consumption
4. Sodium-heavy diet
5. Physical exertion
6. Stress
7. Fear

With all of that in mind, I’m guessing (not an expert) that his blood pressure would be around 202/128.

The 202 systolic pressure is easy because Chuck is in the throngs of chaos and between the exercise, stress and physical exertion it’s easy to assume that 200 would be crossed. According to [multiple sources,] (http://www.newhealthguide.org/Blood-Pressure-During-Exercise.html) it’s possible for the range to be anywhere from 180 to 220.

128 diastolic is a little trickier because it doesn’t normally rise too much during exercise (sans heavy weight lifting). I’m thinking that the physical exertion (carrying around a mannequin = decent shoulder work out), fear, stress, [sodium-heavy food] (http://time.com/3623568/bpa-cans-blood-pressure/) and lack of sleep caused his blood vessels to constrict and heart rate to elevate.  Thus, when the action started the pressure had to be greater to push through the artery walls. The short bursts of sprinting, carrying of the mannequin and fear elevated Chuck’s diastolic to easily 128 during the melee.

There you have it! This totally speculative guess puts an age-old question to rest and hopefully brings you peace.

9,"I originally guessed that Michael Myers used his turn signal 57 times on his road trip in Halloween H20. However, after watching Halloween (1978) again I've learned that he has no regard for traffic laws and occasionally puts himself in positions where he has to run around station wagons. Back in May, I broke down the data on [Michael Myer’s Illinois to California road trip in Halloween H20: 20 Years Later.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6bicq9/after_researching_various_maps_1971_buick_skylark/) The trip had always fascinated me and I wanted to know how many times he had to refuel and use his turn signal. The idea of an evil murderer using his blinkers made me laugh and it lead to surmising that he used his blinker 57 times due to the route on Google maps. However, after rewatching the original Halloween (1978) I came across a startling discovery. The dude never uses his turn signal (cue semi-dramatic music) and puts in a lot of work to scare Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).

I know this is a stupid thing to harp on but if you’ve read my posts you know that I love tracking the deadly journeys that horror film characters embark on. I enjoy filling in the blanks and figuring out the intricacies of trips and giving the world something stupid to talk about. I had never considered covering Halloween (1978) before because director John Carpenter and writer/producer Debra Hill admitted that they were “kids” while working on the shoot and many of their one-off decisions (killing promiscuous people) have been given way too much thought. There is something pure about Halloween and that pureness was simply to scare audiences, keep them uneasy and have Michael Myers pop up everywhere at any moment.

What I love most about Halloween is how in Carpenter’s quest to make the audience “uneasy” he had Michael appear pretty much everywhere which meant he did a lot of walking, running, and hiding behind shrubs. The following post breaks down the various sightings and tracks his movements in three heading scratching scenes. This post is totally unnecessary but hopefully, it gives you a clearer idea into the movements of a famous fictional killer.

Before I get to the three scenes here is a very loose breakdown of Michael Myers movements throughout the film.

1. Steals a car
2. Kills a guy and steals his clothes
3. Arrives in Haddonfield
4. Finds childhood home
5. Pulls a large gravestone out of the ground
6. Robs a hardware store
7. Eats a dog? --  It's up for debate when he ate the dog.*
8. Spooks Laurie at school
9. Harasses a kid
10. Follows Laurie home
11. Drives around for like two hours
12. Hunts between the two houses and kills another dog….
13. Cuts two holes in a sheet and kills a lady.
14. Dies?

Here are the three instances where he appears to Laurie then has to make a quick getaway.

**1. Moment: Laurie sees Michael staring at her.**

**Where**: Laurie is in a classroom. Michael is standing across the street on the driver’s side of his vehicle.

**When:** 15:40 – 16:15

**How much time did he need to get away?** 15 seconds.

**How did he do it?** I tested this out in my driveway and there is no way he could’ve simply walked around the car and drove away. Michael literally had to run around the car, open the door, start the car and drive away. It is unclear whether the car was on or not. This doesn’t affect the fact that an evil shape had to run around the car to drive away.

**Random Thoughts:** There are a lot of variables to this scene. The only thing that never changes is that Michael had to run around the car. How did Michael find her? What happens if Laurie looks back to the street faster? How did he time it so perfectly? We do know that she actually saw Michael and it wasn’t a vision (confirmed on 35th anniversary Blu-ray commentary by Carpenter). In those 15 seconds, he had to do more than saunter which I think is pretty awesome.

**2. Moment: Laurie sees Michael standing next to some hedges.**
[Here is the Youtube clip for 2 & 3 in this list] (https://youtu.be/jXrhObXq42o)

**Where:** She is walking home from school. Michael is chilling.

**When:** 23:41

**How much time did he need to get away?:** 26 seconds

**How did he get away?:** He walked around the back of the house and stopped when he got to the clothesline behind Laurie’s house. It’s doable. 

**Random Thoughts:** This moment takes place after Michael slams on the station wagon brakes when yells “Speed kills!” at him. So, he parked the station wagon on the street, ran 200 feet to some hedges (counted their steps) and waited till they came up the sidewalk. I love that Michael must’ve been peering through a crack in the hedges until it was safe to step out. Having Michael play peekaboo with Laurie adds another dimension to the character. He starts to come across as a cheeky/evil fellow who enjoys messing with babysitters. 


**3. Moment: Laurie sees Michael hanging around some clotheslines**.

**Where:** Laurie is at her house. Michael is hanging out by a clothesline.

**When:** 26:36

**How much time did he need to get away?:** Zero seconds because Laurie is looking at him the entire time.

**How did he get away:** I’m assuming he waited for a perfect wind to push the sheets up so he could walk into a wooded area.

**Random Thoughts:** This is the toughest appearance to break down because it happens so quick. I am assuming it happened (per Carpenter) so I’m taking the escape at face value. Logic suggests that Michael sidestepped into the surrounding foliage. However, I’d like to think that he did a quick somersault and propelled himself into the wooded area. That would be awesome!

There you have it! Michael Myers covered a lot of ground and potentially did a somersault to escape Laurie’s view. Hopefully, this post fills in some blanks and lets you know that Michael put in a lot of work during his Halloween hunting!

9,"I am 91.782% certain this selection of streaming horror films/thrillers will help you pick a movie to watch on Halloween. The world is inundated with lists telling you which horror films to watch on Halloween. I’m sure they all have their merits but they aren’t looking out for everybody. I wanted to bring you a wide variety of films in order to give you options. I understand that not everybody watches the same kind of movies so options are always nice.

I came up with 16 categories and in those categories, I’ve given you the main option and a backup in case you don’t like the first recommendation. Hopefully, you can find something you will enjoy. An added bonus is that all of these films are streaming on either Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, HBO GO or Shudder.

**If you are in the mood for…..**

**1. Fast Zombies on a Fast Train**

*Train to Busan* (Netflix) –  Train to Busan is a fantastic horror film that involves fast zombies, lots of blood and people trying to run up escalators that are going down (it's terrifying). It helped 2016 become the highest rated year for horror [(according to RT)] (https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/what-was-the-best-year-ever-for-horror/) and you will love the new spin on zombies. 

**If you aren’t interested.** *Night of the Living Dead* (Amazone Prime, Shudder) – George Romero is the best. 


**2. Quite Possibly the Most Stressful Experience Ever**

*The Texas Chainsaw Massacre* (Amazon Prime) – This film is an absolute classic that is primal, horrifying and beautifully made. If you are looking to be stressed out you need to watch this classic. 


**If you aren’t interested:** *Rosemary’s Baby* – The two films are incredibly different but they do a great job of building suspense and ending on some truly memorable shots. 



**3. Genetically Modified Sharks Running Amok**

*Deep Blue Sea* (Netflix) – Deep Blue Sea is the Citizen Kane of genetically modified shark movies. If you've been following me for a while you know that I love writing about it and figuring out the logistics to all the deaths. 


**If you aren’t interested:** *Grabbers* (Hulu – Shudder) – Drunk Irish Villagers battle aliens. Grabbers is really ridiculously fun. 


**4. A Whole Lot of Cannibalism**

*Raw* (Netflix) – Raw is a fantastic little thing that features lots of blood, dark humor and tension. You kinda need to watch it. 

**If you aren’t interested:** *The Silence of the Lambs* (Hulu) – These two films feel right together. 


**5. A killer who doesn’t have a lame backstory**

*Hush* (Netflix) – Hush is a fantastic horror film that does a lot with little and Netflix should be stoked they are streaming it exclusively. I love the film because it plays very practically and features a nameless villain that doesn’t need a backstory or motives. Hush is smart, exciting, and wonderfully simple.

**If you aren’t interested:** *It Follows* (Netflix) – What I love about It Follows is how it is loaded with mystery, patience, and dread. It never stops and it keeps you in a constant state of alert because you don’t know where the following creature will pop up next. That is perfect for Halloween horror!


**6. A Vampire mockumentary that is big on blood and humor**

*What We Do in the Shadows* (Amazon Prime) – “We are werewolves, not swearwolves.” You need to watch this film about cheeky vampires who deal with all sorts of cheeky problems.

**If you aren’t interested:** *Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon* (Shudder)is a cheeky/violent mockumentary that focuses on a budding serial killer who lives in the same world as Freddy, Jason and leatherface.

**7. John Goodman being Awesome**

*10 Cloverfield Lane* (Amazon Prime) - 10 Cloverfield Lane is a terrifying chamber thriller that features career-best performances from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman. It manages to do a lot with little and proves horror films don’t need masked killers or insane violence to be tense. I really hope that John Goodman wins a retroactive Academy Award because he is perfect in the movie.

**If you aren’t interested:** *Honeymoon* (Netflix) – The two films are different but I love how Honeymoon establishes dread and features bad things happening to likable people. 

**8. The Worst Band Gig Ever**

*Green Room* (Amazon Prime) – Green Room proves that director Jeremy Saulnier (Blue Ruin) is an amazing director. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and I love how Saulnier makes violence look so ugly and realistic. Nothing is glorified and you will find yourself incredibly nervous for the trapped punk band. Also, Patrick Stewart is awesome as the Neo-Nazi leader because he looks like your nice uncle but he would kill you without a thought. Please watch Green Room.

**If you aren’t interested:** [*Interior*] (https://www.interiormovie.com/) (Amazon Prime) – This $15,000 micro-budgeted horror film is a blast and director Zach Beckler made a movie that hits above its weight. Let it build to its fantastic conclusion and embrace the jump scares. 

**9. A Patient Horror Film That Builds to Something Awesome**

*The Blackcoat's Daughter* (Amazon Prime) – The Blackcoat’s Daughter is a slow-burning horror film that builds to something pretty great. I feel like the entire film is based upon one line and as the film progresses it all begins to make sense. It is very simple and effective in its violence, plotting and shock value. In the end, I was pleasantly surprised at the mayhem that had just unfolded in front of me. First-time director/writer Oz Perkins should be applauded for creating a lot with little.

**If you aren’t interested:** *The Devil's Candy* (Netflix) – The Devil's Candy is a mean little thing that features a great performance from Ethan Embry.

**10. A Lady Having a Very Bad Day** 

*Gerald's Game* (Netflix) – Director Mike Flannagan (Hush, Oculus) was finally allowed to make his dream project and he did not disappoint. This is a rare Stephen King adaptation that compliments the source material and Carla Gugino crushes it. I love this film. 

**If you aren’t interested:** *Tusk* (Amazon Prime) – Tusk is weird, however, that is why I kinda love it. Kevin Smith really tried to make a solid horror film and he succeeded. 


**11. A Single Location Horror Film** 

*Pontypool* (Netflix, Shudder) – I still can’t believe how much I loved this movie. It features four people, lots of talking and very effective creeps. It is inventive and fun.

**If you aren’t interested:** *[Rec]* (Shudder) – [Rec] is insane and also features creative almost single location zombie antics. 


**12. A Western Horror Film**

*Bone Tomahawk* (Amazon Prime) – Bone Tomahawk is a beautifully written horror western that plays with multiple genres while creating memorable characters. It takes its time getting to the violence and I applaud that decision. I understand why it has stayed on the fringes of the mainstream because it can’t be categorized and features lots of patience and extreme body mutilation.

**If you aren’t interested:** *Carnage Park* (Netflix) – Mickey Keating always brings the goods and this thriller is bonkers. I am a big fan of actor Pat Healy (Cheap Thrills, Starry Eyes, Small Crimes) and it is cool seeing him go so unhinged.

**13. A Cheeky Modern Vampire Film**

*Fright Night* (Shudder) - Fright Night jumpstarted the modern vampire craze and features some truly inspired acting and special effects. 

**If you aren’t interested:** *Let the Right One In* (Shudder - Hulu) – Let the Right One In is the rare horror film that transcends the genre because every element of it is great. It is beloved by critics and horror hounds because it tells a heartbreaking story while featuring lots and lots of blood. You won’t find a better vampire movie out there because there aren’t any.

**14. A Dinner Party Gone Awry**

*The Invitation* (Netflix) – The Invitation tells the story of a dinner party gone awry. It is patient, chilling and features the best horror ending of 2016. Director Karyn Kusama does a great job building to an unforgettable climax that will make your head explode (not really). You need to watch The Invitation because it is unexpected, tense, chilling, and features some great beards.

**If you aren’t interested:** *The Loved Ones* (Hulu) – The Loved Ones is awesome and it kinda features a dinner party gone awry. It gets very bloody

**15. Adam Scott Bonding With the Anti-Christ**

*Little Evil* (Netflix) – Little Evil is an endearing little thing that plays fast and loose with The Omen references. Director Eli Craig (Tucker & Dale vs. Evil)  is a horror comedy maestro who is somehow able to find heart amongst brutal death. 

**If you aren’t interested:** *Tucker & Dale vs. Evil* (Shudder, Netflix) – T&D is horror comedy at its best and I love how it successfully subverts the genre while bringing the gore.

**16. A descent into Korean madness**

*The Wailing* (Netflix) – The Wailing is insane. It is a totally engrossing experience that puts you through the wringer and leaves you feeling tired and kinda gross.

**If you aren’t interested:** *A Tale of Two Sisters* (Shudder) – Embrace the Korean weirdness. You will love it."
9,"After analyzing the dimensions of the disco lounge and surface area of the SS Lazarus I've deduced that Jason Voorhees had no need for teleportation in Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan With Friday the 13th upon us I wanted to take a deep/dumb dive into whether or not Jason Voorhees can teleport in Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan. Breaking down his movements have been my toughest test thus far, but since I’ve already covered Leatherface, Michael Myers, the Fisherman in I Know What You Did Last Summer and the sharks in Deep Blue Sea, it felt only natural to tackle the wonky movements of Jason Voorhees. 

I’ve [read a lot] (http://forum.f13game.com/index.php?/topic/1641-can-jason-actually-teleport/) about Jason Voorhees teleporting tendencies and I’ve learned the Friday the 13th community is torn on the subject. Is he really fast or can he teleport? I see both sides of the argument but after watching way too many [clips] (https://youtu.be/IjneUkmxIJk) and [documentaries] (https://youtu.be/KbpfevvgDds) I’m convinced that Jason is an incredibly gifted athlete who capitalizes on dumb decisions. If that dude could really teleport he would be an absolute nightmare that only Hayden Christensen and Samuel L. Jackson could defeat.

The following post posits the idea that Kane Hodder’s Jason is a physically gifted reincarnation of a once lumbering monster and his quick movements work in the context of a very stupid film (which I love). If he can [punch a man’s head off] (https://youtu.be/B9Ewb3MojAs)  he can easily take shortcuts, work angles and take advantage of people who have zero tactical awareness. The scene I want to break down is the infamous dance floor murder scene.

There are other moments that involve “teleporting” but I wanted to get to the bottom of the dance floor death because it is a tricky beast. Here are some observations about the scene.

1. The victim Eva is a tacticians nightmare
2. I think her shocked reactions come from fear and the fact that a large man is sprinting unnecessarily from point to point
3. Jason doesn’t really move that far
4. He had plenty of time to saunter up behind Eva before he throttles her.

Here is a breakdown of the scene. [Clip here.] (https://youtu.be/hO_Q3AVEIJc)

Eva is being chased by Jason and she runs into a circular disco room. She gets to the middle of the room in four seconds and covers about 21 feet in the process (:48).  She runs around the room for 12 seconds and we learn that the lounge is a circular room with multiple doors leading into it (they are all locked of course).

Jason storms into the dance room whilst Eva is standing in the middle of the room (1:02). She runs around for 15 seconds find herself back in the middle where she notices Jason has moved roughly 12-15 feet to his left (1:18). She gets all crazy-eyed and Jason has three seconds to move 10-12 feet to his right (1:23).

This is where tracking his movements gets tough. Jason then has three seconds to move back to where he just came from (still possible for an athletic immortal. Also, I measured it and I covered the distance in three seconds). Eva then looks away for four seconds and when she looks back Jason is nowhere to be seen (1:32). I’m guessing he is behind the truss which is kinda weird because it’s unnecessary. Then, Eva looks around for 19 seconds and Jason slowly saunters up and grabs her by the throat. This is the most believable moment because Eva LITERALLY looks away from the place where he had to be!

This whole scenario had to be incredibly terrifying and weird for poor Eva. She got locked in a disco lounge on a boat and had to watch as a  large man did short sprints in the corner. No wonder she was totally paralyzed and couldn’t leave the dance floor. This isn’t a case of teleporting. It’s a case of a large man confusing and terrifying a young lady who wasn’t equipped to deal with the situation.

If you were wondering about the other “teleporting” instances here is what I think happened.

1. The Building Throw – Professor Charles Drown ran up one staircase while Jason entered the adjacent staircase out of frame. Since he is so fast he easily beat the slow-moving professor up the stairs. After Jason throws him through the window he runs back down the stairs and finishes the job eight seconds later. Is he fast? Yes. It is impossible? Nope. [Here is the clip.] (https://youtu.be/Za5G3rgIP4E)

2. The Boat Incident – What happens here is Miles is attacked by Jason, so he descends a ladder to the main level while Jason takes the quicker stair route. Jason corners him at the front of the boat so Miles decides to climb a ladder. Miles has a headstart up the ladder but he slows down as he gets higher. So, Jason has seven seconds to climb quickly up the ladder to surprise his prey. This variation of Jason could totally do that. [Here is the clip.] (https://youtu.be/M-s8uzpZppk)

[How Long Does it Take Horror Villains to Travel From NYC to San Francisco] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6xe3ra/after_analyzing_hiking_trails_gas_stops_and_how/)"
9,"After analyzing hiking trails, gas stops and how long it would take to hire a private jet I've figured out which villains could make it from NYC to San Francisco the fastest Have you ever stayed awake at night and wondered how long the creature from *It Follows* would need to catch Jessie and Celine during their *Before Sunrise* adventure? I sure have. Since writing a post about that would be kinda insane I decided to find out which horror villains could make the trip from New York City to San Francisco (2.927 driving, 2,923 walking, 6-hour flight) the quickest.

Here is the setup. An unfortunate soul annoys the villains while at JFK Airport (or in the case of Jaws, beforehand). The person flies to San Francisco and the villains decide to see who can make it the fastest.

I decided to leave Freddy Kreuger (Nightmare on Elm Street), Pinhead (Hellraiser), Candyman (Candyman), Azazel (Fallen) and The Red Lipstick Demon (Insidious) out of it because it would be too easy for them. They can get you wherever you are via evil wizardry and they wouldn’t need to hitchhike, swim across continents or walk massive distances. I also didn’t want to be redundant so I’ve left out multiple villains because their journey would be too similar to others.

Finally, I didn’t think certain villains would have a chance to make a cross country trip. For example:

**Stripe (Gremlins)** – If a gremlin made a cross country trip it would end with a gremlin apocalypse.

**The Firefly Family (Devil’s Rejects)** – They would just kill people at every pit stop and eventually get shot.

**The Exorcist demon** – It just chills in bed.

**Ghostface (Scream(s))** – Ghostface is way too clumsy and would get into too many accidents

**The Hills Have Eyes** folk – If they ever made a trip to NYC they wouldn’t leave because it took too long to save up.
 

 
**Crawlers – (The Descent)**

Total time: 132.8 days

*The Descent* is one of my favorite horror films so I had to add the subterranean murder machines into the mix. The only problem is that they have to travel at night and during this time of the year, they’d only have 6.5 hours of travel time (5.5 moving + 1 for hour eating) because they would need to find a comfy place to not get sunburned and find things to eat. I think they could cover four miles an hour (caves aren’t great for cardio) and total 22 miles a day.


**The Saw Tricycle Puppet (Saw)**

Total Time: 71.21 Days

Let’s say that somehow the puppet from *Saw* came alive and decided to chase somebody cross country on a tricycle. I’m assuming the possessed creature doesn’t sleep, therefore if it moves at the very slow pace of 41.1 miles a day (35 minute-mile because of slow uphill time) and most certainly annoys many drivers. Normally, I’d assume that tricycles can go much faster. However, [after watching clips] (https://youtu.be/BP4BtZDad6c) the thing is never in a hurry and is not very mobile, so I feel good predicting the snail’s pace.



**Jason Voorhees (Friday the 13th)**

Total time: 41.31 Days

Jason Voorhees moves very slowly but he would never stop to eat or sleep. The only problem is he would make a quick stop at Camp Crystal Lake in New Jersey (70.8 miles) then head to San Francisco (2,904 miles).  Thus, if he sauntered at a leisurely 20-minute mile pace, spent a day killing campers, and didn’t end up in outer space he would make it to San Francisco in a respectful 41 days.


**Graboid (Tremors)**

Total time: 33.81 Days

Let’s forgo the logical and just pretend that a Graboid was in New York City and somebody pissed it off. It would take a good amount of time for a 20-foot creature to navigate through the concrete jungle and make its way to the massive hiking trail in Washington D.C. called the American Discovery Trail (238 miles). From there I believe the creature could move along the 4,834-mile trail at a pretty decent speed and average 15 miles per hour for 10 hours a day. There will be some obstacles but if the creature can trick humans then I think it could navigate the occasional concrete wall.

**Jaw’s nephew? (Jaws 4: The Revenge)**

Total time: 17.3 Days

If the shark moves at the same speed that it did in *Jaws 4: The Revenge* (16.58 miles per hour) then it could cover the 6,900-mile trip pretty quickly. I’m assuming it wouldn’t take too much time off, and sleep wouldn’t happen. The only stops it would make are for a quick bite of fisherman, salmon or scuba tanks.


**Critters (Critters)**

Total time – 16.2 days

Imagine sitting at a stop light and [seeing a ball of critters] (https://youtu.be/W87r406zC3c) rolling past you at 18 MPH. Here is how I see the critters journey playing out. The critters would form a massive ball of death and roll for 10 hours a day at 18 MPH. They would need some sleeping time and when they disband from the ball I bet it would take forever to organize them back into the sphere of death. If they were more organized they would make better time but in the end, they would make 180 miles per day.


**The Blob (The Blob)**

Total Time – 6 days

The Blob’s journey is very straightforward. It would move at a maximum of 20 MPH and have no need to slow down for prey. It would just roll over pedestrians and have plenty of chances to fuel itself.

**The Wicked Witch (The Wizard of Oz)**

Total time – 4.17 Days 

Based on her flying past the tower (40 feet) in [one second in this clip] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pS_gJPJzhU) I’m assuming her eventual max speed is 50 MPH. The biggest problem is riding on a broom for a long period of time would be terrible. Thus, for every hour she needs at least 10 minutes of stretching. Add sleep (6), back stretch breaks (3 hours) and meals (1 hour) and she impressively is able to sit on a broom for 14 hours day. 

**Michael Myers (Halloween)**

Total Time: 2.5 Days

I’ve already established that Michael Myers is a pro at driving cross country. The guy can drive like the wind and has no problem refilling his gas tank even though he has no money. The biggest issue he would have is making the 13 refueling stops along the way, It will take about an hour each time because he can’t simply pull up to a gas pump and refuel. The dude needs to steal gasoline and that is time-consuming. Thus, it takes him a lot longer than it should to drive cross country even at an average speed of 65 miles per hour.


**The Thing (The Thing)**

Total time – 13 hours

What this all boils down to is how fast The Thing can assimilate into somebody else. It would need to scout people going to San Francisco (1 hour),  assimilate into that person (1 hour) and board a flight across the country (3 hours). After the six hour flight, I’m thinking the creature would need two hours to find a cab and make its way to the unwitting victim.

**Danica Talos (Blade: Trinity)**

Total time: 10 hours

Parker Posey was awesome in *Blade: Trinity* and I included her so I could write more about her under-appreciated character. Vampires in the Blade world are rich, which means she could hire a private jet (2 hours), make the flight (6 hours) and step into a limo waiting for her at the airport. She wouldn’t have a problem traveling during the day (light protector yada yada yada) so there is no worry of dying from lots of San Francisco light.

9,"Movies that feature JCVD doing 3+ splits have a higher averaged RT/IMDb score (56.25) than movies that feature him doing two (50.5) or one/zero (38.6) Does the number of splits in a film impact critical and audience scores? If the star of the film is Jean-Claude Van Damme the answer is “yes.” JCVD is known for his splits and he’s gone to some pretty far lengths to [stay relevant in the split world] (https://youtu.be/M7FIvfx5J10). 

I collected the audience (IMDb)/critic (Rotten Tomatoes) data for JCVD’s theatrically distributed films and I’ve discovered something that will shake the foundations of everything we know (probably not). There aren’t that many splits featured throughout JCVD’s cinematic catalog. When thinking about his career I’d just falsely assumed he did splits in every single fight scene. However, after watching way too many clips and reviewing his movies I realized I’m remembering his movies all wrong.  I’d like to thank [Grantland] (http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/crotchsport-the-15-greatest-splits-of-jean-claude-van-damme/) (RIP), [WatchMojo] (https://youtu.be/sPp6gafspTM) and [Youtube] (https://youtu.be/ONB5n0cPDaw) for aiding me in my research.

Before we get any further I want everyone to know that I left out spinning split kicks and kicks where JCVD is kinda splitting. The splits I included are splits that were thrown into the film because JCVD is awesome at splits. The selected splits are all gratuitous and often result in ball punches and other things that hurt.

I also decided to leave out his direct-to-DVD films (sorry *Replicant*) because I only have so much free time and aside from the latest *Universal Soldier* (They are awesome!) movies I don’t think my soul could take it.

Here are the films that are included in the data set:

*Bloodsport, Kickboxer, Timecop, Double Team, Cyborg, Double Impact, No Retreat, No Surrender, Street Fighter, Universal Soldier, Universal Soldier: The Return, Maximum Risk, The Quest, Nowhere to Run, Death Warrant, Sudden Death, Hard Target, Lionheart*

Here are the averaged RT critic and IMDb user scores according to splits.

**0 – 1 splits – 38.6%** (Double Team, Cyborg, Double Impact, No Retreat, No Surrender, Street Fighter, Universal Soldier, Universal Soldier: The Return, Maximum Risk, The Quest, Nowhere to Run, Death Warrant, Sudden Death, Hard Target, Lionheart) – There weren’t critic scores for Death Warrant or No Retreat, No Surrender so I averaged the RT score for 0-1 splits movie (25%) and made those the scores.

**2 splits – 50.5%** (Timecop)

**3+ splits – 56.25%** (Bloodsport, Kickboxer)

The majority of JCVD’s films fall in the 0-1 split category. I assumed he did at least 7,000 splits in each film and was taken aback when I realized there was a  dearth of splits in most of his movies. However, the three films where he does multiple splits *Kickboxer* (7), *Bloodsport* (7) and *Timecop* (2) are in the top five of his highest rated films.

1. Kickboxer – 62
2. Hard Target – 55.5
3. Sudden Death – 55
4. Timecop – 50.5
5. Bloodsport  – 50.5

Bloodsport and Kickboxer are B-movie classics that feature copious montages, solid fights, and villains who have terrible game plans. They also feature a bonkers [(listen to the HDTGM folks talk about JCVD’s films)] (http://www.earwolf.com/episode/timecop-live/) amount of splits that are straight up gratuitous. When thinking about the splits of JCVD I’d say *Bloodsport, Timecop* and *Kickboxer* will come up first. When you ask people about [Hard Target] (https://youtu.be/oLnrsZa4EqQ) they are quick to bring up snake punching and mullets. When you bring up [Sudden Death] (https://youtu.be/qFprLPWDd-Y) people talk about the insane kitchen fight.

I really didn’t know what to expect from the data but I think it’s credible. *Bloodsport* and *Kickboxer* focus on his strengths and don’t give a crap about the plot, saddling him with kids or giving him a twin. They also have the added luxury of coming out first and introduced the world to gratuitous split moments before they were cool (thus they made him cool). Future JCVD films like *The Quest* and *Lionheart* mimicked the tournament/revenge plots with much less skill and splits for some reason.

There you have it! The more JCVD splits the better!  If you liked this post make sure to check out my other random data analysis musings that I put on Reddit.

9,"Matthew McConaughey broke every long jump record in Reign of Fire *Reign of Fire* is a relatively grounded post-apocalyptic dragon film that features an incredibly odd moment that has stuck with me for years. In an effort to make Matthew McConaughey look awesome they had him do a leap that breaks all forms of movie logic and left many people confused or amused. If you’ve been reading my random analysis posts you know I love finding answers to movie moments/scenes that confound me. These moments weren’t created to be analyzed or broken down and I know little thought was put into them. However, in these careless moments, I’ve discovered pure gold and I love figuring out things that don’t need answers.

**Sidenote:** I love *Reign of Fire*. It’s one of my favorite “when it’s on, I watch it” movies and I’m writing this out of love, not pithiness.

One scene that I’ve never been able to shake is featured in Reign of Fire. [Here it is] (https://youtu.be/5pqdHkgdXr0)

Watch it again and take a look at how far McConaughey is able to jump. He spends seven seconds in the air and never descends! Normally, I’d watch this scene and never think about it again. However, some things happened that left me with questions I’d never thought I’d have.

1. How could he stay in the air for seven seconds without descending?
2. What was his plan? If he killed the dragon how did he plan on surviving? Was it an unnecessary suicide mission?
3. If he played cat-and-mouse with more strategy wouldn’t it keep the dragon preoccupied longer?
4. How much does the axe weigh?
5. How strong are his quads?
6. Do we quickly evolve after the apocalypse to become better jumpers?

Normally when a hero sacrifices their life they do something heroic before they die in a glorious ball of death (Think *Pacific Rim*). McC got off to a great start with the leap but everything went wrong after that. At first, I was like “He might kill a dragon!” Then after a few seconds, I was  like “Wait, did that just happen?”  This isn’t *The Last Witch Hunter* where Vin Diesel jumps through a bone creature easily and without a scratch. This is a film where the attack plays out exactly how it would’ve happened (dragon wins = practical) but it throws in a world record breaking jump beforehand which it makes it weird and awesome.

How did I come up with him traveling 35 feet? Take a look at the McC jumping video and pause it at the four-second mark. I measured the length of his body (5 feet – since he is slightly bunched up) and went from there. I established (via tape measure against the television) that in those three seconds he covered 15 feet. Then, I played the video and counted how much longer it was until the dragon ate him (4 seconds). Thus, 7 x 5 = 35. It may seem like a very far distance (it is - the world record is 29 Ft. 4 1/4 in.), however, I think it’s about right considering he never slowed down and is killed while moving at maximum speed. What I find to be most impressive is it broke every single long jump record with ease and less running space. Take a look at this [long jumping clip for reference. Notice that they aren't carrying axes] (https://youtu.be/T0WfsAwvTSU). 

While watching the McC clip I was certain he was always moving closer to the ground (which would happen 100% of the time). However, when the dragon eats him it simply flies over the tower where McC jumped. If McC was falling towards the earth the dragon would’ve smashed into the tower. Thus, further proof of the miraculous 35-foot jump/float. [If you'd like to see them here are some diagrams of what would've happened] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2017/08/02/mff-special-analyzing-matthew-mcconaugheys-record-breaking-jump-in-reign-of-fire/)

I 100% believe that McC’s character didn’t think he was going to die. I think he thought he would murder the dragon with a mighty swing of his axe and land on his feet. However, much like Samuel L. Jackson and The Rock in *The Other Guys* he horribly misjudged his actions and didn’t think about what would happen. That is why I love this moment because it defies everything that cinema has taught us. I never suspected that he would literally float for 35 feet in the air for seven seconds whilst holding an axe and then die. The scene is memorable because it is believable and insane in the span of 10 seconds.

9,"After lots of research, guesswork and analyzing fictional tunnels I've come to the conclusion that Fifield the geologist only had to make two lefts and a right to escape the pyramid structure in Prometheus Do you ever wonder how Fifield the geologist got lost in *Prometheus*? I sure have, so I decided to come up with some answers that will shed light on the plot hole. The point of this post isn’t to dogpile on a film that I enjoy. The end goal is to figure out how two people got lost when they probably shouldn’t of.  Like all my other posts about *Deep Blue Sea, Halloween H20: 20 Years Later* and *The Cabin in the Woods* I’ve done a ton of work and research to make an educated guess that I’m happy with.


If you aren’t familiar with Prometheus it tells the story of space explorers dying violently while Guy Pearce wears old man makeup. I have very fond memories of my first viewing. My wife and I went to a local restaurant for our customary after movie drinks and we ended up having a very nice bartender who went heavy with the free drinks. We proceeded to go way in-depth in an effort to figure out the timeline and the Architects plan. I can’t remember the last time I’ve spent so much time breaking down a film’s plot.


Here is how it all goes down. The doomed crew land on an alien planet in search of life and find some ominous looking structures. The ship lands about 2,000 feet from the structure and they ride to the death trap in some sweet ATVs, then walk into the circular dome and [send out some orbs to map the area] (https://vimeo.com/127434715)

Once inside the building (30:44), they take a left (32:00), then take a right and walk until they come to a watery area that features obvious terraforming (32:28). They take a look, remove their helmets, turn back and walk down the very long tunnel that could possibly lead them to the other end. If the [structure is 2,300 feet long] (http://www.wisdom-square.com/movie-prometheus-analysis-dangers-of-time-space-travel.html) and the tomb is in the middle that means the crew has a maximum of 1,150 feet to walk before they arrive in the middle. This makes sense because the tunnel they are walking in looks a little longer than a 100-yard football field. Eventually, David (Michael Fassbender) triggers some holographic Architects (alien dudes) who come running through the tunnel and take a right towards the tomb area. The crew follows (36:02) and they come across a decapitated architect laying next to a massive door.

This is when Fifield gets pissed, says something about rocks and storms away from the group with dopey Millburn in tow. The irony is they end up back in the same area and meet their demise via a rapidly growing snake thing.  All they had to do was take a left, walk down a long tunnel, take another left and eventually take one more very noticeable right. There was basically zero reason for them to get lost so I’m going to come up with a possible route that he could’ve taken to get himself killed. 

Fifield wasn’t thinking straight and decided to take a left turn too early despite Millburn meekly suggesting they should go a little further. They get to the end of the hallway and take a left. They end up walking up the parallel hallway and this is why they don’t hear the other crew running to their ATVs. Here is how the conversation goes.

**Millburn**: Are you sure we’re going the right way?

**Fifield:** Yes

**Millburn:** Shouldn’t we just follow the long tunnel that lead us to the dead alien guy?

**Fifield:** Nope

**Millburn:** Really?

**Fifield:** Yes! Trust me! I know exactly where I’m going.

It takes a minute for the crew to get back to the ship and realize the two are missing. Fifield and Millburn are called on their comms and told to stay inside because a massive storm is coming (convenient). They’re informed of movement underground via their captain and wisely decide to go the other way. The problem is they walk around in circles and end up back at the tomb. This is where they meet their end.

The reason the Fifield died is because he is a stubborn fellow who wouldn’t listen to his buddy (in a fake conversation). All they had to do was take two lefts and a right and they were guaranteed to live a little bit longer and not become a punch line.

9,"Movies that feature a bearded/mustachioed Kurt Russell have a higher combined RT/IMDb average than movies that feature Russell as a superhero dad, stuntman, soldier or lover of sleeveless t-shirts  In my quest to put together the most random compilation of weird data-centric posts I had to include Russell’s films. I recently took a deep dive into his filmography and collected all the critical/audience scores for all of his films since 1980. I wanted to know which Russell films audiences (IMDb) and critics (RT) love most. Do they like mustachioed/bearded Russell? Do they like sleeveless shirt Russell? Are they fans of Elvis Russell? **Of course, there is zero correlation or causation in regards to whether or not a certain type of Russell will make a film better.** This post simply points out random facts and gives you something to talk about at the water cooler.

Before we move along with the post here are my top five Russell flicks. You need to watch them

1. *Big Trouble in Little China* – [Jack Burton is the best action hero ever] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/07/13/everybody-relax-im-here-an-appreciation-of-jack-burton-and-big-trouble-in-little-china/)
2. *The Thing* – Perfect horror film
3. *Tombstone* – Great mustache
4. *Escape From New York* – Snake is the best
5. *Miracle* – Dude can act.


I decided to go with his films dating back from 1980 because the majority of his pre-1980 movies don’t have Rotten Tomatoes scores. My random data needs actual data to be so random! Take a look at his [IMDb page] (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000621/) to see which films are included on the list.

Take a look at Russell’s top 10 films according to critic/audience combined averages.

*Swing Shift/Tombstone* – 75.5

*The Hateful Eight* – 76

*Furious 7*  – 76

*Miracle* – 77.5

*Big Trouble in Little China* – 77.5

*Deepwater Horizon* – 78

*Escape From New York* – 78.5

*Bone Tomahawk* – 80.5

*Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 2* – 81

 *The Thing* – 82

There are some great films on the list and they led me to a startling conclusion (somewhat hyperbole). Movies that feature a bearded/mustachioed Russell have the highest combined average score (78.8). *The Thing, Bone Tomahawk. Deepwater Horizon, The Hateful Eight,* *Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2* and *Tombstone* all feature Russell crushing some sweet facial hair.

Here is a breakdown of the various sub-genres of Russell films.

**Beard/Mustache Russell – 78.8%** (Deepwater Horizon, The Thing, The Hateful Eight, Bone Tomahawk, Tombstone, Guardians 2)

**Superhero Dad Russell – 74.25%** (Guardians 2, Sky High)

**Period Piece Russell – 70.5%** (Bone Tomahawk, Winter People, The Swing Shift, Tombstone, Miracle, The Hateful Eight)

**Science Fiction/Fantasy Russell – 70.25%** (The Thing, Guardians 2, Soldier, Escape From L.A./New York, Big Trouble in Little China, Stargate, Sky High)

**Car Russell – 70%** (Used Cars, Fast 7 & 8, Deathproof)

**Coach Russell – 64.5%** (Miracle, Touchback)

**Stuntman Russell –  60.75%** (Deathproof, The Art of the Steal)

**Law Enforcement/Soldier/Fire Fighter Russell**  – 60.7% (Backdraft, Bone Tomahawk, Soldier, Dark Blue, Tango & Cash,  Stargate, Tombstone, Hateful Eight)

**Sleeveless T-shirt Russell- 59.9%**  (Captain Ron, Tango & Cash, Escape From New York/L.A., Overboard, Big Trouble in Little China)

**Eye-Patch Russell - 58.3** (Escape From NY/L.A., Captain Ron)

**Elvis Russell- 58.25%**  (3,000 Miles to Graceland, Forrest Gump)

**Water Russell – 54.3%** –   (Captain Ron, Deepwater Horizon, Poseidon)

I can’t say with 100% certainty that the facial hair didn’t make a difference. I can say that it helps working with Quentin Tarantino, Peter Berg, James Gunn and John Carpenter.  I  thought that his sleeveless shirt movies (*Captain Ron, Tango & Cash, Escape From New York/L.A., Overboard, Big Trouble in Little China*) would have the highest average but they were hindered by the really bad scores of *Captain Ron* and *Tango & Cash*. I am happy that Superhero Dad Russell took second place. If you haven’t watched *Sky High* and want to see Bruce Campbell and Kurt Russell in a film together do it now.

The bottom line is that Kurt Russell is the best. The guy has been making great films for a long time and I love that between The *Fate of the Furious* and *Guardians Vol. 2* he has starred in two of the biggest 2017 films. If you want to start somewhere I totally recommend checking out *The Thing* because it is perfection.

9,"After analyzing the underground corridors and Merman speed in The Cabin in the Woods I think the Merman would need at least 15 minutes to make its murderous journey from the elevator to the control center Do you ever wonder how long it took the Merman to travel from the elevators to the control room in *The Cabin in the Woods*? I sure have. After doing an excessive amount of analysis (E.G. pausing to count the number of steps on a staircase) I have an answer that is based on guess work and actual data. Much like my other posts that center around Michael Myers using his blinker, sharks scheming underwater and Leatherface running. I’ve done as much homework as possible to make an educated guess.

If you haven’t watched *The Cabin in the Woods* it centers around a bunch of good looking people being killed to satiate the ancient god’s thirst for sacrifices. Helping the Gods are a bunch of office drones who make sure the killing goes off without a hitch. One of the main controllers Hadley (Bradley Whitford) is fascinated by the murderous Merman who never seems to get picked by the unwitting victims. In true horror comedy fashion, irony strikes when he is killed by the Merman when everything goes wrong.

The problem is the slow moving creature had to crawl its way through long corridors and down some stairs to find his target. [Watch this behind the scenes clip to see how slow it moves] (https://youtu.be/nBrf5RRZEBs)

After watching and rewatching various clips from the movie I’ve patched together a likely path the Merman had to take. First, let me start off by telling you that the Merman moves at a very slow pace of 41.25 feet every 60 seconds. Basically, it reaches out one of its arms and pulls itself forward very slowly. The most curious thing about the Merman is that there is no blood on its body when it finally attacks Hadley. Thus, it must’ve stayed away from the chaos and not murdered anyone because he is really clean. [Here is the initial attack] (https://youtu.be/a0dkF8CZxks)

I believe the Merman was one of the first creatures to be delivered by the elevators because it didn’t have to crawl through the insane amounts of blood. It exited the elevator and made its way through roughly 264 feet of corridors on the 100 level. I came up with 264 feet when I tracked the time it took for the armed guards to reach the elevators. I clocked them doing a 15-minute mile (5280 / 15 = 352 feet a minute) and I did the math from there. They cautiously walked through the corridors for roughly 45 seconds (264 feet) and I believe their main security station was close to the staircase that the Merman had to go down. [Take a look at the video to get a feel for the building] (https://youtu.be/tdMQZ0g9ykE)

Once at the stairs, the Merman had to go down approximately 40 feet of steps (we need this deleted scene). Why did he have to go downstairs? In the beginning of the film, Hadley and Sitterson are walking on the 100 level to get some coffee. You can clearly see they have to go down a staircase to get to their golf cart. Also, during the attack, you will notice the creatures going down stairs to attack their prey as well. I believe the 100 level was where the elevators exited the monsters because during the unicorn attack you see a sign for room 100. I don’t think the unicorn had a chance to go down some stairs so 100 level it is!

After they make the trek downstairs the duo get into a golf cart and go to the control office. I’m wagering the trip had to be at least 300 feet to warrant taking a golf cart. Since these two guys seem bored with their job and caught in a routine I think they take the cart everywhere out of boredom. Throw in an added 20 feet to get into the large control center and the total jumps up to 320 feet.

The Merman had to travel 624 feet (264 + 40 + 300 + 20) in order to kill Hadley and create a whole lot of irony. Since Mr. Merman could only move 41.25 feet every minute the trip took a total of at least 15.127 minutes (+/- 30 seconds.). I initially thought the scene played out in real time but after destroying my soul with multiple brutal viewings I started really watching the video screens that showed the villains corralling various workers and killing them in Saw-esque fashion.

I am 93.456% certain that 15 minutes was the minimum amount of time needed to make the deadly trip. The Merman didn’t waste time killing anybody else and his 15-minute crawl left plenty of time for professional/mythical killers to horribly kill people via fire, chains, and gross surgery.

9,"Live action movies that feature characters being swallowed whole and surviving with nary a scratch have an average budget of $209,000,000. There is a moment in *Waterworld* that has stuck with me for years. It involves [Kevin Costner killing a massive sea beast] (https://youtu.be/lZQF83kf-a4) with ease and then feeding it to people for dinner. I’ve never understood how a person can be swallowed whole by a many teethed beast and survive. The odds are basically insurmountable but it just keeps happening to cinematic characters.

The following posts breaks down the numbers of the live-action films that feature characters being swallowed whole whilst engaging in battle and surviving with nary a scratch. 

**Sidenote:** There are some films that features characters surviving a terrible ordeal. However, movies like *Pinocchio, Where the Wild Things Are, Anaconda* or *The Empire Strikes Back* don’t fit entirely into the criteria that I have set up. For instance, [poor Jon Voight in Anaconda] (https://youtu.be/JWqaTJbxbW0) comes out on the bad side of things after being swallowed whole.

**1.The Average Budget is $209,000,000**

Movies that feature people being eaten whole and getting out of it with nary a scratch are really expensive. Five of the movies (*Waterworld, Pacific Rim, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* and *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest*) cost over $200 million and the lowest budget was *Land of the Lost’s* $116 million. I’m guessing when you are featuring massive beasts you need a massive CGI budget and all of these films (sans *Waterworld*) have loads of CGI. Take a look at this scene from *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest* and you will see what I mean.


**2. The Average Inflated Domestic Box Office is $294,000,000**

People love movies that feature people being swallowed whole by creatures. Compared to all my other data involving movies featuring Foghat, jet ski action scenes, Corona and pencils used as weapons the total is massive. I understand the majority of these films are summer blockbusters but I’m still really impressed with the haul. I’d forgotten how HUGE the *Pirates of the Caribbean* and *Transformers* franchises are. They both made over $450 million domestically which would be top five in any year. Too bad *Land of the Lost* and its $57 million haul kept the total from $300 million. I do love the [T-Rex vaulting scene though] (https://youtu.be/OxCVucvlF1o).


**3. Rotten Tomatoes Critics Almost Consider Them Fresh and Audiences Sorta Love Them**

The 55% RT average is actually pretty good considering this list features Transformers, Kevin Costner’s ego and broad jokes. I was pleasantly surprised to see the high ratings for *Men in Black (92%), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (81%)* and *Pacific Rim (71%)*. I love these three films and appreciate that some of my [favorite characters survived being swallowed whole] (https://youtu.be/G9puHtVcU5o). 

I wasn’t surprised audience scores were above average. The 6.7 score is legit and proves audiences love a lot of these films despite deserved bad ratings from critics. Only two of the movies (*Men in Black, Pacific Rim*) had higher RT scores than IMDb scores and that is natural considering IMDb scores never reach Men in Black’s 92% RT score and critics more often than not appreciate Guillermo del Toro (7.1 > 70%) more than the mainstream audiences.

There you have it! Movies that feature people surviving being swallowed are very expensive to make and are often profitable!

9,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake has taught me that Leatherface can cover 72 feet in five seconds and potentially wash 60-bed sheets in a short period of time. I fell asleep while watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003. It is a stock remake that looks glossy, plays ugly and I haven’t really given it a second thought. The movie may be forgettable but there is a moment that has stuck with me for years. [Watch the clip] (https://youtu.be/cAM7skQKVk8) and pay attention to what happens during the 1:16 – 1:37 range.

Here is the breakdown of the 20-second foot chase.

**1:16 – 1:30** – Leatherface chases Andy through a never-ending maze of bed sheets.

**1:31** – Leatherface veers off and makes a uber sprint

**1:37** – Andy has no leg

**1:38** – I’m wondering how that could’ve happened.

For years I’ve wondered how a lumbering killer managed to run ahead of a sprinting kid named Andy in the span of seconds. Lately, I’ve become emboldened with my dumb horror statistics and I decided to finally figure out Leatherface’s mad sprint. Here is what happens (according to some math and guesswork). Let’s assume Andy covered 194 feet in 20 seconds according to the standard time/distance of a 9-minute mile.

9-minute mile = 586 feet per minute.

586 / 60 = 9.7 feet per second

194 feet covered in 20 seconds.

He was slowed down a bit by the sheets but there were moments of outright sprinting which lead me to the 9-minute mile approximation. During the first 12 seconds, Leatherface is about 10 feet behind him. However, in a five-second span the bulky murderer exploded around Andy and managed to chop off his leg. I don’t think Leatherface is a supernatural fellow so I went ahead and did the math to see how he could possibly get around Andy.

Before I get to the numbers I want to discuss the insane amount of sheets hanging up on the property. This involves some guesswork but there are about 20 rows of sheets hanging up outside. It looks like there are three sheets on each row which mean the deadly family somehow washed and hung up 60 sheets in a logical and practical manner. Why are they using so many sheets? Here are some questions.

1. The average washer fits several sheets. Did Leatherface do 20 loads?

2. Hand washing each sheet individually would take at least 20 minutes. Did they take 18 hours to hand wash?

3. Why are the dry sheets still out?

4. Do they leave the sheets out to snag people in?

Back to the chase! After watching the video way too many times it looks like Andy is running in a pretty straight line. There isn’t much zigzagging or tripping which allows Leatherface to catch up. So, how in the heck did Leatherface manage to get in front of Andy in five seconds?

In the span of Andy running 48.5 feet (1:31 – 1:36) Leatherface ran around Andy, managed to plant his feet and swing a chainsaw. This means he had to cover at least 72 feet in five seconds to get around the guy to chop off his leg. Thus, Leatherface sprinted to a speed of a 6.1 minute mile during his five-second burst. I find it really impressive that a man who is 6’5 and weighs 265 (actual height/weight of actor) can run that fast around sheets while holding a chainsaw.

There you have it! The mystery is somewhat solved. Now I need to figure out those sheets.

[I was wrong] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/68vodi/after_averaging_the_rotten_tomatoes_scores_of_tv/). I'm not afraid to admit it. In fact, I think it was a nice learning experience.

[The 29% overall average for movies features a jet ski action scene] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/68vodi/after_averaging_the_rotten_tomatoes_scores_of_tv/) is really bad and if you've read my other dumb data posts you will know that - Jet Skis + Good = won't happen. 

I really thought that The Rock could charm his way through an uneven but funny mixture of comedy, good looking people and more good looking people. However, it didn't happen and I look silly. I know there are other causes for the 21% score but we all know jet skis played a 37% part in the film getting 21% on RT (zero data to back this up). 

I will learn from this experience and come back stronger. My data won't be any more reliable but I will certainly be less rash and wild with my added percentages.

9,"After researching various maps, 1971 Buick Skylark gas mileage, and fictional cities I've come to the conclusion that Michael Myers refueled his car at least nine times, used the blinker 57 times and averaged 63.2 MPH on his massive road trip in Halloween H20: 20 Years Later The only thing that can stop an unstoppable force is a red traffic light. For over 40 years Michael Myers and his driving skills have been scrutinized and mocked. How did a “shape” who lived in a mental institution learn how to operate a vehicle? Michael’s driving in the first film has never bothered me because the driving was erratic and primal. The driving that bothers me is in Halloween H20: 20 Year Later because he made a 1,994 mile trip successfully with zero citations or tickets. In the film Michael drives from Langdon Illinois to Hillcrest Academy in Northern California in a daring feat that raises a lot of questions.

1. Does he wear the mask when driving or siphoning gas?
2. Did he listen to the radio?
3. How does he deal with merging onto highways? Is he cool about it?
4. Does he dislike people who drive slow in the fast lane?
5. Does he not know how to fix a flat fire?

I remember loving the film as an impressionable 15-year old punk. The movie had thrills, Dawsons Creek-esque dialogue and Jamie Lee Curtis going on the offensive. However, I’ve never liked that a mysterious shape could drive cross-country. Michael Myers works best as a mysterious murderer who doesn’t have parent issues and could care less about following traffic rules. He had to navigate a lot of terrain on his journey which means he had to follow the rules and not murder people who cut him off.  The trip took him an estimated 43.5 hours. Here is the timeline (with some guesswork and actual times from the movie):

**October 29 – 5:30PM** – Leaves Langdon in a stolen 1971 Buick Skylark.  A  handy grandfather clock states that it is 5:30PM.

**October 31 – 9:00AM** – Michael steals a 1956 International Harvester Travelall  at a rest stop off Highway 139 in Northern California.

**October 31 – 10:00AM**– Arrives in the fictional town and cruises around a bit before he settles on main street at 11:00AM

**October 31 – 1:00PM** – Follows Laurie from the downtown area and finds out where the school is.

**Total time:** 43.5 hours

Breakdown of hours

32 (driving Highway/Susanville) + 5.5 (refueling) + 2 (waiting on main street) + 1.5 (waiting at rest stop) + 1 (eating? He eats rats in Resurrection…dude needs snacks) + 1.5 (nap?) = 43.5

Michael left Langdon on October 29th at 5:30PM in a 1971 Buick Skylark and drove all the way to California. He was forced to stop close to his destination when an unfortunate flat tire forced him to stop at a rest stop along Highway 139. During the trip he had to make at least nine pit stops to refuel because the 71 Skylark only averaged 15 miles per gallon and the 15.2 gallon gas tank only got him a maximum of 228 miles. I think it might be easier for him to refuel at night but according to the math he had to make five daytime gas stops. That had to get kinda complicated because he had no money, doesn’t talk and didn’t steal any steal cars. 

To make it in 29 hours like the Google map states he would have to drive 68 MPH. I don’t buy it so I slowed him down to 63.2 MPH. 63.2 X 32 hours on the road = 2.022.4. He covered 1,994 miles on the various highways and 28.4 on Highway 139 and various other roads after he found the school.

Since Langdon and Hillcrest are fictional, I found cities that are relatively close to the locations. Langdon was in Livingston County, Illinois so I found a town that had a similar population. Then, I looked along Highway 139 in Northern California and picked Susanville due to its proximity to the highway and Yosemite State Park (because there is a convenient school trip there). The locations aren’t exact but I was working with fictional towns so I to make an educated guess.

After coming up with the distance and car information I started thinking about Myers using his blinker while making turns or switching lanes. There is nothing less frightening than thinking about him casually flipping on the blinker to make a left turn. After looking at the directions Michael had to use his blinker AT LEAST 17 times (per google maps) if he always stayed in the slow lane. If you add the nine pit stops to exit the highway and his cruising around the small town that is somewhere around 40. Thus, Michael Myers the unstoppable killing force had to use his blinker 57 times. Immortal demons with pitch black eyes should never be bothered with speed limits, rear view mirrors and potential zipper merges.

There you have it! Michael Myers successfully completed a long drive and never got pulled over.

A lone trucker in *The Fast and the Furious* beat them with ease [(Youtube clip here)] (https://youtu.be/K6HSnr2ELb4) and did what Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, Luke Evans, Cole Hauser and John Ortiz couldn't do. 

The trucker just drove in a straight line, didn't lose his nerve and was able to reload a shotgun whilst driving a massive truck. He wasn't about to lose precious cargo to some speed racers and he made them pay. I respect that. 

I wonder if Dom, Brian, Letty and Mia decided to not tell anybody about it. Also, I wonder if the trucker has ever seen the crew on the news and been like ""I took them out with ease!""

9,"After a fair amount of research, calculations and guesswork I've figured out that Stellan Skarsgard traveled 1.12 miles between getting his arm bit off and being used as a battering ram in Deep Blue Sea I love Deep Blue Sea. It is a brilliantly dumb film that never gets old and always gets better. I was working in a movie theater when it was released in 1999 and I loved sitting in the theater listening to the audience go crazy. In all my years working at a theater no film came close to getting the reaction that Deep Blue Sea did. I’ve been writing, podcasting and talking about it for years and I haven’t been able to shake one scene in particular. Stellan Skarsgard’s (AKA Jim) incredibly long death scene is insane because it is a pure nightmare creation that is equal parts terrifying, inventive and funny. The official youtube clips are [here] (https://youtu.be/m2aC-nkV1Zg) and [here] (https://youtu.be/rvqm61CcOLo) and if [you like this dumb data you can share the post] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2017/05/09/diving-into-the-deep-data-of-deep-blue-sea/).

This is how it goes down. A genetically modified super shark bites Stellan Skarsgard’s arm off while the shark is being tested on. Stellan is taken up a freight elevator to a rescue helicopter. During the rescue, Stellan is strapped to a gurney and given an oxygen mask. As he is being lifted to the helicopter, a shark grabs hold of the gurney and Stellan goes on a long journey underwater that ends with him being used as a battering ram. It is a gnarly death that has somehow been overshadowed by the [glorious demise of Sam Jackson] (https://youtu.be/BS8I9H07wKw).

The following breaks down the amount of traveling poor Stellan had to endure.

**Sidenote: I’ve tried my best to recreate a fictitious moment in an insane film about genetically engineered sharks herding humans to their death. The numbers are researched but I just didn’t have enough data to be 100% correct. There is some guesswork at play, but I believe they paint a believable picture of what happened to Stellan Skarsgard.**


Let’s start off with the journey to the freight elevator. I’m guessing the trip was about 40 feet after he got his arm ripped off.

Once they got on the elevator the trip took 30 seconds. According to Stanley Elevators, a stock freight elevator moves at an average speed of 200 feet per minute. The elevator covered 100 feet in its 30-second journey. Next, Stellan had to be lifted onto a helicopter. The problem is he didn’t make it very far, therefore I’m guessing he covered approximately 50 feet. This is where things get interesting because the poor guy is pulled underwater with an oxygen tank strapped to his mouth.

I’m not a genetically engineered shark with a lust for blood and thus, I cannot track the exact movements underwater. I’d assume the shark was all business and put its energy into building towards battering ram speed. By using my shark brain [(via a hat that looks like a shark fin)] (https://youtu.be/WkKb9OvXXvk) I’m guessing the shark circled the interior of the Aquatica figuring how to best hit the massive glass wall.

During a nice moment of expositional dialogue (thank you random scientist!) we learned there are a half mile of catwalks on the surface of the structure. After examining the structure I broke down the numbers and figured out the outside fenced dimensions to be 590′ x 295′ (give or take 15 feet or so). You’d think the perimeter would be a half-mile around but there several catwalks that travel through the perimeter, wrap around the structure in the middle and go outside the perimeter. The math looks like this.

Perimeter (1770′) + 2 catwalks (295′) + several additional catwalks (575′) = 2,640 feet.

The shark swam through the middle then circled the Aquatica and its prey until it got comfortable enough to send Skarsgard into oblivion. The total estimated distance is 1.09 miles and total time spent traveling untethered from the helicopter is 110 seconds. The shark swam at an average of 35.6 MPH which lead me to believe the shark started slow then built up to a much faster speed to accrue the 35.6 MPH average. The fastest shark on the planet can swim top speeds of 40 – 55 MPH, therefore I’m guessing the shark swam slower laps until it got everything just right and exploded to 60 MPH (this shark is really really ridiculously fast).

I love that this scene happened. It is wildly inventive and devious in its quest to kill somebody. My calculations may be slightly off but I believe the total estimated distance covered by Skargard is 5,959 feet or 1.12 miles. That is impressive!

In case you are still skeptical, I’ve come up with two other underwater options that are much less cool and make the shark look silly.

**1.** The shark accidentally drops the gurney and Stellan falls to the bottom of the Aquatica. The shark swims down to the bottom and picks up the gurney (which takes a while because it is cumbersome). Then, the sharks swims to the far side of the fencing (hoping the other sharks didn’t see) and turns around towards the large glass window.


**2.** The shark thinks it is going towards the large glass but realizes it is going the wrong way and has to course correct. Then it swims around like it knew what it was doing (so it doesn’t look dumb) and ends up covering over a mile in an effort to not look silly.
I’m hoping this data answers some questions you never knew you had but always felt like you should know. I realize this post won’t change the world but hopefully, it put a smile on your face and solidified your love of Deep Blue Sea!

9,"After averaging the Rotten Tomatoes scores of TV adaptations, Seth Gordon's movies and films that feature The Rock, Zac Efron and jet ski action scenes I'm predicting Baywatch will have a 62% average on RT. **Quick Note: There is zero causation, correlation, big calculations or FiveThirtyEight wizardry here. Just dumb data meant to be fun.**

I love using somewhat relevant data to predict a films Rotten Tomatoes score. The data isn’t exact and only somewhat reliable, but I enjoy seeing if old trends and actors/directors averages can somewhat predict the success of a film. I don’t have flowcharts, abacuses or an around the clock crew of rogue movie predictors working furiously in a dimly lit office. I have a will to scour through Rotten Tomatoes, Google and Youtube in an effort to have a solid data that predicts unimportant things.


I predicted [XXX: The Return of Xander Cage would have a 36% RT Score] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5oty00/according_to_nonsensical_evidence_vin_diesels/) and was pleasantly surprised when it received 43%. I actually wanted to add five more points to the finished product but I went against my Vin-O-Meter and ended up short. This time I’m trying to predict the RT score of Baywatch.

1. I brought back my Jet Action Scene data because Baywatch features JS action. Jet ski action scenes are the worst and they average 29% on Rotten Tomatoes. 

2. I collected the RT scores of recent comedic television adaptations. Aside from 21 & 22 Jump Street (85, 84), television adaptations haven’t done well with the critics. The overall average is 45.6% and only 21 & 22 Jump Street, Charlie’s Angels, Starsky & Hutch and The Man From U.N.C.L.E have fresh averages. Bewitched, Get Smart, Land of the Lost, Dukes of Hazard and The A-Team (and more) were not loved by the RT critics.


3. Between The Fast & the Furious, G.I. Joe, Be Cool, Journey 2, Scorpion King, Get Smart, Walking Tall, Race to WitchMountain and Hercules, The Rock loves stepping into a preexisting material. Thus, I averaged out the scores and came up with 50.3% average


4. Zac Efron’s recent comedic films have been up and down on RT. Neighbors 1 & 2 are fresh (73%, 62%) whereas Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (35), That Awkward Moment (23) and Bad Grandpa (11) are pretty rotten. The uneven comedies lead to a 40.8% average. It’s not good, but it could be a lot worse.


5. Seth Gordon exploded onto the scene with the brilliant documentary The King of Kong (97%). The documentary about Donkey Kong catapulted him into directing big budget comedies Four Christmases (25%), Horrible Bosses (68%), Identity Thief (19%) and now Baywatch. His four films have an average of 52.25%. You need to watch The King of Kong now!


The average of these five categories is 42.32%. Normally I’d be happy to bestow that average on a film that features jet ski action scenes. However, the movie looks really funny and it features the beloved Dwayne Johnson. So, I’m going to add another 20 points to the average and boost it into fresh territory with a 62.32% average. I’m putting my reputation on the line with this score but I’m sticking to it.

**Rotten Tomatoes average for Baywatch – 42%**

**My Prediction for Baywatch - 62%**

9,"Movies that feature a villainous John Travolta smoking in a villainous manner have an averaged RT/IMDb score of 64.8% and average an inflated domestic box office of $120 million. John Travolta had a beautiful run playing [villainous men who maniacally smoked tobacco products] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2015/04/14/the-bad-guy-and-the-cigarette-analyzing-the-villainous-smoking-choices-of-john-travolta/). Beginning in 1994 with Pulp Fiction and going all the way to 2004’s The Punisher no man has smoked so villainously. What I love most about his smoking is how the various smoking styles differed.

*Pulp Fiction* – Stylish but not over the top

*Broken Arrow* – Full on addiction

*Face/Off*– Kinda cool

*Swordfish* – Looks like he is always about to facepalm himself

*The Punisher* – Dude smoked a pipe……


Here is the breakdown of the box office and critical data.

**Sidenote: This data features zero correlation, causation or major calculations. It is dumb data intended to put a smile on your face.**

**1. The Average Rotten Tomatoes critic score is 59.2%**

I love that Face/Off currently has a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes because it is wildly insane. Travolta went full overacting villain and the result was glorious, strange and awesome. It is only two points below the much beloved Pulp Fiction which has a 94% rating. If it wasn’t for The Punisher 29% and Swordfish 26% Travolta would be the king of all smoking villains (I think).

I’m kinda bummed that the Thomas Jane Punisher movie didn’t do well. What I love is how Travolta was in the cigar land of Tampa and chose to smoke a damn pipe. Tampa finally gets put on the map and the dude doesn’t go with the obvious (maybe that is brilliant).

**2. The Average IMDb score is 7.04**

7.04 is a very good average for Travolta. Pulp Fiction has a crazy 8.9 score but the others carry their weight and prove that people love movies that feature Travolta chain smoking. Broken Arrow and Face/Off were legit events and they were carried in part by Travolta’s smoke inhalation. My theory is that he looked awesome in Pulp Fiction so he just kept doing it until he didn’t (Punisher). 

**3. The Average inflated domestic box office is $120,357,903**

$120 million is nothing to blow smoke at. During his smoking run Travolta put people in the seats and undoubtedly taught people how to smoke cigarettes incorrectly. I remember being 100% stoked to watch Face/Off, Broken Arrow and Swordfish. Travolta was a cool villain who wasn’t afraid to rock funky haircuts and do weird face waterfalls all over people’s faces and that made $$$$.

Nowadays R-rated action fests have a tough time breaking the $100 million mark. John Wick 2 is unbelievably awesome and it only made $91 million (which is really good). Both Face/Off and Broken Arrow made over $100 million domestically and Swordfish came close with $96 million. That doesn’t really happen anymore when it comes to original R-rated properties.

**Conclusion: Travolta should’ve smoked cigarettes in Battlefield Earth**

Battlefield Earth is pure unbridled garbage. However, if Travolta would’ve been smoking cigarettes his character would’ve looked cooler (I have no proof of this). Also, the smoking might’ve helped him in The Taking of Pelham 123, Mad City and The Killing Season. My theory is that without the prop he couldn’t channel a properly evil character and he floundered in massive prosthetics and overly-manicured facial hair.

9,"The Fast and the Furious movies that feature Corona being consumed average $250 million domestically and have a 63% combined IMDb/RT score. The Fast movies that don't feature Corona average $163 million domestically and have a 57% RT/IMDb average. **You can have any brew you want, as long as it's a Corona**

With these beautiful words The Fast and the Furious announced its glorious partnership with Corona. Corona saw its zenith in The Fast & The Furious, but it got a massive push in Furious 7 when Dom famously turned down delicious Belgian beer in favor of a bucket of Corona. Corona and the Fast world have become synonymous with each other and have built a beautiful world in which nobody gets drunk or gains weight due to excessive drinking. However,  after rewatching all the films I've come to realize Corona doesn't play that big of a role in the Fast world. In my mind, the entire team are always incorrectly chugging bottled beer while cruising around the earth engaging in shenanigans. I am 100% serious when I say I was surprised when I compiled the numbers of Corona sightings. 

**Here are the numbers.**

1. The Fast and the Furious - 12 bottles opened and consumed (but never finished) - several empty bottles
2. 2 Fast 2 Furious - 0
3. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift - 0
4. Fast and Furious - 5-6 **
5. Fast Five - 0
6. Fast and Furious 6 - 10 bottles laying around
7. Furious 7 - 4 bottles in bucket


**Here are some facts:**

1. The beer is only consumed when the gang is in California.
2. The only time anybody other than Dom drinks Corona is when they are with Dom.*
3. No Corona is ever finished
4. Some people don't know how to drink beer.

The following post breaks down the data on the Fast and Furious franchise and analyzes whether or not Corona consumption affects box office and audience/critical reaction. Also,  I'm going to attempt to predict how many Coronas will be consumed in The Fate of the Furious.

**Fast & Furious films that feature Corona**

Movies: The Fast & the Furious, Fast & Furious, Fast & Furious 6, Furious 7

Average Inflated Domestic Box Office: $250 million

Average RT/IMDb Combined Average: 63.25%

The box office average was boosted massively by the insane $354 million haul of Furious 7. If I had to guess why the films have done so well is because they all featured Vin in a lead role and kept the ""core"" team together. After Fast & Furious the series became a money printing press and learned how to really embrace the smart stupidity of it all. I love that a Point Break ripoff has grown into a certified fresh blockbuster that just won't quit.


**Fast & Furious films that don't feature Corona**

Movies: 2 Fast 2 Furious, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Fast Five

Average Inflated Domestic Box Office: $163 million

Average RT/IMDb Combined Average: 57%


I feel really bad for these three films because they are my favorite. My top three are 2 Fast 2 Furious, Fast Five and Tokyo Drift. I think they all have their own personalities and still embraced family, cars and action. 2 Fast and Tokyo suffered from a lack of Diesel but they also introduced the world to my favorite characters Roman Pierce (Tyrese), Tej (Ludacris) and Han Seoul-Oh (Sung Kang). It bums me out that they are losing out to the likes of Fast & Furious and Fast & Furious 6.

**The Fate of the Furious Predictions**

Corona has to make an appearance in The Fate of the Furious. The product placement helps sales and even though it isn't in LA I'm betting that 2 bottles are opened and zero are finished.

9,"After learning that there were more movies that featured jet ski action scenes I had to adjust my data from earlier in the year. The RT average is now a fresh 61.7% for movies that feature jet ski action scenes. Earlier this year [I unleashed an incorrect post on Reddit] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5ckqc0/movies_that_feature_jet_ski_action_scenes_have_an/) that said ""Movies that feature jet ski action scenes have an average RT rating of 29% and average an inflated domestic box office of $49 million on $82 million budgets.""

The post was popular but some commentors corrected me, and reminded me of the jet ski action scenes in *Gone With the Wind, The Godfather, Annie Hall, Citizen Kane, The Act of Killing, Gravity, Spotlight, Brooklyn, It Follows, High Noon* and *The Wrestler*

The RT critic average jumped up massively with these new films  (61.7) and taught me I needed to do better research. It was a very humbling experience. 

Here are the other jet ski action movies for reference.  *Transporter 2, Transporter: Refueled, Police Academy 3, Waterworld, Hard Rain, Deep Rising, Speed 2, Shark Night, Fool's Gold, Double Dragon, Piranha 3D, The Pacifier/You Don't Mess with the Zohan*

I am sorry for the wrong data but I'm happy that it has all been sorted. 

Have a great day!

9,"Movies that have ""Best"" in their title have a higher RT/IMDb average (67.87) than movies that have Great (66.36), Perfect (53.56), Good (60.68) and Fantastic (60.43) in their titles. I love random data that has no real world importance for several reasons.

1. I love the look on people’s faces when I tell them movies that feature [jet ski action scenes have a 29% Rotten Tomatoes rating] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5ckqc0/movies_that_feature_jet_ski_action_scenes_have_an/).

2. The data can focus on [pencils] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5vecjc/movies_that_feature_pencils_used_as_weapons_have/), [movie poster explosions] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2013/07/15/movienomics-explosions-and-movie-posters/) and [Foghat] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5zj6u7/movies_that_feature_foghats_slow_ride_have_an/). 

3. The stupid data puts a smile on people’s faces (or really annoys them because they just spent time reading about data with no real world importance).

When looking to further my journey into random film analysis I became inspired during a viewing of *Best in Show.*  I began to wonder which group of movies that boasts big things had the best critic/user average. The following post averages out the Rotten Tomatoes Critic score and IMDB user score of 101 movies that feature Best, Perfect, Good, Fantastic and Great in their titles. For instance, *The Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Great Gatsby, A Perfect Getaway, Good Burger and Best in Show.*

The movies needed at least 20 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and 2,500 ratings on IMDb. If I had to include every single movie it would’ve killed all my free time and the data would’ve been a sham.

Are movies that feature the word Perfect actually perfect? Are Good movies any good? Can something be the best and still take third place? Are dog shows really that competitive?

**5. Perfect**

RT/IMDb Average – 53.56

Best: A Perfect World – 78

Worst: Perfect Holiday – 29.5

There are very few things that are perfect in this world (The Thing, Islay Scotch, JCVD spin kicks) so I wasn’t expecting a grouping of movies to equal out to 100%. However, I was kinda shocked that movies featuring the word Perfect had a 53.56 average. The Perfect Man (30.5), Perfect Stranger (34)  and Perfect Holiday (29.5) hurt the average big time and negated the positive contributions of Pitch Perfect and A Perfect World.

**4. Fantastic**

RT/IMDB Average – 60.43

Best: Fantastic Mr. Fox – 85

Worst: Fantastic Four – 26

Going into this post I assumed Fantastic movies would have the highest average. Movies like The Fantastic Mr. Fox, Captain Fantastic and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them have solid numbers and I figured they would buoy the low scorers. However, I forgot that the 2015 Fantastic Four had a 9% RT average. Since there were so few Fantastic movies the 9% dragged everything down and Fantastic movies took fourth place.

**3. Good**

RT/IMDb Average – 60.68

Best: The Good, The Bad & The Ugly – 96

Worst: Good Luck Chuck – 30.5

Third place isn’t great or bad. Third place is good, which is sorta perfect for Good movies. The 60.68 score narrowly edged out Fantastic movies and placed it in the middle of the pack. If it wasn’t for A Good Day to Die Hard, Good Luck Chuck and No Good Deed, Good movies would’ve overtaken Great movies. If you get a chance make sure to watch The Good, The Bad & The Weird and In Good Company because they are really good.

**2. Great**

RT/IMDb Average – 66.36

Best: Great Expectations – 90

Worst: Barney’s Great Adventure – 25.5

The Great movies did their best to take first place but they were hindered by Barney’s Great Adventure, The Great Raid and The Great Wall (AKA The Ponytail Epic). The 66.36 average was a decent jump over Good and Fantastic films and was almost enough for a first place finish (I blame the ponytail). If you haven’t already I totally recommend you watch  The Great Dictator, World’s Greatest Dad, Great Expectations (1946) and The Great Beauty.

**1. Best**

RT/IMDb Average – 67.87

Best: The Best of Youth – 90

Worst: The Best of Me  – 38

“Best” movies are the best. The Best movies blew away the competition and were propelled by We Are the Best, Best Worst Movie, The Best of Youth, The Best Years of Our Lives, Best in Show and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. The only weak link was the Nicholas Sparks written/produced The Best of Me (9% RT). The Best of Me is actually the worst of all the Sparks films (I’ve watched them all) and I think the 9% is generous."
9,"Movies that feature Foghat's ""Slow Ride"" have an average IMDb user score of 6.35. Movies that feature Foghat's ""I Just Want to Make Love to You"" have an eerily close IMDb user score of 6.28 [Dazed and Confused] (https://youtu.be/ckTlPHpovSY) and [Jim Carrey] (https://youtu.be/zILs4TaYFqs) are responsible for my love of Foghat. To be totally honest, I love the idea of Foghat more than their music. However,  it hasn’t stopped me from doggedly pushing the Foghat agenda on everyone I know. The only thing better than listening to about 30 seconds of a Foghat song is hearing 30 seconds of a Foghat song on a soundtrack. When condensed down from its original eight minute form “Slow Ride” is perfect for movie trailers and the occasional movie scenes that can’t afford Led Zeppelin (AKA Dazed and Confused). 

In an effort to inundate the world with cinematic data of little importance (Think FiveThirtyEight but with dumb movies stats) I decided to follow up my [jet ski action scene] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5ckqc0/movies_that_feature_jet_ski_action_scenes_have_an/) and [pencil as a weapon] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5vecjc/movies_that_feature_pencils_used_as_weapons_have/) pieces with some Foghat data.The following post looks at the IMDb user scores, Rotten Tomatoes critical averages and inflated domestic box office of films that feature the song ‘Slow Ride.”

**1. The Average Rotten Tomatoes critic score is 55%**


If it wasn’t for Wild Hog’s 14% and Jack Frost’s 20% movies that feature “Slow Ride” would be bonafide fresh. However, the two films didn’t take it easy and ended up hurting the score. The good news is “Slow Ride’ movies easily defeated the films that had Foghat’s “I Just Want to Make Love to You” on the soundtrack (49.3%).  The 55% seems pretty perfect because I’d wager that 55% of music lovers have an appreciation of Foghat. 


**2. The Average IMDb score is 6.35**

I have an amazing fact for you! Movies that feature “Slow Ride” average 6.35, whereas movies that feature Foghat’s “I Just Want to Make Love to You” average 6.28%. Mind blown! It seems like films that feature Foghat are all the same in the end! Audiences know what they like and if Foghat is featured 6.3% of them appreciate it.


**3. The Average inflated domestic box office is $69,284,109**

Wild Hogs may have hurt the critical score but it bolstered the box office big time. I was amazed to find out that it made $196 million domestically. That is a lot of money for a milquetoast film about four dudes riding around on motorcycles. Also, I love that Bad Moms cleared $100 million domestically because it proves that original comedies featuring likable people can still make money. The biggest tragedy (that has since been righted) is that Dazed and Confused flopped at the box office with a paltry $13 million. 


**4. The Average inflated budget is $40,000,000**

Did you know that Jack Frost cost $126,000,000 to make? That is crazy! Holy moly! It cost more than Bad Moms, Nighthawks, I Love You Phillip Morris and Wild Hogs combined. The massive budget jacked up the average and makes it seem like movies that feature Foghat have legit budgets. When you get a moment make sure to check out the How Did This Get Made? podcast where they break down Jack Frost because it is a really weird movie.

9,"You Don't Mess With the Zohan is an absolute mind-boggler. It was co-written by Judd Apatow and Robert Smigel, had a $90 million budget, made $200 million worldwide and focuses on an Israeli special agent who moves to NYC to cut hair and have sex with elderly women. I just watched You Don't Mess With the Zohan again. It is as weird as I remembered, and I'm pretty certain only Adam Sandler [during his massively successful run] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/08/11/you-can-do-it-a-look-at-adam-sandlers-epic-20-year-run/) could make it profitable. Here are some thoughts and observations:

9,"Movies that feature pencils used as weapons have an average RT rating of 69.8% and average an inflated domestic box office of $98 million on $47 million budgets. I love random statistics that have zero correlation or causation. Whether they be about [jet ski action scenes] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5ckqc0/movies_that_feature_jet_ski_action_scenes_have_an/), [explosions on movie posters] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2013/07/15/movienomics-explosions-and-movie-posters/) or [Nicholas Sparks movies] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7xj0wq/movies_adapted_from_nicholas_sparks_books_that/) I can’t help compiling data that means little in the long run. The following post examines the data of films that feature pencils used as weapons. I just watched John Wick: Chapter Two and was very impressed with the violence that John was able to inflict on his foes with a pencil. The film influenced me to gather the Rotten Tomatoes critic scores, IMDb user scores and domestic box office/budgets of pencil weapon movies in order to see how they add up. The films Gremlins 2: The New Batch, The Faculty, Evil Dead, The Dark Knight, RocknRolla, From Dusk Till Dawn, Sleeperwalkers, Fright Night and Stoker all feature some fantastic pencil work and the results were surprising.

**Sidenote:** If you are looking for “pen action scene” data you are gonna have to go somewhere else. Sorry Casino, The Bourne Identity and The Running Man. Also, the films Tormented and Pencil do not have enough data to be included in the post. I didn’t include the box office of John Wick: Chapter Two because it just came out.

**The Average Rotten Tomatoes Critic Score is 69.8%**

I was really impressed with the “fresh” 69.8% average. My best guess as to why they are fresh is because they thought outside the box and went creative with the violence. Nobody expects pencils and the results are always surprising and cringe worthy. The fresh average was buoyed by The Dark Knight, (94) John Wick 2 (90), Evil Dead (95) and Fright Night (91). These four films carried Sleepwalkers (15), The Faculty (54), and RocknRolla (59) on their backs and gave cinematic pencil violence a good name.

**The Average Budget is $47 Million**

$47 million is relatively low nowadays for movies that get theatrical releases. The budgets were kept low via the horror films on the list. The Faculty, Evil Dead, Fright Night, Stoker and From Dusk Till Dawn all have budgets below $30 million. The Dark Knight and its $205 million budget are what kept the budgets in the 40s. The biggest surprise was the $92 million (with inflation) budget of Gremlins 2: The New Batch. Key and Peele were right, G2 is a crazy film and [their video is great] (https://youtu.be/x01l_jMhjVM)


**The Average Inflated Domestic Box Office is $98,927,434**

$98,927,434 is nothing to sneeze at. I was very impressed with the tally and it made jet ski action scene movies look bad in comparison ($49 million). The Dark Knight jacked up the average with its $593 million, but Gremlins 2, The Faculty, Fright Night and Sleepwalkers all collected over $50 million at the box office (with inflation) and helped out as well. The only film that super tanked was the very good Stoker ($1.7 million).

**The Average IMDb User Score is 7.14**

The 7.14 average proves that IMDb users like pencil violence more than critics (I can’t back this up). I was surprised to see the 7.14 average because it is really quite high. The Dark Knight (9) and John Wick 2 (8.5) boosted the scores while Evil Dead (7.6), RocknRolla (7.3) and The Faculty (7.3) helped combat the lower ratings.

**Conclusion:** These averages prove nothing of importance. However, movies that feature pencil violence easily defeated movies that feature [jet ski actions scenes] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/10/24/the-mff-podcast-75-cinematic-jet-ski-action-scenes-are-the-worst/) and that makes me happy.

Do you feel a need to defend the rave scene in Matrix: reloaded? 

I have Spidey's back in Spider-Man 3. Peter Parker is a good dude who was somewhat corrupted by evil space goo. He didn't become pure evil or demonic. He became a jerky guy who danced a lot and was kind of a punk. I love that evil space goo couldn't make Peter Parker evil. It just made him a dancing jerk. [Birth. Movies.

9,"According to nonsensical evidence (Vin Diesel's prior films, third films in a franchise, jet ski-esque action scenes) I think xXx: Return of Xander Cage will receive a 36% Rotten Tomatoes critic rating. I want to start off by saying that I am rooting for xXx: Return of Xander Cage to succeed because the world needs a superhero who dirt bikes on top of water and skis down heavily forested mountains. Watch the trailer and you will be hoping the movie is a lot of fun as well.

The following prediction is a collection of random scores that may or may not predict the RT critical score. I’m putting my reputation on the line and this prediction could make or break me.

I’m predicting  xXx: Return of Xander Cage will have a 36% score as of Monday 01/23. Here is how I came to that conclusion

1. I averaged the RT scores of xXx, The Last Witch Hunter, Babylon A.D., A Man Apart, Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick and Riddick and 32.5% was the result. The most interesting aspect of the data is that Riddick had the highest score of the bunch. Its 58% RT score outperformed Pitch Black (57%) and XXX (48%). This could mean good news for xXx: Return of Xander Cage.

2. Director DJ. Caruso’s wide release films have an average RT rating of 28.6%. Taking Lives, Two for the Money, Disturbia, Eagle Eye, The Disappointments Room and I Am Number Four did not do well with critics. The only fresh rating belonged to Disturbia and its 69%

3. Since the new xXx film features an insane Dirt bike as a jet ski action scene I decided to add in my [calculations for jet ski action scenes] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5ckqc0/movies_that_feature_jet_ski_action_scenes_have_an/) into the mix. Movies that feature jet ski action scenes have an average 29% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. 

4. The average rating of  third films in recent/similar action films have an average RT rating of 33.1%. Transporter 3, The Expendables 3, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, Blade: Trinity, Bourne Ultimatum, Rush Hour 3, Taken 3 and Tokyo Drift were aided greatly by the 93% of The Bourne Ultimatum. 
The average of these four scores is 30.8%. Normally, I would just use this score as my prediction. However, since Riddick was the third film and had a 58% RT score I’m gonna add another five points to the overall score. Thus, the final product is 35.8% (rounded to 36%) which is higher than the average of Vin’s other action films that he headlined.

Random data says that xXx: Return of Xander Cage will not do well with critics. Let’s hope I’m wrong and it wins Vin his first Oscar."

9,"175 remakes received wide theatrical releases between 2001-2015. 41 have positive critic/audience scores, Only 11 had sequels, and only one sequel made more than its predecessor. However, they've made an international average of $150 million on $60 million budgets. I've always been interested in random statistics [(reddit seemed to love my jet ski data)] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5ckqc0/movies_that_feature_jet_ski_action_scenes_have_an/) and I wanted to figure out the [numbers behind the 21st century remakes (there were a lot of numbers)] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/09/20/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-embrace-the-remake/).

The average critic (Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic)/audience (IMDb) score for the movies and their sequels is a lowly 49.1%. Only 41 of the remakes have a “fresh” 60% or above critic/audience rating which means only 23% are viewed favorably. Also, it is really hard to spin-off sequels from remakes. 11 of the 175 films had sequels and only the Ocean’s and The Texas Chainsaw films were lucky enough to have a third (Ocean’s 13, Texas Chainsaw 3D). The only remake sequel to best its predecessor was Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. The sequel had the luxury of featuring The Rock but even then the return on investment was close from 324% to 303% (#bringbackBrendanFraser).

Remakes may be less lucrative than 21st century reboots (Star Trek, James Bond, The Amazing Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Pan etc..) which average $414 million worldwide. However, remakes have a higher ROI (163.12>157.46) and their average budgets are much lower ($60,000,000 < $148,000,000) which means marketing expenses are not as high.

When I started looking at the theatrical return on investment (ROI) I found out some interesting things. Horror remakes and PG-rated films have the highest ROI because the budgets (sans Disney films) are lower, horror fans will watch anything and parents need to take their kids to movies. 

There were 20 released in 2005 and only five in 2015. I think that is because the 2000s were loaded with horror remakes and they flooded the theaters endlessly. 

Basically, remakes are cheap and more often than not recoup their budgets. Thus, they are safe. "

I don't think it is for everyone (the people next to me in the theater said they should've watched The Accountant) but it felt like such a beautiful wide release outlier.

Independence Day taught us that we should punch jerky aliens in their stupid faces. I recently rewatched The Arrival (1996) after watching Arrival. Both movies focus on communication and listening (and Charlie Sheen saying that he felt like a ""can of smashed assholes""). I started thinking about Signs and realized it had themes of faith and family, Then, I remembered Will Smith punching that stupid alien in the face in Independence Day. He literally knocked it out with one-punch. The alien had on a crazy exoskeleton shield and Smith still turned its lights out.

Whether it be David Spade in The Do-Over or Josh Brolin in Hail, Caesar! there have been a whole lot of mustaches featured in 2016. 

Here are the top 10 mustaches of 2016:

1. Aaron Eckhart - Sully
2. Kurt Russell - Deepwater Horizon
3. Denzel Washington - The Magnificent Seven
4. Glen Powell - Everybody Wants Some!!
5. Jeff Bridges - Hell or High Water
6. Samuel L. Jackson - The Legend of Tarzan
7. Dan Fogler - Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
8. Bryan Cranston - The Infiltrator
9. Jamie Dornan - The Siege of Jadotville
10. Taron Egerton - Eddie the Eagle

9,"I'd love it if Gareth Evans (The Raid) directed an Obi-Wan Kenobi standalone film. He could keep the budget relatively low and I'd love to see his Jedi-infused action scenes. With [news/rumors] (http://collider.com/star-wars-obi-wan-kenobi-solo-movie-update/) coming out that Ewan McGregor might be featured in Episode VIII it got me thinking about a standalone film. Last year [somebody on reddit] (https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/3ezm1i/would_you_want_to_see_a_stand_alone_obiwan_kenobi/) had a great idea about making it a simple chase film.

I think a chase film taking place in Tatooine would be amazing. Maybe somebody figured out Luke's location and is rushing back to civilization to relay the news. This causes Obi-Wan to jump into action and the following chase film would open up the Tatooine world. 

I think Gareth Evans would be perfect because he knows action and character. The Raid 2 was epic and the budget was only $4.5 million. Imagine if he and Iko Uwais had $100 million! This is all speculation, but I'd love to see it. "
9,"Brendan Fraser’s cameos as Encino Man’s Link in Son in Law and In the Army Now suggest the three films exist in the same world. So, that means Pauly Shore’s Stoney character is a clone, has twin brothers, suffered amnesia or entered the witness protection program. I love that Brendan Fraser's Link character pops up in Son in Law and In the Army Now. However, it means there are several Pauly Shore's existing in the same world at the same time. They don't know about each other and all seem to be doing their own thing. 

They could either be clones (think Orphan Black), twins, or Stoney had to go into hiding and Link is watching over him. I know it is a simple in-joke that Link is featured, but it opens up some fun questions about Weasel and his clones/twins. 

What happened to Link, Weasel and Dave in Encino Man? They had a pretty tight friendship but it looks like Link took off and forged his own path and eventually joined the military. It is kind of a sad story. "
9,"The 2010s have been loaded with a wide variety of really good science fiction films. I've loved Ex Machina, Looper, Arrival, Edge of Tomorrow, Safety Not Guaranteed, Source Code, Melancholia, Coherence, Attack the Block, Upstream Color, Her, Interstellar and Snowpiercer. After watching Arrival I started thinking about other science fiction films released in the 2010s. I kept rattling off names (like Bubba talking about shrimp) and it dawned on me that we've had some killer science fiction movies released this decade. 

Between the movies mentioned above and The Lobster, Rise of the Planets of the Apes, Cloud Atlas, Under the Skin, Predestination, Tron: Legacy, Gravity, Super 8, Monsters, Mad Max: Fury Road, Europa Report, Lucy and The Martian* we've been pretty lucky.

What are your favorite science fiction films of this decade? "
9,"Movies that feature jet ski action scenes have an average RT rating of 29% and average an inflated domestic box office of $49 million on $82 million budgets. Here are the movies: In case you were wondering the Metacritic average is 34% (not much of an increase). 

*[Transporter 2] (https://youtu.be/WpIcaHiKB1s), [Transporter: Refueled] (https://youtu.be/qPiwceD9xpw), Police Academy 3, Waterworld, Hard Rain, Deep Rising, Speed 2, Shark Night, Fool's Gold,
Double Dragon, Piranha 3D*, The Pacifier/You Don't Mess with the Zohan*

Jet Ski action scenes are boring. They basically go in a straight line or are totally unwieldy indoors [(Hard Rain)] (https://youtu.be/ZKTMxF2PrHM). Also, when you wipe out there is no danger because the characters simply flop on the water [(Fool's Gold)] (https://youtu.be/VY4Bo_Mcws4).  I'm not saying the movies are subpar because of jet skis. I'm just saying jet ski action scenes don't help.

I also looked up movies that feature jet ski riding. The films *Tomb Raider 2*, *Jack & Jill* *Caddyshack*, *50 First Dates*, *Billy Madison* *Point Break (remake)*, *Blue Crush*, *Tammy*, *[Hitch] (https://youtu.be/eKKd33QEB3I)*, *The Spy Who Loved Me*, *[Jackass 3D] (https://youtu.be/XkqEPoKTyrI)* and *Into the Blue* have an average of 44.8% on RT. That isn't too bad. Maybe just feature some casual jet ski cruising and it will make your movie better. If you are interested there is a [podcast that dives deeper into the world of bad jet ski action scenes] (http://www.blogtalkradio.com/moviesfilmsandflix/2016/10/23/episode-75-sea-doont)."
9,"Jeff Nichols first five films (Shotgun Stories, Take Shelter, Mud, Midnight Special, Loving) have an average 90.8% RT critic rating. The only director I could find with a higher average is Hayao Miyazaki. That is really impressive. The 90.8% average for his first five films is higher than the first five films of Wes Anderson, Martin Scorsese, Brad Bird, Ang Lee, David Gordon Green, Ron Howard, Robert Altman, Terrence Malick, Alfred Hitchcock, Katheryn Bigelow, James Cameron, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg,  and Akira Kurosawa. This is an incredible feat considering the amount of talented directors that have been making films for decades.

Also, I love how Nichols writes his own films and makes sure to have final cut for each. [I think he is the best working director today] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/11/07/five-reasons-why-jeff-nichols-is-the-best-working-director-today/). 

*There weren't RT scores for Miyazaki's first two entries. However, it seems like they are only 24 minute short films. So I used his 3rd-7th films. [Here is his RT page] (https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/hayao_miyazaki/)

9,"Who is your favorite cinematic president? I gotta go with Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camcho from Idiocracy or Tug ""sabotage...what does it mean?"" Benson from Hot Shots! Part Deux. Here are my top five:

*Thomas J. Whitmore – Independence Day* - The dude flies into battle and makes great speeches. 


*Tom Beck – Deep Impact* - Only Tom Beck can make the end of the world sound reassuring. 


*Merkin Muffley – Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb* - Greatest phone conversation ever!


*Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho* – Idiocracy -
Terry Crews is the best. 


*Tug Benson - Hots Shots! Part Deux* - He is indestructible and might be a jedi.  

Who is your favorite cinematic president? Let me know. "
9,"What movies deserve a participation medal? I think Jupiter Ascending deserves one because it created a new world, told an original story and featured intergalactic roller skating. Jupiter Ascending did not win any awards. However, it tried really hard and featured a whole lot of insanity packed into two hours. Any movies that feature immortal nut shots, Eddie Redmayne overacting and Sean Bean (or BEEan) playing a guy named Stinger because he is spliced with bees is cool with me. 

What movies should receive a participation medal? "
9,"Between Airplane!, Top Secret! The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!, Hot Shots!, Hot Shots! Part Deux and Mafia!, David Zucker and Jim Abrahams loved exclamation marks. I just saw that Top Secret! is streaming on Amazon Prime and it got me thinking about other Abrahams/Zucker films. It dawned on me that they sure do love exclamation marks. I guess it makes sense because they are insane movies.

I appreciate all their films and think Mafia! and Top Secret! are kinda underrated. If I had to pick a favorite I'd have to go with Hot Shots! Part Deux. I've watched it countless time and it never gets old. Whether it be Charlie Sheen dunking his hands in caramel or Lloyd Bridges farting the movie never loses its luster. I quote it all the time (I see a couple gulls) and recommend it to unsuspecting people whenever I can. "
9,"Trantor the troll from Ernest Scared Stupid is one of the scariest characters ever in a PG rated film. He exclusively hunted children, his attacks had no pattern and Pure Bulgarian Miak didn't faze him. Trantor the troll crushed my nine year old soul. I was expecting a funny Ernest movie and got the sh** scared out of me. I know the movie doesn't hold up when you are older, but when you are nine that movie is the worst because you weren't expecting it to be scary. Also, he attacked whoever was convenient and went as far to hide on top of your bed or modulate his voice to capture you."
9,"I love how Deep Blue Sea features creative deaths, dumb action scenes, legit practical effects and terrible CGI. Deep Blue Sea is my favorite guilty pleasure. It blends some amazing deaths with pure stupidity and manages to be a lot of fun. I was working in a movie theater when it was released and people went crazy for it. To this day, I've never witnessed people having so much fun in a movie theater.  I understand why it was featured on the podcast [How Did This Get Made] (http://www.earwolf.com/episode/deep-blue-sea-live/) but I still think it is awesome. It is the rare bad film that [Roger Ebert still loved] (http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deep-blue-sea-1999)."
9,"I am 92.137% certain this selection of streaming horror films will help you pick a horror movie to watch on Halloween. I came up with 16 categories and in those categories I’ve given you a main option and a backup in case you don’t like the first recommendation. Hopefully you can find something you will enjoy. An added bonus is that all of these films are streaming on either Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, HBO GO, Crackle or Shudder.

Check out the [horror movie streaming calendar I made to check out other streaming options] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/09/27/the-mff-halloween-horror-calendar-31-streaming-films-for-31-days/) in case you are in the 7.863% that didn't find a film to watch in the list below. If you still haven't found anything watch Drag Me to Hell or Halloween. That should cover it all....I hope. 


**If you are in the mood for…..**


**1. A dinner party that goes terribly awry**

**The Invitation (Netflix)** – What I love about The Invitation is how it builds to an amazing final shot. You won’t find a better ending to any 2016 film because it actually earns it. Director Karyn Kusama has created a world that is loaded with excellent performances, lots of questions and tons of suspense.

**If you aren’t interested. We Are What We Are (Netflix)** – You don’t want to be the guest at one of the Parker’s dinner parties.


**2. A witch who turns babies into goo**

**The Witch (Amazon Prime)** – There are things in The Witch that you will never forget. Director Robert Eggers quest for authenticity paid off and you find yourself immersed in a terrifying world. If you are into beautiful/terrible imagery and slow burn tension you will love every second of The Witch.

**If you aren’t interested: Rosemary’s Baby (Amazon Prime)** – The two films are incredibly different but they both revolve around witches/cults and terrible things happening to babies.


**3. A thing that never stops following you**

**It Follows (Hulu- Showtime)** – What I love about It Follows is how it is loaded with urgency, patience and dread. It never stops and it keeps you in a constant state of alert because you don’t know where the following creature will pop up next. That is perfect for Halloween horror!

**If you aren’t interested: The Descent (Hulu – Showtime)** – The Descent is one of my favorite horror films and I love how it becomes a brutal and urgent survival film. You will never be able to catch your breath during The Descent.


**4. An evil space ship**

**Event Horizon (Netflix)** – If you are looking for a cult classic that is loaded with great actors and insane imagery you will love Event Horizon. It is director Paul Anderson’s best film and the visions of hell will be burnt into your memory.

**If you aren’t interested: Let Us Prey (Netflix, Shudder)** – Let Us Prey is a nasty little film that might as well take place in a hell ship. If you are into gore and insanity you will appreciate this film.


**5. A killer who doesn’t have a lame backstory**

**Hush (Netflix)** – Hush is a fantastic horror film  that does a lot with little and Netflix should be stoked they are streaming it exclusively. I love the film because it plays very practically and features a nameless villain that doesn’t need a backstory or motives. Hush is smart, exciting, and wonderfully simple.


**If you aren’t interested: Final Destination (Amazon Prime)** – There is nothing worse than Death trying to kill you. You will wish the nameless guy from Hush was coming after you.


**6. A stupid red-faced demon who pops up at the worst moments**

**Insidious (Crackle)** – Insidious catapulted director James Wan back into the mainstream and featured one of the best jump scares ever. Insidious is one of my favorite 21st century horror films because it features a good family being terrorized by terrible evil. They’ve done nothing wrong and I love that they actually move away from the haunted house and put their lives on the line to save each other. Insidious is a horror movie with heart.


**If you aren’t interested: Poltergeist (HBO GO)** – Is a horror classic that has influenced countless films. That damn clown is never not scary.


**7. A killer in training**

**Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon (Shudder)** – It takes a lot of work to become a movie killer. You need to train, walk fast and created overly elaborate backstories. However, if you do everything right you will become a horror legend and star in a very fun cult classic. I love how Behind the Mask pokes fun at horror cliches and then totally subverts all of them.

**If you aren’t interested: Tucker & Dale vs. Evil (Shudder, Netflix)** – T&D is horror comedy at its best and I love how it successfully subverts the genre while bringing the gore.


**8. A babysitter in a creepy house**

**The House of the Devil (Shudder – Hulu)** – If you are into babysitters being harassed then you will love The House of the Devil. It is an audacious horror film that builds to an incredibly tense and soul crushing conclusion. Director Ti West (The Innkeepers, The Sacrament) is a master of horror and I love that he had the confidence to build to such a crazy ending.

**If you aren’t interested: The Babadook (Netflix)** – There two films are incredibly different. However, they build tension beautifully and feature directors who will be making big waves in horror.


**9. Really fast people who are infected with rage**

**28 Days Later (HBO GO)** – Danny Boyle is my hero and 28 Days Later is my favorite “zombie” film. It is the most tension filled horror 100 minutes of the 21st century and it just doesn’t age.  I watch it every Halloween and it seems to get better and better. I love the soundtrack, crazy scares and the opening featuring an empty London freaks me out every time.


**If you aren’t interested: Dead Snow (Shudder, Netflix)** – What is worse than rage infected zombies? Nazi zombies.


**10. A hit-man getting into some really weird stuff**

**Kill List (Shudder, Hulu)** – Director Ben Wheatley is a maniac director and Kill List is a journey into madness. I love how it starts off as a hit-man film and slowly devolves into crazy cult shenanigans. Kill List might be the most underrated horror film of recent years and I put it on the list so more people will watch it.

**If you aren’t interested: Black Death (Shudder)** – Black Death won’t leave you feeling happy. However, any movie called Black Death shouldn’t be an easy watch.


**11. A cabinet owned by a Doctor**

**The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Netflix, Shudder)** – If you want to watch an OG movie that is beautiful to look at and might be the first horror films ever made. It is one of the first true horror films and I love the German expressionism and long lasting images. Do yourself a favor and watch a true horror original.


**If you aren’t interested: Nosferatu (Shudder)** – What happens when you can’t get the rights to Dracula? You make a movie called Nosferatu and influence horror movies forever…..Then, you get sued.


**12. A Wes Craven classic**

**The Hills Have Eyes (Shudder)** – Wes Craven was a maniac back in the day. His films were angry, brutal and iconic. If you are looking for a classic of the horror genre you will love The Hills Have Eyes. It is a brutal experience that never gets old and features some of the most frightening villains ever.


**If you aren’t interested: Re-Animator (Shudder, Amazon Prime)** – Re-Animator is a fantastic cult classic that needs to be watched by more people. You will love every second of it.


**13. The best vampire film of the 21st century**

**Let the Right One In (Shudder, Amazon Prime)** – Let the Right One In is the rare horror film that transcends the genre because every element of it is great. It is beloved by critics and horror hounds because it tells a heartbreaking story while featuring lots and lots of blood. You won’t find a better vampire movie out there because there aren’t any.


**If you aren’t interested: From Dusk Till Dawn (Amazon Prime, Netflix)** – From Dusk Till Dawn ain’t subtle like Let the Right One In. However, it is a well made splatterfest that is lots of fun.


**14. Zombies coming for someone named Barbara**

**Night of the Living Dead  (Shudder)** – George Romero helped changed the horror world in 1968 with Night of the Living Dead. If you haven’t watched this classic yet I totally recommend you watch it on Halloween. I guarantee you will love this classic because it is a pure horror film that was created by people who loved the genre and wanted to create something new and exciting.

**If you aren’t interested: Pontypool (Netflix)** – Pontypool is a single location zombie movie that uses its location perfectly and is a really neat head trip. If you are into low budget independent horror that hits above its weight you will really appreciate Pontypool.


**15. Drunk people battling aliens**

**Grabbers (Shudder)** – Grabbers tells the incredibly true story (lie) of drunk Irish villagers battling jerky aliens. It is perfection,  and I love how it embraces absurdity and everyone seems to be having fun. If you are looking for something cheeky and scary it doesn’t get any better than Grabbers.

**If you aren’t interested: Tremors (Amazon Prime)** – Tremors is pure creature feature fun. I’ve watched it over 20 times and it never gets old. Viva la Bacon!


**16. A descent into madness**

**I Saw the Devil (Amazon Prime, Shudder)** – If you want to put your soul in a headlock you need to watch I Saw the Devil. It is brilliant, tough and beautiful to look at. I think I Saw the Devil might be the best horror film of the last 10 years because it balances amazing performances, lots of blood and a truly scary villain.

**If you aren’t interested: A Tale of Two Sisters (Shudder)** – Embrace the Korean weirdness. You will love it."

"
9,"What are five 21st century horror films you feel like everyone should watch? 1. *Drag Me to Hell* - It is Sam Raimi at his best and I love how he combines horror with oddball humor. Also, the car park fight is probably my favorite thing ever.


2. *The Descent* - Neil Marshall did such a brilliant job with The Descent. The action is urgent and even the spelunking is crazy tense.


3. *28 Days Later* - Danny Boyle is the bomb and I love how he infected people with rage and really influenced the zombie genre. Also, I love the music a lot.


4. *I Saw the Devil* - I know it is kind of a thriller but I think it is a perfect descent into madness. It is insanity done right and the performances are stellar.


5. *Let the Right One In* - It is brutal, bloody and beautiful. I normally forget about a lot of horror but this movie has stayed in my mind. It is perfection."

9,"The Ring (2002) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) are the most trendsetting horror films of the 21st century. They kickstarted the remake world into hyperdrive and were directly/indirectly responsible for 35+ horror remakes. There have been 175 theatrically released remakes in the 21st century. The Ring and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre are somewhat responsible for around 20% of them. They were massive hits and  part of the reason why there were 20 theatrically released remakes in 2005 (lots of 2005 horror). They've since run their course (only 5 remakes in 2015), but it is really impressive that [two remakes had such an impact and still leave a bad remake taste in people's mouths] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/09/20/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-embrace-the-remake/)

I think the reason why is The Ring was actually good [(voted one of the best of the 21st century)] (http://www.avclub.com/article/and-now-internet-has-voted-best-horror-film-21st-c-224004) and Texas Chainsaw was one of the first to glossily remake a classic horror property. They felt fresh even though they were remakes. 

reboots, sequels and [rebootquels] (http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/12/31/the-year-in-rebootquels) are trending now but we are probably one really good remake away from more remakes. "
9,"31 is what happens when Rob Zombie goes full ""Rob Zombie."" It is gritty, satisfied with itself and lacks the quality featured in The Devil's Rejects. I watched an early screening last night and felt like the film was too 'Rob Zombie."" It was gross, violent, profane and kinda boring. I remember walking out of Devil's Rejects and Halloween feeling burnt out and tired (in a good way). 31 felt mediocre."
9,"The Lobster made me reconsider the usage of toasters. What other movies have used household appliances uniquely? I don't want to give anything away but there is a scene in The lobster where a toaster is used as a punishment. It felt normal that they would do that with a toaster in that world (it is a weird world).

What movies have used appliances differently? "
9,"What is your favorite film of 2016 so far? Everybody Wants Some!! is by far the best. Richard Linklater's ensemble movie about an 1980s college baseball team is relatable, fun and likable. Richard Linklater is the best. I love Everybody Wants Some and appreciate that he can create unique and likable characters in a massive ensemble comedy. Don't be thrown off by the baseball players. Linklater knows what he is doing and I think everyone can relate to it. 

Top five of the year so far:

1. Everybody Wants Some
2. The Lobster
3. Green Room
4. Hail, Caesar
5. Midnight Special"
9,"The James Gunn directed Slither (2006) and Super (2010) were perfect warm ups for his Marvel debut Guardians of the Galaxy. They featured aliens, ""superheroes,"" and a-holes battling even bigger a-holes I love [Slither] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439815/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) and [Super] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1512235/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_7). They were loaded with ""heroes"" who had too much muscle mass to get drunk (Nathan Fillion is the best). Between the alien invasion of Slither, and the weird ""superheroes"" of Super, James Gunn was an inspired choice to direct Guardians of the Galaxy.


Slither totally deserves its spot as one of the [best horror films to not be on a ""best of"" list] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2015/08/24/mff-reader-poll-results-what-are-your-favorite-21st-century-horror-films-that-wont-appear-on-best-of-lists/) and Super is pure insanity. "
9,"Adam's Sandler's 20-year run since Billy Madison has been impressive considering he's stayed away from good scripts and press obligations. His 24 ""Sandler"" films have averaged $157 million domestically and his last five theatrically released ""Sandler"" films collected $1.3 billion internationally. Other actors have made more money, won Oscars and worked with great directors. Sandler has stayed relevant in movies that feature [Dave Matthews picking up coconuts with his butt] (https://youtu.be/7wWZ4eF_o60). I'm not saying he is the best actor or the biggest box office draw. I'm saying no other actor could make a a movie about a hair dresser/commando and have it make $200 internationally. 
 
Adam Sandler has had a [very impressive 20 year run] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/08/11/you-can-do-it-a-look-at-adam-sandlers-epic-20-year-run/). His ""Adam Sandler films (Waterboy, Little Nicky, Jack & Jill etc....) have collected $3.7 billion at the box office while being critically destroyed. He does zero press and and only started doing sequels when he had a bad run with Jack & Jill and That's My Boy.  

His last five theatrically released movies have made over $1.35 billion despite the news that he is [done as a box office draw] (http://variety.com/2015/film/news/adam-sandler-pixels-flop-movie-star-1201549330/). Also, his Netflix deal has been successful considering [The Ridiculous 6 is the most watched film in Netflix history] (http://www.slashfilm.com/netflix-ridiculous-6/) despite a 0% RT average.

There are better actors who are more ambitious and creative. However, Sandler has a loyal fanbase and he's been able to adapt and stay relevant. He's been in some great films (Punch Drunk Love, Funny People) and his production company Happy Madison has churned out some hits and cult comedies (Paul Blart, Grandma's Boy, Joe Dirt). 

Not bad for the Billy Madison guy.  

"
9,"2001-2002 was loaded with comedy cult classics. I love Wet Hot American Summer, Super Troopers, Zoolander, Joe Dirt, Pootie Tang, Out Cold, Ghost World, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist, Bubba Ho-Tep and Death to Smoochy. Kung Pow: Enter the Fist was on the other day and it got me thinking about comedy cult films. 2001-2002 was really strong for cult classics. 

Here are some of the films: Wet Hot American Summer, Zoolander, Super Troopers, Not Another Teen Movie, Joe Dirt, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist, Out Cold, Pootie Tang, Bubba Ho-Tep, Death to Smoochy, Punch Drunk Love. Secretary,  Ghost World, Hedwig and the Angry Inch,  Made, Bubble Boy, 24-Hour Party People, How High, Freddy got Fingered and Jay and Bob Strike Back.

That is a solid list of good, bad, and so bad they're great films. 
"
9,"What I love about World War Z is it doesn't allow you to catch your breath for the first two-thirds of the film. Then, the scaled-down finale makes you hold your breath. I love World War Z. I'm amazed it works so well considering all the problems the production had. In the end, it is a fast-paced big budget film that moves quickly, then becomes a crazy suspenseful (due to reshoots) little film. I dig it. "
9,"What movie characters do you think could win gold medals at the summer Olympics? I got E.T. for BMX Cycling and Snake Plissken for the Modern Pentathlon I guarantee the rule committee has no clause against flying BMX bicycles. Thus, E.T. wins on a loophole. Also, Snake completed the first science fiction pentathlon (Motorcycle riding, basketball, surfing, hang gliding) so I think the modern one will be easy.

What movie characters could win gold? "
9,"If you combined the plots of your two favorite films what would the movie be like? I'd have Dr. Jaws, the story of an insane general unleashing super sharks onto the world's populace. Dr. Jaws sounds like Sharknado met Deep Blue Sea and spawned a cold war film. I'd pay to see it."
9,"When I was 12 I thought Ferris Bueller was cool. When I was 18 I thought he was awesome. Now I'm in my 30s and I think he is a punk teenager. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a fantastic film but my thoughts on Ferris have changed a lot. I watched it recently and I hated how he treated everyone around him. The dude lies, cheats and lies more to get what he wants. I still like the character and the film, but now that I'm older I think he is a punk anti-hero.  "
9,I love that Premium Rush exists. It is a live action cartoon that tells the story of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's hotshot bicycle messenger being hunted down by the beautifully overacting Michael Shannon. Premium Rush was directed by David Koepp (writer of Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) and it plays out like a live action cartoon featuring characters named Wilee and Bobby Monday. I love that it features two great actors running around like maniacs. They both went totally in on the insanity and it feels like something different. 
9,"the direct-to-DVD Tremors sequels do a solid job of maintaining the originals cheeky tone. They are fun little films that are anchored by an always game Michael Gross. I love the first Tremors. It is a perfect little monster feature that is fun, exciting and holds up on multiple viewings. The sequels ain't Shakespeare, but they are much better than they have any right to be. I like the Tremors world and the reoccurring characters that appear in each film. "
9,"With 10 Cloverfield Lane and Hush, John Gallagher Jr. has the market cornered on 2016 horror(ish) thrillers that basically take place in a single location and feature strong female leads, fantastic villains and only a few actors. I really liked Hush and 10 Cloverfield Lane. They are solid low-budget films that have a combined 95% RT average and are some of the [highest hated horror films of this decade] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/06/22/what-is-the-best-horror-film-of-the-2010s-so-far-an-in-depth-look-at-critical-and-audience-scores/). They feature really good performances from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Kate Siegel, and I appreciate how they aren't ultra stylized. 

John Gallagher Jr. plays two totally different roles in the films and he is effective in both. I don't want to give anything away but his character in Hush is an incredibly effective villain. There are no bells and whistles. The dude just wants to kill. I am totally in support of Hush director [Mike Flanagan directing the Halloween reboot] (http://www.avclub.com/article/hushs-mike-flanagan-already-talks-new-halloween-237275). I'd rather have more original stories but I think if it has to happen Flanagan is a good pick. 

"
9,"I love the Fright Night remake. David Tennant is fantastic, Colin Farrell seems to be having a lot of fun, and Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots have great chemistry. What horror remakes do you like? I watched the Fright Night remake at a Drive-in back in 2011 and had a great time. It isn't a horror classic but it features solid performances, fun scares and David Tennant owning the screen. It is one of the best horror remakes and after the news about Anton Yelchin I watched it again. Fun film. Also, I was stoked to see Poots and Yelchin together again in Green Room. Two solid films. 

What horror remakes do you like?"
9,"Adam Sandler's Netflix deal was a great idea. He doesn't have to worry about box office disappointment, and his films can break all of Netflix's records. His fans will watch regardless of the bad reviews, and Netflix makes it easier to hate-watch. Either way it is more press. Ridiculous 6 is the [most watched movie in Netflix history] (http://www.slashfilm.com/netflix-ridiculous-6/) and [The Do-Over] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/06/17/the-do-over-exactly-what-youd-expect-from-a-2016-adam-sandler-movie/) will probably do really well. 

I think the deal was smart because the negative reviews actually get it more press. People will be curious and will watch. Also, if you are a Sandler fan or completest you don't care about the bad reviews. You are happy his movies are on Netflix. It is a win-win situation. "
9,"From Anchorman to Commando: These 10 incredibly random workouts/tips will get you in fictional character shape. Working out isn't for everybody. However, these 10 examples of cinematic working out can be a great place to start. These 10 workouts/tips worked for fictional characters so they will be perfect for you. If you want to see the [clips/pics you can check them out here] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/06/10/the-mff-workout-system-10-cinematic-tips-to-becoming-ripped/).

Sidenote: No matter how much you work out you will never rival Ron Burgundy. 


**1. Exaggeration Curls – Anchorman**

Do you not want to workout because you are afraid what people will think? If you answered “yes” you should pull a Ron Burgundy and confuse everybody by doing exaggeration curls. The trick is to exaggerate your numbers every time people walk by. People will know you are lying, but they won’t know you only did four curls.

You can use this system for all the workouts below.


**2. Corona Curls – Fast and the Furious films.**

Everybody in the Fast movies are ripped. How do they stay so svelte? The short answer is Corona curls. Basically, drink Corona bottles constantly and fling them at your face like you’ve never drank corona before. The trick is to ignore all drinking logic and invent new ways to make beer explode in your face.


**3. Wear a Knee Brace – The Dark Knight Rises**

Have you been out of action for a while and need to get back in shape quickly? Wear a knee brace. It worked in The Dark Knight Rises. I have no idea how the knee brace cured all of Batman’s physical woes but movies never lie.


**4. Master the Ben Affleck Gratuitous Pull-Up – The Town & Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice**

Ben Affleck loves to show off his pull-up skills. In The Town and BvS he had no problem lifting himself up on metal bars. If you have a door frame or bat cave, I recommend you put up a pull-up bar and get to work. An added bonus is all the gratuitous pull-ups you can do at parties you host.


**5. Become an Actor and Get Cast as Wolverine – Way too Many X-Men Movies**

Hugh Jackman has been ripped for a long time. The guy always has a Wolverine movie around the corner so he needs to be in fighting shape 24/7. Start acting now!


**6. Have Somebody Forcefully Make You Do the Splits – Bloodsport**

JCVD is always doing the splits. They’ve aided him in many films and gotten him out of trouble on several occasions. If you watch JCVD movies you know the splits make you invincible.


**7. Master Movie Trailer Yoga – Edge of Tomorrow**

Rita Vrataski was absolutely shredded in Edge of Tomorrow. Her major workout was movie trailer yoga. What is movie trailer yoga? It features moves that look really cool and show off all the muscles. There is no need to learn anything intricate, just do what looks cool.


**8. Carry Logs Around – Commando & Rocky IV**

You don’t need to buy weights when you have tree trucks and logs lying around. They are nature’s bar bells and you can do anything with them. Whether you want to improve endurance or show off your biceps these dead trees are perfect for you. An added bonus is you can use them for fire’s later on.


**9. Run in Sand, Mud or Snow – Rocky IV, Rocky III, Chariots of Fire, 10, Best of the Best and Naked Gun**

The trick is to run on surfaces that aren’t concrete. Movies have taught me that beach/snow/mud running is the greatest exercises of all. Get outside and run on the beach or tundra.


**10. Master the one-arm pushup – G.I. Jane**

It worked for Demi Moore in G.I. Jane and it can work for you.  I don’t recommend you do the majority of these exercises in this video because you will 100% hurt yourself (chair pushups?). Start with regular pushups and work your way up to being a one-arm pushup master. It will take some time but if you’ve been doing the above exercises they will be easy.

Sidenote: You don’t have to shave your head.

What other workouts am I missing?"
9,"Green Room is the best thriller I've seen in years. I love how director Jeremy Saulnier puts people in over their heads and the resulting violence is clumsy, brutal and unexpected. Jeremy Saulnier's movies [Green Room] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/05/05/green-room-the-best-thriller-in-years/) and [Blue Ruin] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2014/08/27/blue-ruin-tension-perfected/) are fantastic.  They are dripping with authenticity and the violence is insane. You never know what is going to happen next because the main characters have no clue. If you haven't watched them do it now. "
9,"If you exclude Cutthroat Island, Renny Harlin made some killer films from 1990 to 1999. I love Deep Blue Sea, Long Kiss Goodnight, Cliffhanger and Die Hard 2. The 2000's weren't kind (Mindhunters, Exorcist, Driven, Covenant, Cleaner) but Harlin made some very fun 1990's action films. The dude blended story and violence with enough surprises (think Sam Jackson in Deep Blue Sea) to give his action films some serious legs. What is your favorite Renny Harlin film?  "
9,"What is your favorite Seven Samurai inspired film? I love 13 Assassins. It is a perfect mixture of blood, story and likable/despicable characters. I just watched the new Magnificent Seven trailer and it got me thinking about all the films The Seven Samurai inspired. What is your favorite? "
9,"What random ""vs."" movie would you want to watch? I'd love to see Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver) square off against Alex (Clockwork Orange). The movie would be called Uber Ultra-Violence. What random vs. movies would you want to watch? I recently listened to a [funny podcast about vs. movies] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/04/15/the-mff-podcast-54-vs-movies-that-need-to-happen/) and it got me thinking. 

1. Jason Voorhees (Friday the 13th) vs. Death (Final Destination) - I think Death would quit.


2. Hugh Glass (The Revenant) vs. Edward Malus (The Wicker Man) - Could Glass survive Nic Cage in a bear suit?

3. King Kong (King Kong) vs. Alonzo Harris (Training Day) - Let's see Alonzo back up his words. "
9,"Jeff Nichols did a great job giving Midnight Special an Amblin feel while still making his own unique film. I love that he didn't rely on nostalgia or mimicry, and instead built a new world with its own ideas. What makes [Midnight Special] (https://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/04/12/midnight-special-the-best-film-of-2016-so-far/) so great is it plays like a classic Amblin film (Back to the Future, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Gremlins, E.T.) that avoids mimicry (think Super 8). It is its own beast that creates a new world full of heart, excitement and wonder. The end product is a beautiful science fiction film about parents doing all they can to protect their child."
9,"Do you think Crimson Peak's poor box office performance was because of the ""horror"" Marketing. Or, do you think it is really hard to market an R-rated Gothic romance that features ghosts and gore? I really enjoyed [Crimson Peak] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/04/03/crimson-peak-when-an-r-rated-gothic-romance-met-the-marketing-department/) and thought it looked absolutely beautiful. I've been reading some articles lately that have [blamed the marketing] (http://www.pajiba.com/miscellaneous/a-stongly-worded-letter-to-universals-marketing-department-on-the-subject-of-crimson-peak.php). However, as much as I love the movie, I feel like it is a marketers nightmare. How the hell do you market an R-rated Gothic romance that features gore and ghosts? I love Guillermo del Toro, and think he has [made some classics] (http://www.avclub.com/article/read-whats-best-horror-film-21st-century-223671) but his films are not always initially successfully. "
9,"Batman v Superman reminds me a lot of Prometheus and Pacific Rim. They are massively budgeted films that look amazing, make really weird decisions and have been talked about ad nauseam. As a film fan I love it. I've been devouring every pod ([Kevin Smith's review is great] (https://youtu.be/GDsw86ATrQ0)) and think piece I can find about [Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/03/30/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-a-perfect-example-of-more-creating-less/).  Not many movies have exploded online like BvS, and it has been fun to sit back, relax and read about people losing their minds over every little facet of the film. 

I've also talked about [Prometheus] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2012/11/16/prometheus-2012-vivisected-part-2-the-sea-of-questions-regarding-the-mysterious-black-goo/) and [Pacific Rim] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2013/07/19/pacific-rim-its-all-about-the-monsters-getting-punches-in-the-face/) A LOT. They are absolutely bonkers films that look great but are really dumb when put under the microscope. They are fun to talk about, and I've listened to the Blu-ray commentaries so I can sound more educated when discussing them. 

All three films have raised so many questions.
 
Why didn't they just cover the one portal in Pacific Rim? Why build a wall? Why not surround the portal with robots?  Why did the guy who made maps get lost in Prometheus? Why did they get close to that evil snake thing? Why did Charlize Theron run in a straight line? Can you heal that quickly from surgery?

Which movies do you love talking/debating about?"
9,"I collected a list of 1,300 21st century films, and averaged out their IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores to figure out which 21st century films have the best combined audience/critic score. Spirited Away was the clear winner. I put together the [21st century horror list back in August on Reddit] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3glbbo/i_was_inspired_by_a_recent_reddit_post_and_sorted/) and I've slowly built this list in order to figure out which movies critics and audiences love the most. The following examines which [21st century films have the highest combined audience/critical average] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/03/24/mff-special-the-top-201-audiencecritic-rated-films-of-the-21st-century/). 


I collected critical/user data from three sources:

**IMDb User Votes** – The amount of votes did not matter (1,339 is the minimum on the list). I didn’t want to punish films for not getting wide releases.

**Rotten Tomatoes Critic/Audience Scores** – The films needed at least 40 reviews to be considered. That is par for the course when it comes to RT’s ranking system.

**Metacritic Critic Average**

 
I added the four scores (RT critic/audience, IMDb user, Metacritic critic) together and averaged them out. The averaging process isn’t sophisticated, but, it gives a straightforward look at the averaged scores. I gave the same weight to critic and user ratings despite there being more users. Critics can push the agenda, so their ratings get equal weight. If data was missing from one of the sites I left the movie out of the list.

Here are the top 53 critic/audience rated films of the 21st century. [If you want to see the top 200 you can do so here] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/03/24/mff-special-the-top-201-audiencecritic-rated-films-of-the-21st-century/)

9,"The Tom Hanks/Julia Roberts romance subplot in Larry Crowne is crazy. It centers around a saintly/divorced man who has an affair with a depressed/alcoholic woman who is married to a porn addict. Larry Crowne is a weird movie. There are no conflicts. When Hanks needs a moped he goes next door to his friend’s garage sale and buys a cheap moped. When he needs a job he goes to his friends diner. When he goes to school a guy picks his schedule in two minutes. The biggest stretch is that Larry Crowne immediately sells his house. Did I mention that Julia Roberts quits alcohol easily?

The film fluffily tackles  unemployment, porn addiction, foreclosure, alcoholism, divorce, depression and dropping out of school."

9,"I've loved the recent ""horror"" hybrids (Spring, It Follows, The Witch, The Babadook), but I've noticed they've divided horror fans. So, I put together a list of ""horror"" films that the art-house and hardcore crowds can agree upon. I've loved the recent horror films but I've noticed that they've been dividing audiences. Movies like *The Witch, Bone Tomahawk, Spring, The Guest, The Babadook* and *Creep* all have horror elements but branched out into other genres as well. Thus, an argument has started about whether or not they are actually horror films. I think the above mentioned movies are indeed horror films. However, I added the ""horror"" because of the insane amount of arguments I've read online. For instance, here are what some recent horror films have been called. 

The Babadook = Physiological thriller

Bone Tomahawk = Western thriller

Spring = Science Fiction Love story

I consider these movies to be horror but a lot of people do not. 

Nobody will ever agree because opinions always differ. So, Instead of looking for differences in the genre [I came up with 10 films that can unite the art-house and hardcore horror fans] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/02/26/10-films-that-can-unite-the-hardcore-and-art-house-horror-movie-fans/). These movies are all over the place but they offer something for everyone. I totally recommend you check them out. 


**Trollhunter** (2010) - Trollhunter proves that found footage movies about trolls can be fun, original and occasionally violent.

**Thirst** (2009) - Director Park Chan-wook is amazing.

**Cheap Thrills** (2013) -  Alamo Drafthouse distributed it and they’ve figured out a way to masterfully “destroy the balance between grindhouse and art-house.”

**Bone Tomahawk** (2015) - It is lyrically written and features some crazy ultra-violence.

**Pontypool** (2008) - It does a lot with little and proves genre films can create tension without wiping out co-eds.

**Housebound** (2014) -  It is a cheeky little thing that bounces around genres and features a new type of hero.

**Spring** (2014) - The directors did something crazy and created a new monster!

**Creep** (2014) - Creep creates an original and modern villain.

**I Saw the Devil** (2010) -  It is a beautiful punch to the face.

**Kill List** (2011) - Director Ben Wheatley is a master of combining multiple genres"
9,"What I love about the X-Men, Blade and Spider-Man trilogies is they started strong, got better and then went completely insane. With Deadpool exploding in theaters and Cap 3/Thor 3 on the horizon [I started looking back at the early(ish) Marvel trilogies] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/02/23/bad-movie-tuesday-the-comic-book-trilogy/) before the reboots, prequels etc....

I love all of the trilogies for different reasons and consider X2 and Spider-Man 2 to be in my top five comic book films of all time. The three trilogies all followed the same pattern.  If you look at the averaged Rotten Tomatoes critical ratings for the three trilogies the first films started strong (74.6), the sequels got better (78.6), and the third films went totally bonkers (48.6).

They all went off the rails for different reasons and because of this the third films have really weird and fun personalities. Whether it be Peter Parker going emo or a terrible attack on Alcatraz the movies are enjoyably bad. I appreciate that big budget blockbusters can go so wrong. "
9,"Between The Revenant, Carol, The Hateful Eight and Slow West 2015 was a banner year for fur coats 2015 had some [pretty incredible and practical fur coats] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/02/19/the-top-five-fur-coats-of-2015/). Here is how I would rank them.

1. Ben Mendelsohn - Slow West - I feel like the fur coat just grew around him. 

2. Cate Blanchett - Carol - She looks fabulous in her white-collar fur coat. 

3. Leonardo DiCaprio - The Revenant - The thing pretty much kept him alive. 

4. Kurt Russell - The Hateful Eight - On any other man the coat would totally engulf them. 

5. Jonathan Brugh - What We Do in the Shadows - Deacon looks like a rocker God in the fur coat. When and where did he get it? 

6. Chewbacca - Star Wars: The Force Awakens - This one is a stretch but he keeps his fur looking great. "
9,"Turbo Kid and Wyrmwood: Road of the Dead make for a perfect double feature. I love the DIY vibe, blood explosions and creativity exhibited. You can tell the creators have a genuine love of cinema. Both [Turbo Kid] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/02/16/turbo-kid-2015-a-weird-gory-goofy-quirky-post-apocalyptic-wasteland-b-action-movie/) and [Wyrmwood] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2015/08/25/wyrmwood-road-of-the-dead-an-australian-zombie-film-that-is-exploding-with-gore-and-creativity/) are on Netflix and I totally recommend you check them out. I love the small vibe and the way they tell post-apocalyptic stories on a budget. You can tell the creators have a love of cinema because they worked their asses off to make their own films that are actually really good. You will have fun watching them."
9,"What reactive or knockoff films have been good? I'm asking because it looks like Deadpool is going to influence studios like Pulp Fiction, Die Hard and Scream did. A movie hits big and makes a ton of money. The studios start pushing out similar films quickly (think I Know What You Did Summer for Scream). Which reactive movies have been good? "
9,"I am 94.237% certain this selection of Romantic(ish) films will help you pick a movie to watch on Valentine's Day The world is inundated with lists telling you which romantic films to watch on Valentine’s Day. I’m sure they all have their merits but they aren’t looking out for everybody. I wanted to bring you a wide variety of films in order to give you options. I understand that not everybody watches the same kind of movies so options are always nice. [I wrote the same type of post for Halloween and people seemed to like it so I decided to do another one] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3qkdj3/i_am_93456_certain_this_selection_of_horror_films/)

The following discussion features 10 categories and in those categories I’ve given you a main option and a backup in case you don’t like the first recommendation. Hopefully you can find something you will enjoy. There are 1,000’s of romantic films but I wanted to pick the films that ended on an optimistic mood (for the most part). You don’t want to end your night on a depressing (but really well done) moment.

**If you are in the mood for…..**


**A fantastic romance featuring one of the best performances of recent memory**

*Love & Basketball* tells a great romantic story and features one of my favorite performances. Sanaa Lathan is amazing in the movie and you totally buy her as a love interest and successful athlete. It is well worth a watch and I guarantee you will be swept up in the love story.

If you aren’t interested: You should check out *Bull Durham*. It is one of the great romantic sports movies and you can’t go wrong with Susan Surandon and Kevin Costner’s chemistry


**An amazing film full of great music and friendship**

*Once* is one of my favorite films and it tells a great story about friendship, love and growing up. It is impossible to not have a smile on your face after watching Once. Also, you will immediately fall in love with the song Falling Slowly. 

If you aren’t interested: Cameron Crowe hit all the right notes with *Almost Famous* and I don’t see how anyone wouldn’t be into the fun story and characters.

If you really aren’t interested: *Beyond the Lights* has a solid central romance and Gina Prince-Bythewood also directed *Love & Basketball.*


**A movie about a hockey player falling in love**

[Goon] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2015/07/08/movies-i-love-five-things-that-make-goon-an-amazing-film/) is not a romantic film but it features one of my favorite cinematic couples. I love Sean William Scott and Allison Pill and when she says “you make me want to stop sleeping with a bunch of guys” you will start clapping.

If you aren’t interested: If you are into unconventional love stories you need to watch *Punch Drunk Love*. Paul Thomas Anderson is brilliant and Adam Sandler has never been better.


**A beautiful tale of a father and son finding their way in new relationships**

I love *Beginners* because it does something different in the romance genre. It tells the story of people who finally make a massive decision that will change their lives. However, their beginning comes when they finally hunker down accept who they are or if they should stay in the relationship when things get hard.

If you aren’t interested: Check out *Amelie* because it might be one of the most charming movies you will ever watch. Audrey Tautou is a likable presence and you will be swept up on the whimsy of this French charmer.


**A woman being dragged to hell**

*Drag Me To Hell* is the first film my wife and I watched together…….and we are still together. It is a fantastic horror comedy that will have you laughing, cringing and loving life. It deserves its spot as [one of the best 21st century horror films] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2015/08/18/mff-reader-poll-the-top-21-horror-films-of-the-21st-century/)

If you aren’t interested: I never thought *Warm Bodies* would work. However, *Warm Bodies* is a nice little thing that has a sense of humor and a fun story.


**A sensitive dude and his boombox**

*Say Anything’s* Lloyd Dobler and Diane Court are the greatest cinematic couple of all time. I love that Lloyd is a [nice dude who can beat people up] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/01/12/the-11-nicest-cinematic-characters-who-can-also-beat-you-up/) and still be sensitive. Diane Court is wonderful too.

If you aren’t interested: I’m gonna stay with John Cusack and recommend *Serendipity*. It is a nice little charmer that features Cusack at his romantic comedy best.

**Two people walking and talking**

*[Before Sunrise] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2015/03/23/before-sunrise-the-best-romance-of-1995/)* is the beginning of a beautiful trilogy of films. It is optimistic, well-written and beautifully acted. My wife and I love this film.

If you aren’t interested: I’m going to stick with the travel idea and recommend *Lost in Translation.* It is a beautiful film with a great ending.


**An insane couple falling in love**

*True Romance* is a bonkers love story that is full of ultra violence and deplorable acts. It is a true cult classic that features fantastic chemistry between Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. You will love this crazy couple.

If you aren’t interested: This couple is totally different but you need to watch *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.* Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are terrible for each other but the movie is amazing. It is also the [highest rated critical/audience rated comedy/romance of the 21st century] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/01/07/comedies/)


**Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney at their best**

*Out of Sight* turns up the smolder to 11 and features Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney at their best. *Out of Sight* is effortless, sexy and cool.

If you aren’t interested: Brad Pitt and Angeline Jolie have crazy chemistry in *Mr. and Mrs. Smith.* 


**An absolute classic that never ages**

*Casablanca* is an ageless wonder that defies what a romance should be. It transcends genres and has totally earned its spots on AFI’s 100 passions list.

If you aren't interested: I gotta go with *Roman Holiday.* It is a classic for a reason.

Between Ex-Machina, Love & Mercy, Hateful Eight, Creed, Sicario, Spy, What We Do in the Shadows, Bone Tomahawk, Beasts of No Nation, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl and Bridge of Spies there were solid supporting turns. My favorite 2015 performances are:

1. Sam Jackson - Kingsman/Hateful Eight

2. Richard Jenkins - Bone Tomahawk

3. Mark Rylance - Bridge of Spies

4. Alicia Vikander - Ex-Machina

9,"Random Cinematic Observation. There are several parallels between Kate & Leopold and Hugh Jackman's career as Wolverine This is going to sound very random but there are [five aspects of Kate & Leopold] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2016/02/11/mff-random-observation-kate-and-leopold-foreshadowed-hugh-jackmans-career-as-wolverine/) that featured heavily in Hugh Jackman's career. 

1. Hugh Jackman is related to Leiv Schreiber in Kate & Leopold and X-Men Origins: Wolverine (cue dramatic music)

2. James Mangold directed Kate & Leopold and The Wolverine.

3. Both Leopold and Wolverine (Days of Future Past) time travel.

These are random but cover the movies Butter and Eddie the Eagle.

4. Leopold refuses to peddle ""bond scum butter"" in K&L and in 2013 played a butter sculptor in the movie Butter (mind blown)

5. Much like his K&L costar Meg Ryan, Jackman has faked an orgasm on screen. In the Eddie the Eagle one of Jackman's coaches techniques is teaching Eddie to release during the jump. So, naturally he fakes an orgasm to prove the point. I wonder if he got tips from Ryan. "
9,"What are your favorite 21st century creature features? I gotta go with Trollhunter, Rogue, Grabbers and Attack the Block. I love a good creature feature. When done right they are rewatchable (think Tremors) and lots of fun. I would recommend. 

1. Trollhunter - A brilliant found footage film about a guy who hunts trolls. It is a lot of fun and really well made. 

2. Grabbers - Drunk Irish villagers battle aliens. I love it. 

3. Attack the Block - A smart creature feature with likable characters.

4. Willow Creek - A bigfoot found footage movie that has a killer 20-minute single shot. 

5. [Dog Soldiers] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2014/10/20/dog-soldiers-neil-marshalls-werewolf-epic-of-awesomeness/) - Director Neil Marshall is my hero and Dog Soldiers is a great werewolf film. 

6. [Rogue] (http://moviesfilmsandflix.com/2014/08/26/underappreciated-cinema-the-fun-and-economical-rogue/) - An Australian crocodile film that is very underrated. "
9,"Bloody Sunday (2002) is a brilliant film. The hyper realism, respectful direction and solid performances make for a gut-wrenching and powerful experience. It makes for a solid double header with '71. I love [Bloody Sunday] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280491/). It is my favorite Paul Greengrass film and I think James Nesbitt gives one of the best 21st century performances. It is tough to watch but a very rewarding experience. 

I recently watched ['71] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2614684/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) and I think it gives a solid fictional look at the British perspective. I like seeing both sides of a conflict and appreciate both films"
9,"What movies do you watch whenever they are on cable/HBO? I've been watching Mad Max a lot lately and I have a feeling that whenever it is on cable in the future I will watch it as background. What movies are perfect background noise for you?

1. The Replacements 
2. Evolution
3. Hot Fuzz

10,"Pleasantville (1998) A subversive satire that becomes more relevant every day. Gary Ross's *Pleasantville* is a fantasy film about two siblings - Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon  - who find themselves trapped in the black-and-white 1950s sitcom, but as time passes the two expose the residents of Pleasantville to new experiences which brings color to the town as sort of awakening happens.  Unfortunately, many of the townsfolk resent these changes and persecute the ""colored people"" and with that tensions mount. 

This is a powerful film, with some great performances - especially from Joan Allen and Jeff Daniels - but it's the themes of ignorance, political oppression and white nationalism that makes *Pleasantville* an even more relevant film than when it was released back in the late 90s. 

If you haven't seen this film it is well worth checking out."
10,"Shadow (2018) A stark Wuxia-Shakespearean epic.  Co-writer and director Zhang Yimou, who gave us the wuxia epics *Hero* and *House of Flying Daggers*, brings forth another stylistic masterpiece.  *Shadow* deals with two rival kingdoms who each desire possession of the key city of Jing.  The plot to this movie involves doubles, a lot of backstabbing, scheming, assassinations and the most amazing use of umbrellas ever put to film.  I can't say anymore without possibly ruining the experience for a viewer of this truly amazing movie.

Note: The film is nearly all back and white, just skin tone and blood splashing colour into the mix, and watching the 4K disc on an Oled television was simply breathtaking. This movie is a must-see."
10,"In space, cryosleep will most likely kill you. I recently re-watched Stanley Kubrick's *2001: A Space Odyssey* and when Hal the ship's a.i. killed the three scientists in hibernation it got me thinking of other science fiction films that have had characters killed off while in cryosleep.

* Planet of the Apes (1968) The one female crewmember dies in her sleep when her pod is cracked.

* Alien 3 (1992) Hicks and New don’t survive their crash landing.

* Pitch Black (2000) Debris from a passing comet ruptures the ship’s hull, the crash kills most of the hibernating crew and passengers.

* Supernova (2000) The captain is killed by micrometeorites.

Any other examples of this science fiction trope?"
10,"Disney's Neverending Live-Action Remakes, Opinions? Back in 2010 Tim Burton's *Alice in Wonderland* made over a billion dollars which sent a clear signal to Disney that they had treasure in them there vaults.  His film may not have been the first live-action Disney remake - that would have been the 1994's *Jungle Book* - but Burton's film is definitely responsible for the current onslaught. 

I've been less than pleased with the majority of these live-action ""re-imagining"" - I'd maybe give a couple of them a passing grade - and they mostly come across as soulless cash grabs.  For me, the worst offender comes from Tim Burton himself whose [Dumbo](http://manapop.com/film/dumbo-2019-review/) took a short and sweet magical story and turned it into a loud overindulgent mess, where fantastic visuals superseded good storytelling, but worst of all is the fact that Dumbo became a secondary character in his own bloody movie.

What are your feelings on the past and future Disney live-action remakes?  Are there titles you are really looking forward to?"
10,"Favorite Movie Dance Number. Nothing can bring a smile to my face faster than a great movie dance number,  there is just something about the joy of dance that is just so infectious.

Some of my favorites:

* Grease: School Dance [Born to Hand Jive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5pmzmiDO8)

10,"Who remembers the Kenner Movie Viewer? Back in the 70s, when VCRs were going for about $1,300 dollars - that's about $8,600 bucks in today's dollars - there was a Kenner toy called [The Movie Viewer](https://imgur.com/gallery/gHnwkx2) which allowed kids to view moments from their favorite movies or television shows.  Sure, it was only about sixty seconds of footage and had no sound but you were able to see moments from Star Wars while it was still in the theaters. 

They worked simply by hand-cranking the viewer, just like an old-time movie camera, and you could even play the film backward, which gave you a look into how some of the jumping stunts in *The Six Million Dollar Man* were actually filmed.  I had this toy when I was a kid and goddamn but was it the coolest thing."
10,"Top Incarnations of Death in the Movies. The visage of the Grim Reaper has appeared in many forms across multiple mediums for ages, from Charles Dickens' *A Christmas Carol* to Terry Pratchett's *Discworld* series in literature - which have also been adapted multiple times - but what are your favorite incarnations of Death in the movies?

* The Seventh Seal (1957) This Ingmar Bergman film gave us the famous chess scene where Max Von Sydow faces off against Death.

* Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey (1991) In a loving and funny homage to Bergman's classic this movie finds our bumbling heroes not only defeating Death (William Sadler) but also teaming up with him.

* Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt 1 (2010) This installment of the massively popular series gave us a beautifully animated sequence about three brothers cheating Death.

*  Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (1983)  Don't eat the Salmon Mousse. 

* The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988) This winged Angel of Death was a wonderfully dark figure in the Terry Gilliam fantasy.

* The Masque of the Red Death (1964) Death is the ultimate party crasher in this Roger Corman/Vincent Price horror classic. 

Now my favorite incarnation of Death is the one portrayed by Frederic March in the 1934 film [Death Takes a Holiday](http://manapop.com/film/death-takes-a-holiday-1934-review/) where Death takes the form of a mortal, to experience life so that he can better relate to humans, but he didn't plan on falling in love.  This is one of my all-time favorite love stories - which most recently was remade as ""Meet Joe Black* with Brad Pitt - but for me, nothing touches the original '30s classic.

What is your favorite version of the Grim Reaper?"
10,"M. Night Shyamalan’s “Glass” or “How Not to Write a Twist” *SPOILERS* *Glass* is the follow up film that ties M. Night Shyamalan’s superhero film *Unbreakable* with his supernatural thriller *Split*, and deals with superhuman vigilante David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and malignant psychopathic Kevin Wendell Crumb aka “The Horde” being captured and brought to an institution for the criminally insane by Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) under the auspices of her study on people with the delusion of being superheroes. Also locked up in this hospital is evil master mind Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), and the film spends much of its two hour plus running time with Dr. Staple trying to convince these three that they aren’t special, but being the fact that David’s power are empirically easy to prove exists this comes across as utter bullshit…unless of course Dr. Staple has some secret agenda.

The Stupidity that is “Glass”   *Spoilers*

* David is locked in a cell that can be pumped full of water – his one weakness – but if Staple is trying to prove David is normal putting him in a “kryptonite” cell isn’t a smart move, because if he was just an average dude a regular cell would hold him just fine.

* Dr. Staple has a group therapy session with our three leads, where she tries to chip away at the belief they are superhuman – pointing out that “The Beast” could have bent bars because they were old and weak, and survived a shotgun blast for the same reason – but she never gets around to explaining away how David is virtually unbreakable and super strong.

* Elijah is given pretty much free reign in this psyche ward due to the fact that they apparently only keep one guard on duty at a time, and if one is late showing up for work the other one fucks off anyway.

* Video footage is only checked on when it’s helpful to the plot, and Elijah is able to delete all his wanderings without anyone noticing jumps in time code.  He’s apparently just that good or everyone else is just that bad at their jobs.

* Dr. Staple plans to use a laser surgery on Elijah’s brain to lobotomize him, but unbeknownst to her on one of his nightly forays he’d stolen the lenses out of the laser, and thus after the surgery is “performed” he is returned to his room unchanged.  Question:  How in the fuck can you perform a lobotomy with a broken laser and not notice?  Is there some kind of magical lasers that can access the brain without actually cutting through flesh?  Or is Dr. Staple just an idiot for not seeing that her operation is actually happening?

* Elijah informs David of their plans to attack and destroy a chemical company, but David actually is starting to wonder of Dr. Staple is right, and his powers are all in his mind, which once again this is ridiculous because he has quantifiable super powers.

* Elijah and The Beast are able to walk through hospital checkpoints simply because they have a stolen key card, and somehow none of the guards recognize two of the most notorious killers to ever walk the streets of this fair city.

* It’s revealed that Dr. Staple works for a clandestine society that has been covering up the existence of super humans for centuries, and if she could convince these three that they aren’t special they’d be left alone, but if she fails they will be executed. This is apparently to protect humanity from the fights that would stem from superheroes and supervillains popping up, and by god there has to be a more efficient way of handling this situation.

* Staples primary mission is to keep the world in the dark about people with super powers, yet she installs dozens of extra cameras to keep an eye on the ever slippery Elijah, which just plays into his hands as he was able to hack the system and stream the superhero fight to an offsite server, but if your goal is secrecy maybe have less cameras and more guards on hand – ones who work for the secret society and not the idiots we see employed by this hospital.

It’s clear that M. Night Shyamalan had this big idea about superhero mythology - this idea does have merit and could have led to an interesting movie - but the moronic actions and statements by Dr. Staple made it pretty obvious early on that she must have some secret agenda, because her “People with delusions” theory wouldn’t hold up for ten seconds when put to David Dunn, who could just ask an orderly to stab in the leg with a pen to prove he’s unbreakable.  The amount of hoop jumping Shyamalan had to write into this script to make this twist work is simply inexcusable, and is basically an example of a screenwriter trying to ram a round peg in a square hole."
10,"In the film Highlander why does Ramirez mentor Connor MacLeod? We learn from Ramirez that he and Connor belong to a group of immortals, who can be killed only by decapitation. When one immortal decapitates another, the winner receives a transfer of power from the deceased called ""The Quickening.""  These immortals will do battle until there is only one left alive and the survivor will receive ""The Prize"" which enables its winner to gain unlimited knowledge of the universe.

So why would one immortal want to help improve the swordsmanship of someone who could end up being an opponent for the prize?  Ramirez does state that it is very important that the Kurgan doesn't win, as this would send the world into an eternal dark age, so having all ""good guy"" immortals being up to snuff is kind of important, but it still could lead to teacher facing off against pupil.

And if the Kurgan had been killed earlier what would have happened if it came down to Sean Connery and Christopher Lambert being the last two?"
10,"What is your favorite movie Medusa? I recently re-watched the Ray Harryhausen [Clash of the Titans](http://manapop.com/film/clash-of-the-titans-1981-from-myth-to-movie/) and it got me thinking how we don't have enough movies based on Greek mythology - you could even do *Game of Thones* length series based on Homer's epic of Odysseus alone - but it's the amount of cool monsters that populate the Greek myths that always intrigued me, with the tragic character of Medusa being my favorite.  Every movie depicts her simply as an evil monster, leaving out her backstory where she was turned into said creature by the  goddess Athena, who found out about Medusa's affair with Poseidon.  So I'd love to see a movie that dealt with such interesting and complicated monsters.

But going with what we've seen so for what cinematic Medusa is your favorite?

[Medusa](https://i1.wp.com/manapop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/vlcsnap-2017-01-28-18h13m31s229.png) from the 1981 *Clash of the Titans*.

[Medusa](https://i0.wp.com/manapop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/vlcsnap-2017-02-20-09h22m36s887.png) from the 2010 *Clash of the Titans*.

10,"Is remaking a comedy about the most pointless endeavor? Remakes have been a thing from almost the very beginning of cinema, we've had a couple remakes of *Ben Hur* and John Carpenter's *The Thing* is considered by many to be superior to the original, but when it comes to making a comedy...what can be improved?

I just saw the trailer for [The Hustle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of52MNnXoxU) which is a remake of the Steve Martin/Michael Caine comedy *Dirty Rotten Scoundrels*, and not only does it look just terrible but I just don't see the point behind it?"
10,"The Highwaymen (2019) An excellent depiction of the hunt for Bonnie and Clyde. This film deals with the two ex-Texas Rangers who were brought out of ""retirement"" to hunt down the notorious outlaws Bonnie and Clyde.  Unlike the Warren Beatty/Fay Dunaway film from the 60s this depiction does not romanticize the duo - though it does deal with how popular they were at the time, even to the point of starting fashion trends - as director John Lee Hancock's clearly shows these two as being the cold blooded murderers and cop killers they were.  Kevin and Costner and Woody Harrelson play ex-Rangers Frank Hamer and Maney Gault, and the two are case of perfect casting.  Director John Lee Hancock brings to life a time when law enforcement was going through some big changes as well as how society could glorify such terrible people.

This is movie would make for an interesting double bill with the Arthur Penn version."
10,"Movie Titles That Completely Lied. Just finished watching the 1959 RKO production of *From the Earth to the Moon* - which is a very loose adaptation of the Jules Verne story - but apparently due to RKO preparing to shut down much of the budget was slashed, and thus the film hasn't a single scene of people on the Moon.

Any other films out there with blatantly wrong or misleading titles?"
10,"Smallfoot (2018) Science vs Religion I just watched the Warner Bros animated film *Smallfoot*, and was pleasantly amazed at the film's subject matter, which deals with a group of people - in this case Yetis - who have been fed a religious doctrine and told not to question it, but a small group of them believe that maybe the ""Stones"" are necessarily right, and that there may be more to life.

That religious groups didn't protest this film - which basically states religion is based on fear and ignorance - in what is ostensibly a family film, is quite surprising.  Kudos to the studio for releasing an animated film with an actual message and theme, other than just a collection of poop jokes and prat falls.

You want a good movie for your kids to check out, this one I highly recommend."
10,"Mads Mikkelsen Recommendation Thread. Mads Mikkelsen first caught my attention when he played Le Chiffre in the Bond flick *Casino Royal*, and since then I've always been impressed at just how damn good he is, from big parts to small parts, he is the consummate character actor.  

So here are few of his films that if you haven't seen you really need to check out.

* Flame & Citron (2008) Mads plays one of the two Danish resistance movement fighters nicknamed Flammen and Citron, during the Nazi occupation of Denmark in World War II. 

* Valhalla Rising (2009) Mads plays a Norse warrior named One-Eye, who travels with a band of Christian Crusaders by ship in the hopes of finding the Holy Land.  They don't quite make it to the Holy Land, and things do not go well for the Crusaders.

* The Door (2009) Mads plays an artist whose daughter drowns because he was off fucking the neighbor, instead of watching her by the pool, but five years later he finds a mysterious door that leads into the past, the only problem is dealing with the version of him that currently lives there.

* The Hunt (2012) Mads plays a Danish preschool teacher who is wrongfully accused of sexually abusing the children, the film deals brilliantly with how such an accusation can ruin ones life.

* Age of Uprising: The Legend of Michael Kohlhaas (2013)  Mads plays a 16th century, horse dealer who leads a revolt against a crooked Baron, whose actions resulted in the death of the horse dealer's wife.

* The Salvation (2014) Mads plays a peaceful American settler who avenges the death of his family, standing against a town that betrayed him, and the notorious gang leader who all of the townsfolk fear.

* Polar (2019) Mads plays an assassin who is planning on retiring, but his employer isn't too eager to cough up the $8 million dollar pension payment, so a team of young assassins is sent out to kill him.  Things do not go well for these assassins.

And of course if you haven't seen him in the television series Hannibal (2013-2015) his performance as Dr. Hannibal Lecter is simply chilling."
10,"The Airport Franchise: From good to laughable in four easy steps. The 70s were the golden age of the disaster films, with such classics as *The Towering Inferno* and *The Poseidon Adventure*, but the crown jewel of Universal Studios was the Airport franchise.  Based on Arthur Hailey’s popular novel *Airport* this series of films went from 1970 to 1979, began with Box Office Gold until ending with Box Office poison, and would eventually inspire the classic Abrams and Zucker Brothers spoof *Airplane!*  Recently I went back and gave these movies another look.


[Airport (1970)]( http://manapop.com/film/airport-1970-review/): A mad bomber adds complications to the running of a Chicago airport as a snowstorm while Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin’s marital infidelities keeps everyone on their toes.

[Airport 1975]( http://manapop.com/film/airport-1975-review/): A small plane collides with Boeing 747, taking out the entire flight crew, leaving stewardess Karen Black to fly the plane, but Charleton Heston is in the wings to save the day.

[Airport ‘77]( http://manapop.com/film/airport-77-review/): A hijacked Boeing 747 plunges into the depths of the Bermuda Triangle, trapping the passengers in its deadly embrace.  Can Jack Lemon and Christopher Lee save the day?

[The Concorde...Airport ’79]( http://manapop.com/film/the-concorde-airport-79-review/): Evil weapons manufacturer Robert Wagner goes to great lengths to bring down the Concorde, his girlfriend being on board with incriminating evidence against him, so it’s up to George Kennedy to dodge killer drones and fighter jets to bring the passengers to safety.

10,"Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993) Working my way through the Bluray collection of ""Batman: The Animated"" and finally reached the two Batman animated films that are included in this set, and I had forgotten just how good they were.

Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (1993)  Taking elements from both ""Batman: Year One"" and ""Batman: Year Two"" we get a story that explores the character of Bruce Wayne in a way that had never been done before, where we see him actually beg his dead parents if he can give up on his vow of vengeance because he'd fallen in love, ""*Please! I need it to be different now. I know I made a promise, but I didn't see this coming. I didn't count on being happy.""*

Then we have the title character of the Phantasm, who is running around Gotham knocking of mobsters, and because of the Phantasm's costume being very cape-centric Batman gets the blame, and so the Dark Knight has to deal with the cops hunting him as well as this new villain.

And of course Mark Hamil returns to provide the voice of The Joker, and because this movie was theatrical released it wasn't held to the ""No one can die"" rule of the Network's Broadcast and Standards laws, and so we do get to see people actually getting offed.

If you haven't seen *Batman: Mask of the Phantasm* do yourself a favor and track it down, it's simply one of the best Batman movies out there, animated or live action.

Side Note:  A friend of mind picked up the action figure of the Phantasm before seeing the movie, and when he took the hood off the figure it revealed the Phantasm's secret identity.  The toy should have come with a Spoiler Alert.

10,"Movie Fights: Who would win - Munchkins or Oompa Loompas? Consider this in the manner of the Jets versus the Sharks only with goofier names and even goofier songs. Can the Munchkins, who buckled under the Wicked Witch of the West, stand up against Willy Wonka's lesson spouting minions?  Could the Lollipop Guild kick the orange-faced Oompa Loompas into a chocolatey grave?

Where would you place your money and why?"
10,"Prequels that attack the original film. If one were to list good movie prequels it most surely be a short list, and one of the key problems with prequels is that most of the information we learn was totally unnecessary, if not it would have been in the original.  Did we need to know how Han Solo won the Millennium Falcon?  Absolutely not, that stuff is fine for fan fiction but is really not needed, but what bothers me is when the prequel seems to go out of its way to undo characters we've grown to love.

* In the Star Wars prequels we learn that Darth Vader was once annoying child who grew up to be an even whiny teen, one who eventually murders a bunch of kids, a moment that pretty much makes Vader's redemption in Jedi awful.  I'm sure if Luke knew his dad didn't just sit back and watch his boss blow up planets, but also personally murdered children, he may have thought twice about the whole, ""*I know there is good inside you.""*

* Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom gives us a prequel where we learn that Indy was a bit of a dick, he's all about fortune and glory - with an emphasis on fortune as we first see him as sell a precious artifact for jewels - but worse is the fact that in this movie he sees actually magic.  In Raiders he admonishes Brody for being worried about hunting for the Ark of the Covenant, *""What are you trying to do, scare me? You sound like my mother. We've known each other for a long time. I don't believe in magic, a lot of superstitious hocus pocus""* and that is a strange attitude from a I guy who just a year ago saw Mola Ram pull a burning heart out of a guys chest.

What are some other good examples of prequels screwing around the characters and story points, and that seem to be working against what we saw in the original?"
10,"""Technology is Dangerous"" I just watched the new sci-fi action film **Upgrade** and it got me thinking of movies where technology led to bad things happening.  

With advances in computer/human interactions reaching levels that surpass even what we saw on shows like **The Jetsons**, with Siri and Alexa invading millions of lives, it’s not surprising that we are going to get more “fear of technology” themed movies. In 1968 Stanley Kubrick’s **2001: A Space Odyssey** gave us the chilling HAL 9000 computer, which showed us that machines are not to be trusted, and theme has continued on – Mother from Ridley Scott’s **Alien**, the machines from **The Matrix**, to updated versions of **Battlestar Galactica** and **Westworld** – all illustrating that if mankind isn’t too careful it could see itself in big trouble.

What are some other good movies where technology bites humanity in the ass?"
10,"Failed Franchises. With the popularity of the Harry Potter books and the Twilight series a successful movie series was almost a given - with such a built in audience you'd have to work hard to screw it up - but for every successful franchise made there's another one that died on the vine.

In 2014 Universal Pictures released [The Seventh Son](http://manapop.com/film/seventh-son-2014-review/) - loosely based on the book *""The Spook's Apprentice""* - and it's obvious the studio was hoping to have Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings franchise on their hands, but the filmmakers so mismanaged the property that the film now is almost forgotten.

What other films out there were hopeful franchise starters that failed to get out of the gate?"
10,"What are some good game to movie adaptations? It's no secret that most video game adaptations suck - even the successful **Tomb Raider** and **Resident Evil** movies one would be hard pressed to call them ""good"" films, and then you have the **Hitman** films which are just bottom of the barrel bad.

One of my favorite game to movie adaptations isn't based on a video game but a board game, and that would be the comedy classic [Clue](http://manapop.com/film/clue-1985-review/), which starred such comic legends as Tim Curry, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean and Madeline Kahn.  Maybe it had a leg up over later video game adaptions by not having any kind of plot to adapt, it just had the basic premise of a murder mystery.

So what game to movie adaptations would you recommend?"
10,"Movies that had a lot going for them but still failed. Making movies is hard - anyone telling you different is a liar - and even if you have the perfect ingredients to make a ""sure fire hit"" there is a still a good chance your film will not turn out they you'd hoped.

In 1979 Disney released their sci-fi adventure film [The Black Hole](http://manapop.com/film/the-black-hole-1979-review/) - a blending of Kubrick's **2001: A Space Odyssey** with Shakespeare’s The Tempest - but despite being a high concept space adventure, and following just two years after **Star Wars** was released, the film vastly under performed.  The film had a fantastic cast, with the likes of Robert Forster and Maximillian Schell, it had great matte painting by effects artist Peter Ellenshow, and a score by the legendary John Barry, but somehow none of it gelled together.

What others films should have turned out better than they did?"
10,"Return of the Living Dead: Part II (1988) A failure of balance. I just watched the Scream Factory special edition for **Return of the Living Dead: Part II (1988)** and I must say it's rare to have interviews with cast and crew members where 80% of the responses fall into ""*The film basically sucked*"" category.  It even has guys from the original film bashing it - one even mentions telling the studio that ""*This script sucks, and if you use any of my zombie designs I will sue.*""

It really comes down to writer/director Ken Wiederhorn deciding that he couldn't walk the horror/comedy line as well as Dan O'Bannon did, so he went ahead and made a film that was strictly a comedy, with as much slapstick farce as possible.  Not helped by the fact that according to many - cast and crew alike - they never found Wiederhorn to be all that engaged in the movie, or even a fan of the horror genre at all.

The end result was some well made zombie gags - Kenny Myers the make-up guy returning from the first film - but nothing really else worth praising, as the movie itself was just so annoying, with pretty much every character being a complete an utter moron, to the point you want them all to die as soon as possible.

This is a case of the ""Making of Features"" on the Bluray being vastly more entertaining than the movie itself."
10,"Are the Oscars turning into the MTV Movie Awards? With the Oscars adding a category for ""Most Popular Film"" isn't that just one step away from throwing in ""Best Kiss"" and ""Best Scene Stealer"" awards?

The Oscars are voted on by people in the Academy, from those that work in that particular field - ie actors, directors, editors - so having a ""Most Popular"" category is more in the line of The Peoples Choice Awards or MTV Movie Awards, and has nothing to do with The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences."
10,"Movies About the Film Industry. Hollywood loves to celebrate itself - with such great film's as George Curkor's **A Star is Born** and Robert Altman's **The Player** - but not all are that great, or that memorable, so what are some movies about the Hollywood machine that though not amazing are still worth checking out?

Example:  [Hooper (1978)](http://manapop.com/film/hooper-1978-review/) - Starring Burt Reynolds, and directed by former stuntman Hal Needham, this was basically a love letter to stuntmen in Hollywood.  It wasn't necessarily an accurate portrayal of the stunt industry, but it was still a fun movie.

So what are your favorite movies about movie making can you recommend? "
10,"Films that are Shameless Rip-offs. If something is a big hit it’s no surprise that other people will jump on the bandwagon – the amount of **Star Wars** rip-offs that followed **A New Hope** was staggering – but what about those filmmakers who went a bit too far in stealing from another’s success.

I recently watched the 1962 fantasy adventure film [Jack the Giant Killer]( http://manapop.com/film/jack-the-giant-killer-1962-review/) which had a staggering amount of elements that were whole-heartedly stolen from Ray Harryhausen’s 1958 film **The 7th Voyage of Sinbad**.  Not only did **Jack the Giant Killer** lift monster designs and plot points from Harryhausen’s film but producer Edward Small not only hired the same director of that film but he also cast Kerwin Mathews as Jack – who played Sinbad in Harryhausen’s movie – and Torin Hatcher as the evil sorcerer – who also played the evil sorcerer in **The 7th Voyage of Sinbad.**

10,"Favorite depiction of Atlantis. The lost city of Atlantis has appeared in dozens of movies - not to mention a bunch of television shows - and the ""mystery"" behind this mythical civilization continues to spark the imagination of filmmakers.  One of the better depictions would have to be the Disney animated feature **Atlantis: The Lost Empire** - its Mike Mignola inspired designs are fantastic, but I will always have a soft spot for George Pal's [Atlantis, The Lost Continent](http://manapop.com/film/atlantis-the-lost-continent-1961-review/) with its goofy hodge-podge of sets and props from dozens of other movies, plus it has a cool crystal-laser weapon and awesome Island of Doctor Moreau lab.

So what's your favorite version of Atlantis?"
10,"Coma (1978) Michael Crichton directed this medical thriller about a Boston hospital secretly putting people into comas so that they can harvest and sell the organs on the black market.  Geneviève Bujold plays a resident surgeon who uncovers the plot - despite her doctor boyfriend (Michael Douglas) declaring her paranoid - and while trying to prove the conspiracy she finds herself pursued by a killer.

This is one of those taught 70s thrillers that doesn't quite hold up over time, Geneviève Bujold's weepy doctor makes incredibily stupid decisions throughout the film.

* She discovers the hidden pipe that pumps carbon monoxide that leads to OR 8 - which is what causes the patients to go into a coma - but she doesn't notify the authorities.

* She locks the armed killer in a cold storage room but once again she doesn't call the police, instead she runs to her boyfriend's house to fall hysterically into his arms.

* After discovering the facility that harvest the organs she escapes - avoiding dogs and idiot security guards - and again she doesn't got to the police but instead informs the hospitals Chief of Surgery (Richard Widmark) of what she has uncovered.  So she believes there is this massive conspiracy in her hospital and her first thought is to run to the guy in charge?

I haven't read the Robin Cooke book the movie is based on - it could be more plausible and the heroine less idiotic - but I found the film to be very frustrating.  The real highlight was seeing early career moments of Ed Harris, Rip Torn, and Tom Selleck."
10,"Great Movies with Glaring Plot Holes. Even the best movies are going to have some mistakes - even films like **Citizen Kane** and **Casablanca** are not exempt from this - but if the film is good enough we either don't notice the mistake or couldn't care less that it's there, because we love the movie.

Pixar's **Toy Story** is a fantastic film, not only did it change the animation industry it also had an amazing story to tell, but it also has a pretty big plot hole.  All the toys in Andy's room know their toys, they stop moving and ""play dead"" whenever a human is around, but Buzz Lightyear thinks he is a real space ranger - and not a toy - so why does he become still when humans approach?  The film establishes that toys can move if a human is around - they torture the hell out of Sid - so Buzz playing dead makes no sense.

What other glaring plot holes in otherwise good films do you know of?"
10,"Fifty Shades of Silly. The ""erotic novels"" by E. L. James earned the author around $100 million dollars - apparently there a lot of easily titillated soccer moms out there - so the books making their way to the big screen was no surprise.  Unfortunately the films are a little *too* faithful to the books - which are rather poorly written - but still managed to make big box office, proving that soccer moms like going to the theater as well.

[Fifty Shades of Grey](http://manapop.com/film/fifty-shades-of-grey-2015-review/): The first movie introduces us to Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) - a mild mannered college graduate - and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) who seduces the naive college grad into the world of BDSM.

[Fifty Shades Darker](http://manapop.com/film/fifty-shades-darker-2017-review/): In the second film we learn that Christian is damaged goods - which Ana somehow finds endearing - but we also meet Jack Hyde (Eric Johnson) - Ana's new boss and resident sexual predator - and Leila (Bella Heathcote) a past submissive partner of Christians who has since turned stalker.

[Fifty Shades Freed](http://manapop.com/film/fifty-shades-freed-2018-review/): In the final chapter we find Ana and Christian married - still practicing the lamest version of BDSM - where our two protagonist must now deal with Jack Hyde's crazy plans to kidnap Ana while also putting up with Christian's petulant attitude towards having children.

The series overall is pretty ridiculous - we have a heroine who has just graduated from but doesn't have an email address or knows what a butt plug - and a love interest who veers between being an emotional cripple and a complete dickhead. The terrible writing - which is sadly too faithful to the books - isn't helped by the complete lack of chemistry between Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan.  The film is also guilty of showing the BDSM lifestyle in a rather poor light - with Ana being a naive doormat and Christian a billionaire bully - and the film's ""kinky"" moments are rather cringe worthy at times."
10,"Movies that fail to stick the landing. One of the most disappointing things to me in a film is when a movie has a good premise - chugs along at a good pace - but then when it comes to end it drops the ball.  It's almost worse than a film that is bad throughout as you feel more let down.

I recently watched the Nicholas Cage/Selma Blair film [Mom and Dad](http://manapop.com/film/mom-and-dad-2017-review/) - which is about the parental extinct to protect one's child being turned on it's head - and the movie had some interesting things to say, but then when it came to end...well it just didn't.  I'm not saying you can't have a movie with an open ending - Hitchcock's **The Birds** a prime example of this type of ending - but the film still has to be satisfying, you can't leave your audience confused and frustrated.

What are some good examples of movies that dropped the ball on the ten yard line?"
10,"Worst Faked Locations. That movies are often not shot exactly where the story takes place - Toronto and Vancouver have stood in for New York City countless times - is certainly no industry secret, but usually the location is shot in such a way so the audience can't tell.  I recently watched [Tremors: A Cold Day in Hell](http://manapop.com/film/tremors-a-cold-day-in-hell-2018-review/) which tried to pass off South Africa for the Canadian Arctic - colorizing sand to pass for snow - and not once was it believable, not helped by characters claiming *""Arctic heatwave.""*

What other movies out there really fumbled on the faking of locations?"
10,"What are some good non Marvel or DC superhero movies? I recently watched the fun South Korean film [Psychokinesis](http://manapop.com/film/psychokinesis-2018-review/), where a lowly security guard gains super powers, and it got me wondering about superhero movies not based on characters created by the two comic book titans.  So what non Marvel or DC superhero movies out there are worth checking out?"
10,"Hour of the Gun (1967) With **Hour of the Gun** producer/director John Sturges gives us a more accurate portrayal of the events following the famous Gunfight at the OK Corral (an event the movie opens with and which the battle only last a few brutal seconds) and stars James Garner as Wyatt Earp and Jason Robards as the infamous Doc Holliday.

Though the film claims it is very accurate it still does a bit of Hollywood fudging but what it nails is how both Wyatt Earp and Ike Clanton (Robert Ryan) bent the law to serve their own needs - with Clanton trying to remove the annoying Earps who stood in his way by both ""legal"" ways and if that failed murder, and in Wyatt Earp using the law to get his revenge against Clanton and his men.

James Garner puts in a chilling performance as a man who coldly tracks down and basically forces his enemies to draw on him so that he is justified in gunning them down, even his best friend Doc Holliday calls him out on it stating. *""Those aren't warrants you have there... those are hunting licenses!*""  This is not one of those movies that glorifies the Old West but instead fairly accurately shows how life was cheap and the law often went to who had the most money.

If you haven't seen this western I highly recommend any fan of the genre to check it out, if only to see Garner stepping away from his affable fun loving character type to a more darker and complex role."
10,"Favorite singer turned actor role (for non singing roles) Last night I watched a documentary on David Bowie and it got me thinking of singers who tried to make the transition into movies and how so many of them fail and the very few that prove that succeed. 

One movie that has always impressed me is Tony Scott's [The Hunger](http://manapop.com/film/the-hunger-1983-review/) which is about an ancient vampire, played by Catherine Deneuve, who seduces a doctor who is an expert in the field of aging, played by Susan Sarandon.  It's a fantastic vampire movie but for me the standout performances was from David Bowie who plays Deneuve's former lover who finds himself, after years of being her vampire partner, suddenly aging.  If you haven't seen this movie it is well worth tracking down and checking out.

What other singers have made startling good transitions from being a singer to actor?"
10,"How an Avatar sequel would realistically play out. The 2009 smash hit **Avatar** ended with our heroes repelling the evil corporation, we see corporate stooge Parker Selfridge and his minions being marched into ships to be sent off planet, but what would be the next logical step for the RDA mining company?

If unobtanium is as valuable as they say that company would logically return with more fire power, and guess what, the Na'vi will have a hard time defeating a space based attack.  To quote Ellen Ripley from **Aliens**, *""I say we take off and nuke the site from orbit, it's the only way to be sure.""*

Flying dragons wouldn't be very effective against orbital bombardments which could easily devastate Pandora's hometrees so I'm not quite sure how James Cameron is going to write himself out of that corner.   If history tells us anything it's that if rich white people want something bad enough a bunch of natives with primitive weapons will not win out in the long run."
10,"Worst Abuse of Product Placement. Product placement is pretty much standard in big movies but sometimes it becomes *just* a little overt; for example the film **You've Got Mail** was basically a commercial for AOL but because that apparently was not enough money for the producers they also shameless shoved Starbucks and Visa in the viewers face whenever it could. 

What other movies blatantly used product placement above and beyond the norm?"
10,"When a twist fails. Today the term ""twist"" in movies is mostly associated with the works of M. Night Shyamalan but films have been doing shocking turn of events for quite some time, Alfred Hitchcock and his film **Psycho** provided one of the all time favorite classic twists, yet not all movie twists work.

I recently watched [The Eyes of Laura Mars](http://manapop.com/film/eyes-of-laura-mars-1978-review/) where Faye Dunaway plays a controversial fashion photographer who starts to see through the eyes of the killer, but not only does the film fail to provide a reason for this supernatural ""gift"" but the filmmakers throw in a big twist at the end that I'm betting was added just to cover up for the fact they couldn't come up with a proper ending.  The Twist in **The Eyes of Laura Mars** comes completely out of left field with no evidence provided to back it up, it wasn't even in the original script written by John Carpenter, and so the viewer is left thinking *""What the fuck?""* and not *""Oh my god!""*

What other films bungle their supposed big twist?"
10,"Message from the King (2016) This is a damn good revenge flick. Chadwick Boseman plays Jacob King, a South African man who arrives in Los Angeles after receiving a message from his estranged sister that she is in trouble.  Shortly upon arriving he discovers she has since been tortured to death and soon he is embroiled on a hunt for those responsible.

This is an excellent action/thriller/drama and Boseman is just captivating as the revenge fueled brother, but he's not alone as the film also gives us great performances by Alfred Molina as a movie producer/pedophile and Luke Evans as a Hollywood dentist who sidelines as a drug dealer/party planner for the rich and powerful.  It's a brutal movie and does not shy away from the violence.

I just caught this on Netflix and highly recommend it."
10,"Worst Horror Franchise. I recently watched [Hellraiser: Judgement](http://manapop.com/film/hellraiser-judgment-2018-review/), which is the tenth film in the Hellraiser franchise, and not only was it another lame and tired entry it was basically a blatant rip-off of David Fincher's **Se7en**.  Now with franchises like **Halloween** and **Friday the 13th** there have been many ups and downs but the in the case of the **Hellraiser** series it went direct-to-video after only three theatrically released movies and only the first two are notably quite good.

Can anyone think of another horror franchise with a worst track record than the **Hellraiser** series?"
10,"Honey We Shrank Matt Damon! I just watched **Downsizing** and it's hard to believe such an interesting premise could be so easily pissed away with one of the most lazy moralizing stories put to screen.  Matt Damon plays Joe Nobody a poor schlep not happy with his life so he abandons the world he knows for a hopefully better life in Tiny town, unfortunately his wife backs out at the last minute and he finds himself living alone in Legoland.  Lucky for him he bumps into your standard magic ethnic character who will show him what is important in life and maybe he ""grows"" a bit as a person. 

This is an insufferable movie that at over two hours is painful to watch at times and one that abandons the unique science fiction premise for cliched characters that fail to engage the viewer.

A few thoughts:

* With the downsizing of their assets Matt Damon and his wife would be millionaires in the Tiny Town economy but when his wife chickens out and sues for divorce we next see Matt Damon no longer living in his mansion but in a crappy little apartment.   Did Matt Damon's character have the worst divorce attorney in history?   

* If you can't downsize inorganic matter how can the little people have celphones and other electronics?  Miniaturization of circuit boards can only go so far.

* At one point we see our main characters sailing down a river in Norway and not once does the film address the fact that a miniature boat would be sunk by even the most tepid rain storm."
10,"Is ""Hurricane Heist"" just a remake of ""Hard Rain?"" Just watched the trailer for [Hurricane Heist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioW7yNwBkpc) and looks like the exact same premise as the 1998 heist film [Hard Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOPWoK-tpYU) starring Christian Slater.

Both films center around a bank heist during a natural disaster and aside from the newer one seeming to have a bigger budget they do look a little similar."
10,"Dancing on the Ceiling with Fred Astaire. Watching **Royal Wedding** on TCM and I must say that the [dancing on the ceiling sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsoYyDlYU8M) has to be one of the most amazing dance routines ever filmed.  The room is on a rotating gimbal but somehow Astaire makes the transitions from floor to wall to ceiling without giving away the method.

Fred Astaire was a genius on two feet.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0g3g6AvLtM) shows how it was done."
10,"Star Making Roles. Many a great actor can spend decades giving excellent performances after excellent performances and yet not achieve ""Star"" status because they never got that one role that would change everything.

By the 1970s Burt Reynolds had been a visible television star with a few movies under his belt but it was his portrayal of alpha male Lewis in **Deliverance** that catapulted him into stardom and for over a decade he was one of the top money earning actors in Hollywood.

Of course one can not think of instant stardom without mentioning **Moonlighting** star Bruce Willis who landed the part of action hero John McClane in **Die Hard** and never looked back.

What other movies can you think of that completely changed the trajectory of an actor's career? "
10,"I, Tonya (2017) Margot Robbie was about the only thing I liked about **Suicide Squad** and now seeing her in **I, Tonya** one can only wait in anticipation of her taking on more roles with that kind of meat as she was just fantastic as Tonya Harding.  She should get an Oscar nomination alone just for holding her own against Allison Janney in that movie."
10,"Great Moments in Mediocre Movies. There is certainly no shortage of bad movies out there but let us take a look at films that didn't quite work but at least had a moment or two that the filmmakers completely nailed.

Take for example Luc Besson's science fiction epic [Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets](http://manapop.com/film/valerian-and-the-city-of-a-thousand-planets-2017-review/) that though it failed to engage with most audiences it did have a couple of fantastic moments such as the opening montage showing mankind's progression into space and my favorite moment with Rhianna as the [Bubbles the shapeshifting alien dancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm08ekh3ooc), it's a great scene and an excellent character that sadly deserved a better movie.

What other ""bad"" films have moments of glory?"
10,"Is ""A Christmas Carol"" the best adapted work of literature? The cry of *""The book was better!""* is common when it comes to watching a movie based on a book but that is definitely not the case with **A Christmas Carol** by Charles Dickens.  Now there have certainly been many books that have gotten decent movie versions, Shakespeare has had more than a few, but the sheer amount of versions of this particular Christmas ghost story is staggering and more amazing is that a large percentage of them are really quite good.

We've go the classic Alister Sims version from 1951 (which isn't even the first adaptation as about ten other adaptations preceded it) then there is the musical **Scrooge** starring Albert Finney released in 1970, Mickey Mouse and the Muppets both did a fairly good takes on the Dickens story, a personal favorite of mine is the Bill Murray film **Scrooged**, and I even like the motion-capture Robert Zemekis film starring Jim Carey as it is *extremely* faithful to the source material.  

Those are just a few of the film adaptations of this great yuletide tale, not even going into the dozens of versions that have graced the small screen, and so I think it's clear that **A Christmas Story** has the best track record for good adaptations.  I certainly can't think of a story that's been done this many times and so well."
10,"Best Out of Character Roles. Many actors find themselves pigeonholed playing certain types of characters because that is what the audience has come to expect from them, and the studios don't really want to rock the boat, but when an actor makes a break from the expected it can be a glorious thing.

I recently re watched **Once Upon a Time in the West** and Henry Fonda's portrayal of the merciless killer Frank is simply chilling.  Fonda, mostly known for playing lovable dads, honest citizens and even The President, must have had a blast with this chance to stretch as an actor.  If you haven't seen this great  Sergio Leone film you need to check it out.

What other actors have taken this kind of leap?"
10,"What franchise should be allowed to rest in peace? I recently watched [Amityville: The Awakening](http://manapop.com/film/amityville-the-awakening-2017-review/) and not only is it just a collection of jumps scares but doesn't bring anything new to a franchise that has somehow lasted ten films.  I just don't see audiences clamoring for more Amityville films so this is one series that I think should be laid to rest.

What film series do you think should be put to bed?"
10,"The original Planet of the Apes had the hardest sequels to write. The original 1968 **Planet of the Apes** has the quintessential twist ending that totally floored audience back in the day, it was the perfect ending to an excellent movie, but where do you go from there if you want to cash in on the success of that movie?

Charlton Heston had no interest in doing a sequel so James Franciscus was hired to play a astronaut Brent who was searching for Heston's character of Taylor, but due to the laws of physics established in the first film Taylor wasn't to return to Earth long after everyone he knew was dead.  This begs the question, ""*Why was he ever reported missing?*""  Adding to the writers grief is that Heston would only return for his cameo if there was no chance of further movies, that they would literally blow up the planet at the end.

Then comes **Escape from the Planet of the Apes** where writers had the task of coming up with a sequel that follows the Earth being blown up.  Not an easy thing to do.  Well they jumped on the ""time travel"" angle with three apes having some how got Taylor's spacecraft operational, launched it into space and then where thrown through time when the planet exploded.  How a race of apes, that are clearly in pre-industrial times, managed to get a space-ship from the bottom of a lake, fix it and launch it into space is beyond ludicrous.  Not to mention that all that crashed on the planet was the capsule and the apes would need to build a booster rocket and a gantry, all in the time between the end of the first movie and the end of the second one.

The writers of the time must of been banging their heads against the wall every time a studio head walked in the door demanding another impossible sequel."
10,"William Fichtner one of the greatest character actors of our time. He's appeared in major blockbuster such as **Armageddon** and **The Dark Knight** playing anything from military commanders to mob bankers, always bringing something fresh to the role, and one of my favorite performances is of his would be his part as the Devil's Accountant in **Drive Angry** where he pretty much stole the movie away from Nicholas Cage.

No matter whether the movie is good or bad, or if his part is small or large, I always look forward to seeing him when he pops up in a film.

Who else shares the love of Fichtner?"
10,"1922 is another Stephen King Netflix Original that kicks butt. Could be that Netflix will become the home of good Stephen King adaptations as this latest one is just fantastic.  Thomas Jane gives a riveting performance as a farmer who makes the decision to murder his wife so she can't sell her share of the farm and take his boy.  The movie goes into some dark EC comic territory with revenge from beyond the grave and if you are afraid rats this movie will terrify you.

This is a must see."
10,"Worst Bond Moments. The Bond franchise is well over fifty years old with multiple actors playing the character, and over those years there have been good Bond movies, not so good ones, and some kind of terrible ones, and today I'd like to look back at some of the moments in the Bond franchise that have us wondering, *""What the hell were they thinking?""*

What are your least favorite moments in Bond? Was it the pigeon doing a double take in **Moonraker**?  How about that horrible CGI surfing scene in **Die Another Day**?

What moments in Bond really bugged you?"
10,"Bizarre Musicals Worth Checking Out. When one thinks of musicals Gene Kelly dancing down rain soak streets in **Singin in the Rain** or Judy Garland belting out ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" in **The Wizard of Oz** easily come to mind, but as much as I love those classic musicals I do have a soft spot for the ones that are a little offbeat.  Some of my favorites are...

[The Apple](http://manapop.com/film/the-apple-1980-review/): This film is clearly in the ""So bad it's good"" category as we get a disco/rock opera released when disco was clearly dead.  The bizarre choice of using a biblical allegory mixed with the story of Faust made for one of the best nonsensical movies out there.

[Bugsy Malone](http://manapop.com/film/bugsy-malone-1976-review/): Directed by Alan Parker gives us a musical that takes place in the Roaring 20s but in world that consists solely of children.  Songs by the great Paul Simon as well as an excellent performance by a young Jodi Foster as torch singer make this a must see.
 
[Phantom of the Paradise](http://manapop.com/film/phantom-of-the-paradise-1974-review/): In this Brian DePalma musical we get another Faustian tale but one mixed up a bit of the Phantom of the Opera.  Once again we get Paul Simon doing some fantastic stuff.

[The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T](http://manapop.com/film/the-5000-fingers-of-dr-t-1953-review/): This the only movie written for the screen by Dr. Seuss himself and tells the story of kid who really doesn't want to take piano lessons.  The crazy stylized world the kid gets sucked into has to be seen to be believed.

What are some of your favorite off beat and ""bizarre"" musicals?

"
10,"Dumbest Film Plots. The 1991 film **Eve of Destruction** had Gregory Hines trying to stop a military robot that was designed to look just like her creator, the idea being you can easily smuggle a nuke into Russia if it's hidden inside a lifelike robot, but the plot is completely moronic because she goes rogue during one of her tests and for some fucking insane reasons they installed a *LIVE NUKE* for the testing process.

What other films fail right of out the gate because of ridiculous plots? "
10,"Sequels where none of the original cast returns. When a movie makes a ton of money it's no surprised that studio execs will quickly scramble to see about getting a sequel greenlit, this can result in something awesome like **The Empire Strikes Back** or it could end up being more like **Highlander: The Quickening,** but what if the studio doesn't want or can't acquire the original cast?  Does that doom the sequel from the get go?

[Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf](http://manapop.com/film/howling-ii-your-sister-is-a-werewolf-1985-review/) was a sequel to Joe Dante's horror classic and despite that movie ending with an obvious sequel hook, with the character of evil werewolf Marsha surviving, the sequel ended up being about the lead characters brother.  Apparently director Philippe Mora had asked the studio if he could go off and do his own thing with the series, and they agreed.  The question is why?  Doesn't seem like a fiscally responsible way to take a sequel.

What other sequels ditch the original cast?  And if so did they work?"
10,"The Hitman's Bodyguard Did Not Know When To End. Just watched **The Hitman's Bodyguard** and boy did that thing need some serious editing. The last half entails a prolonged boat chase, a side chase with goons after Ryan Reynolds for absolutely no reason, then our heroes get to their final destination and we get more explosions and gunfights, a hospital is attacked so the villains can steal a helicopter, Ryan's ex-girlfriend has lame fight with her evil boss in the hallway of the courthouse, and then the bad guy is finally dispatched.

The film's final forty minutes is just so much noise that you are soon begging for it to end. Bloody pointless action as well as a waste of Gary Oldman.
"
10,"Collateral Beauty and the Lie of Marketing. I recently watched the Will Smith movie [Collateral Beauty](http://manapop.com/film/collateral-beauty-2016-review/) and after watching it was quite pissed at how the marketing of the film spun it as a heartwarming fantasy where a grieving man is contacted by the the incarnations of Death, Time and Love but what the trailer and ad campaign left out was the whole part where his work associates hire actors to gaslight the poor bastard so that he can be declared mentally unfit and thus they can gain control of his voting rights.  That isn't a minor plot thread that is the whole fucking movie, sure the film throws in a ridiculous twist at the end (two actually) to try and justify the ad campaign but all it does is come across as lame last minute pandering to save a terrible movie. "
10,"Movies you wish had stuck with the first draft. The Stallone/Snipes movie **Demolition Man** is a fun flick but we got was quite far from what was originally intended.  In the original script both John Spartan and Simon Phoenix were horribly racist, and when Phoenix is awoken in the way distant future (not the twenty or thirty ridiculous years we got where somehow people have forgot what murder is) they wake up Spartan because this utopian society can't handle some one like Phoenix.  Of course these two raging assholes almost destroy society as they fight and blow up everything around them.

Whether this was changed because Stallone didn't want to play a racist I don't know, but damn would I have loved to see that version."
10,"Tower (2016) Documentary Just watched the animated documentary film directed by Keith Maitland called **The Tower** that deals with the University of Texas killings by sniper Charles Whitman in 1966.  For the documentary Maitland chose to use animation to depict the events, as it would have been unlikely for them to get permission to shoot on location, but with the use of hours of interviews and testimony he manages to make you feel like you were there.  This is a powerful documentary and an event that should not be forgotten.

In 1975 there was a television movie called [The Deadly Tower](http://manapop.com/film/the-deadly-tower-1975-review/), starring Kurt Russell, and it does do a fairly good job of depicting the events but this documentary gives you a clearer look into what went on and how the people involved felt.  I highly recommend seeing this one."
10,"Favorite Incarnation of Death in the Movies. From the skeletal Grim Reaper of **A Christmas Carol** to the more sublime use of Death in Ingmar Bergman's **The Seventh Seal** we've seen many cinematic versions of Death, in the **Final Destination** franchise they even completely did away with the anthropomorphic personification of Death and replaced it with an invisible Rube Goldberg Machine. 

My favorite is in the 1934 classic film [Death Takes a Holiday](http://manapop.com/film/death-takes-a-holiday-1934-review/) where Death takes on human form to learn why mankind fears him, and of course while doing so he falls in love.  Frederich March is fantastic as Death, the love story angle is simply beautifully handled and the ending of the film is just perfection.

What film gave you your favorite version of Death?"
10,"Failure to Launch. With what seems like every studio scrambling to get some of that franchise money that Marvel Studios is making with their Cinematic Universe its almost become a Hollywood Hunger Games with one after another attempted franchise biting the dust.

Warner Bros attempt a six picture franchise with [King Arthur: Legend of the sword](http://manapop.com/film/king-arthur-legend-of-the-sword-2016-review/) which ended up losing them a boat load of cash.

With the Tom Cruise reboot of [The Mummy](http://manapop.com/film/the-mummy-2017-review/) Universal hoped to get their own franchise called ""Dark Universe"" going but that hoped pretty much died in the crib.  That wasn't even their first attempt as back in 2014 their release of [Dracula Untold](http://manapop.com/film/dracula-untold-2014-review/) was to launch their monster franchise.

What are some of your favorite franchises that failed to launch?  Either good bad.

"
10,"Separating the Artist from the Art. Despite Tom Cruise's couch jumping and weird belief that aliens live in his blood stream I still enjoying going to and watching his movie, Charlton Heston may have been a Right Wing *""From my cold dead hands""* spokesman for the NRA but that will never take away my love for his **Planet of the Apes** or **Ben Hur**, yet when it comes to Jeffrey Jones and his arrest for possession of child pornography that has tainted my feelings for his films and makes watching them a lot harder.

Do the personal lives of actors or directors influence how you see their work?"
10,"Actors trying to break typecasting. If a star has made a mark with the public as a certain type of character the studio is often quite averse in letting that image change.  In Hitchcock's classic film **Suspicion** Cary Grant was to be the murderer but the studio insisted this be changed because they believed the public wouldn't accept Cary Grant as a murderer.

My pick for greatest attempt in breaking out of their typecasting would Kurt Russell, who early in his career was known for his Disney comedies, but in 1975 he played real life crazed sniper Charles Whitman in [The Deadly Tower](http://manapop.com/film/the-deadly-tower-1975-review/), a man who murdered fifteen people from atop the tower of The University of Texas.

It took John Carpenter's **Escape From New York** to fully change Russell's career trajectory but this role as a mad sniper is about the boldest attempt at trying to break free of the system that I can think of.

What are some other good examples of actors trying to escape typecasting?"
10,"How did that even get made? Making movies isn't easy, the amount of things that can go wrong is staggering, but there are some movies that any sane person wouldn't have even tried to go forward with.

A good example of this is the movie [Roar](http://manapop.com/film/roar-1981-review/) where Director/producer/writer/star Noel Marshall cast his actual family in a movie that would pit them against a large quantity of lions, but without actually using trained lions or professional trainers.  To say things went bad is an understatement as pretty much most of the cast and crew found themselves at the wrong end of a tooth or claw; Melanie Griffith herself was mauled by a lion and required plastic surgery, requiring fifty stitches to her face.  Not only did the movie tank but I'm sure he lost the ""Father of the Year"" spot as well.

What other movies out there are hard to believe got made?"
10,"What are some good genre mash-ups? Sci-fi/horror is probably the most common mash-up of two genres, with Ridley Scott's **Alien** being the king of those, but there are many more worth checking out.

[Killer Fish](http://manapop.com/film/killer-fish-1979-review-2/) (1979) Is a heist movie with Lee Majors and company pulling off a fantastic robbery, but when the underwater hiding spot for the loot turns out to be the home of some particularly nasty piranhas the film becomes man-against-nature.

What are some of your favorite genre mash-ups?"
10,"A favorite book you'd love to see adapted. I'm a huge fan of the [Tarzan books](http://manapop.com/books/tarzan-and-friends-the-worlds-of-edgar-rice-burroughs/) yet we've never really had a faithful adaption of the classic Edgar Rice Burroughs hero, but as we certainly don't need another half-assed origin story I'd pick one of the later books.

[Tarzan the Untamed](http://manapop.com/books/tarzan-the-untamed-edgar-rice-burroughs-book-review/) deals with Tarzan throwing off the shackles of civilization when he discovers his beloved Jane murdered by the Germans at the outset of the first world war.

How awesome is this book?  Well at one point Tarzan captures a lion, starves and and beats the beast into submission, and then forces it into the German trenches. When the hapless German soldiers flee the trenches Tarzan is there waiting for them, with machine gun in hand, and he rakes them with a deadly hail of bullets.

That's a Tarzan movie I'd love to see.

What favorite book of yours would you love to see adapted?"
10,"Disney's Dexter Riley Trilogy with Kurt Russell I've been going through a lot of Kurt Russell's older films and I must say I do have a soft spot for the Dexter Riley trilogy from Disney.

[The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (1969)](http://manapop.com/film/the-computer-wore-tennis-shoes-1969-review/) Kurt Russell plays college student Dexter Riley who gets electrocuted one night while in the school's computer lab and thus he now has the brain of a computer. Science was great in the late sixties. It's a fun film full of wacky hijinks with the villainous A.J. Arno, played by the great Cesar Romero, trying to use Dexter's brains for nefarious purposes.

[Now You See Him, Now You Don't (1972)](http://manapop.com/film/now-you-see-him-now-you-dont-1972-review/) In the second chapter of the trilogy Medfield College is once again in financial troubles and their only hope of escaping foreclosure is winning a $50,000 science contest. Kurt Russell's Dexter Riley accidentally develops an invisibility formula that eventually catches the eye of returning villain A.J. Arno. There is some nice invisibility gags using practical effects but anytime they rely on optical effects they look pretty bad.

[The Strongest Man in the World (1975)](http://manapop.com/film/the-strongest-man-in-the-world-1975-review/) In this last installment in the Dexter Riley series Kurt Russell and friends accidentally develop a super strength formula that could save the once again cash strapped Medfield College. This entry once again has Cesar Romero returning as the villain but we also get Eve Arden, Phil Silvers and Dick Van Patten who want the formula for their respective cereal companies. At this point the formula was wearing kind of thin so it's good that Disney decided to end the series here.

If you are a fan of Kurt Russell's work I highly recommend taking a nostalgic trip back to his days at Disney."
10,"When was the twist ""It was all a dream"" first used? In the movie **The Wizard of Oz** it's revealed at the end that Dorothy had dreamed the whole thing, unlike the book where she did in fact travel to Oz, but was that the first time that twist had been used? 

I know that trope has appeared many, many times on television since then but I can't think of anything before **The Wizard of Oz**."
10,"Welcome to the Punch (2013) Just finished watching the crime/thriller **Welcome to the Punch** starring James McAvoy and Mark Strong and really enjoyed it.  Hadn't even heard about it until someone online recommended it a few days ago and now I finally got the chance to check it out.  

It's your standard cop on the edge movie, played excellently by McAvoy, but it also has an interesting ""antagonist"" played by Mark Strong.  He's the one villain who got away and has been kind of a black spot in McAvoy's life, but when their paths cross three years later things get really interesting.

The movie has some nice action set pieces, one really nice slo-mo sequence, but it's really the dual leads that make this a film worth checking out.

Note: The film also stars David Morrissey who many will know as the Governor from *The Walking Dead*. "
10,"Movies that never got the sequel they deserved. There are so many sequels out there from the Transformer movies to the seemingly endless Friday the 13th series but the percentage of good to bad unfortunately skews heavily into the bad category, then on the other end of the spectrum there are quite a few movies that were excellent, and seemed tailor made for a franchise history, yet never even got one sequel.

In the late 60s Mario Bava gave the world [Danger: Diabolik](http://manapop.com/film/danger-diabolik-1968-review/) a film about a world renowned thief who was suave, cool and an all round badass, but even though it ended with a set-up for a sequel the director did not enjoy working with producer Dino De Laurentiis so no sequel ever saw the light of day.

What great movies have you seen that deserved to get a sequel but never got one?"
10,"What is your favorite depiction of Spider-Man There have been [many versions of Spider-Man](http://manapop.com/musing/the-many-faces-of-spider-man/) over the years, some like the live action [The Amazing Spider-Man](http://manapop.com/tv/the-amazing-spider-man-1977-1979-review/) television show from the 70s are best forgotten, but since Sam Raimi gave the superhero genre a boost back in 2002 we've seen quite a few more takes on everyone's favorite wall crawler.

So what is your favorite adaptation of The Amazing Spider-Man?"
10,"What are the best and worst werewolf movies? There are lots of vampire movies but not nearly enough werewolf based monster movies.  When one thinks of the good examples of the sub-genre the original Lon Chaney Jr version of **The Wolfman** leaps to mind and then you jump to **An American Werewolf in London** and **The Howling**.  On the badside you have the completely nuts sequel to **The Howling** called [Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf](http://manapop.com/film/howling-ii-your-sister-is-a-werewolf-1985-review/), and then there is the rather lame **An American Werewolf in Paris** sequel/spin-off.

What do you consider the best and the worst of the werewolf genre?"
10,"Godzilla and my Nieces. I have twin nieces who are just a little over four years old and one day they came over while I was working on a review for a Godzilla movie, they were fascinated with the movie and now whenever they come over they *""Wanna watch Zilla!""* and they will sit in my lap and watch the Godzilla fight off numerous foes.  Of course I've got to fast forward through all that boring ""people stuff"" but they really get invested with what is going on with the monsters, especially if Baby Godzilla makes an appearance.

So if you have little girls in your home maybe you should give them a break from watching Disney Princesses and show them a Godzilla film, they may just fall in love with the big green galoot. "
10,"Could the big Hollywood musical return in earnest? With the success of Disney's live action [Beauty and the Beast](http://manapop.com/film/beauty-and-the-beast-2017-review/), which like its animated counterpart is a full fledged musical with crowds of people bursting into song, could we see more like it in the future?  

Now Disney has a full slate of live action remakes but previous to the 2016 **Beauty and the Beast** they mostly dropped the musical aspects.  Nobody sang about dreams being a wish your heart makes in the 2015 **Cinderella** and though Bill Murray's Baloo kind of started to sing ""The Bare Necessities"" we were luckily spared further crooning from him in 2016's [The Jungle Book](http://manapop.com/film/the-jungle-book-2016-review/), but with the success of this latest adaptation there is a very good chance that **The Little Mermaid** and **Aladdin** will be bursting with musical numbers as well, and if they are successful could that inspire other non-Disney filmmakers to give big musicals a shot.  Sure there have been successes with films like **Chicago** and **Moulin Rouge** but I would love to see musicals become at least a big a genre as superhero movies."
10,"Before Avatar broke box office records a softcore sex comedy held the title of most successful 3D movie. It was in the 50s that we saw the golden era of 3D films with such classics as [It Came From Outer Space](http://manapop.com/film/it-came-from-outer-space-1953-review/) but by the mid-50s the format was already in a quick decline and wouldn't be revived until later in the 60s when a cheaper single-strip format was developed.

The first film to use this new technology was the softcore sex comedy [The Stewardesses](http://manapop.com/film/the-stewardesses-1969-nsfw-review/) which costing $100,000 to produce eventually netted $27 million at the box office making it the most successful 3D motion picture until James Cameron's movie about blue aliens came around decades later.

It's a shame with the current 3D run of films we've never got another sex comedy...maybe someday we will get **Porky's II in 3D**.  Until then I recommend you check out **The Stewardesses** as though it isn't a very good film it is a moment in history."
10,"I'd love to see a new Goldie Hawn-Kurt Russell comedy. The new comedy Snatched is no work of comic genius but it does show that even after fifteen years from her last big screen outing Goldie Hawn still has it, and of course Kurt Russell has proven that he is as charismatic a star as ever so I'd love to see these two back together again in a comedy.

I could see the two of the working a nice action comedy genre quite well ie couple on vacation and get caught up with spies or such."
10,"Could Bugsy Malone be made today? If you were a kid in the late 70s you may have had the chance to see [Bugsy Malone](http://manapop.com/film/bugsy-malone-1976-review/) in theaters, it was an Alan Parker directed film where we see the world of the Roaring Twenties populated solely by children.  It's also a musical with all the singing being dubbed by adult vocalists including the legendary Paul Williams, but I think what would be a harder sell to studios today is seeing young girls dressed like 20s speakeasy dancers.

Check out Jodi Foster as torch singer [Tallulah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulEG7bd1H60&feature=youtu.be&list=RDsA_0cvd1EUM) and asks yourself, ""Would modern audiences be up in arms over stuff like this?"""
10,"Favorite weird and goofy movies. Some films are just so bizarre and goofy you can't help but love them, the more insane or nonsensical the plot the better, and it doesn't matter if they are big budgeted films or lowly B-Movies they are films that just make you smile.

One of my favorites is the Shaw Brothers film [The Super Inframan](http://manapop.com/film/the-super-inframan-1975-review/) where the hero is turned into a bionic Kung Fu superhero, *“We will wire your arms and legs with powerful transistors and death rays. You will be powered by a tiny nuclear reactor. Unfortunately, the operation will be very painful and you may die.”*  It's a movie I can't help but love.

What are your favorite goofy movies?"
10,"What are your favorite time travel movies? Time travel in movies is one of the biggest sub genres of science fiction swinging from classic tales like H.G. Wells **The Time Machine** to the more paradoxical offerings like [Predestination](http://manapop.com/film/predestination-2014-review/), and the entire [Terminator franchise](http://manapop.com/musing/time-travel-and-the-terminator-movies/) manages to contain some of the best and worst aspects of the genre, but what time travel movies are your favorites?"
10,"How I would have ended Spielberg's Hook. The key element of Peter Pan's character is that he never grows up and in the book it shows that Peter has no real way to retain memories for if he did he would just be an immortal in a child's body and not an eternal child.

If I was to make a movie where Pan grew up and had to return to Neverland to rescue his children I'd have the moment when he finally embraces ""The Pan"" he'd physically transform back to his younger self and his memories of his adult life would fade.

The reborn Peter Pan would easily defeat Hook and his pirate crew but this would lead to a nice moment where young Peter encounters his daughter, who would now be the same age as her dad, and she and her brother would want to go home but Peter wouldn't even know who they were.

His daughter would then show him a locket with a picture of old Peter and his wife, this would result in a flood of memories returning to him and he would renounce his eternal youth and return to being middle age Peter Bannon.  His love for his family being more important than the carefree life of Peter Pan,"
10,"Question about Office Christmas Party. If we go with the idea that Olivia's Munn's magical innovation that combines internet WiFi with wired connections actually works wouldn't they all go to jail for what would be perceived as a proof of concept publicity stunt?

They would really have no way of proving that the knocking out of Chicago's internet hub was not intentional.  I wonder how many things they'd be charged with."
10,"Is there a more 80s movie than ""The Secret of My Success?"" Just re-watched **The Secret of My Success** and not only does it star Michael J. Fox, one of the most 80s actors ever who gives a performance that is one part Marty McFly and two parts Alex P. Keaton, it has an up tempo score by David Foster that also includes hits from Banarama and Pat Benatar, add the yuppie theme and the wardrobe and you have an almost perfect time capsule of the 1980s.  

It really took me back to when I first saw the film in 1987."
10,"What is the worst killer shark movie? I recently watched the 80s Jaws rip-off [The Last Shark](http://manapop.com/film/the-last-shark-1981-review/) and it got me thinking of the countless amounts of bad shark films that followed Spielberg's original.  Would you consider one of the [Shark Attack](http://manapop.com/film/shark-attack-3-megalodon-2002-review/) movies to be the worst?  Maybe the self-aware [Sharknado](http://manapop.com/film/sharknado-the-4th-awakens-2016-review/) films? Or possibly even one of the **Jaws** sequels like [Jaws: The Revenge](http://manapop.com/film/jaws-the-revenge-1987-review/).

What do you consider to be the worst shark movie?"
10,"How about a new Thomas Edison movie? With the success of **The Founder** it'd be nice to see an unvarnished look at Thomas Edison.  A film that would deal with certain unpleasant facts.

*  To promote his current over Tesla's Edison executed a circus elephant with electricity as a promotional stunt.

* When any workers improved on an existing invention (like the light bulb) or discovered something new, Edison immediately patented it under his name.

* Edison had men steal a copy of Georges Méliès’s masterpiece “A Trip to the Moon” to make copies and took those to America and made a fortune while almost ruining Méliès in the process.

Those are just few examples of how ruthless and dickish the ""Father of Electricity"" was and would certainly result in a fascinating movie."
10,"Sergeant York vs Hacksaw Ridge Two very good war movies with somewhat similar ideologies yet two different takes on violence and what it means to be a hero.

Sergeant Alvin York was prone to violence in his early years but then he vowed to change his behavior and joined Church of Christ in Christian Union.  When World War One broke out he initially claimed conscientious objector status on the grounds that his religious denomination forbade all forms of violence, but his skills with a gun led him to be one of the most famous soldiers of the war earning him the Distinguished Service Cross and the Medal of Honor.

Desmond Doss was raised as a devout Seventh-day Adventist and decried all forms of violence but after his brother signed up he to enlisted but as conscientious objector, refusing to even hold a gun, and he ended up being the only conscientious objector to receive the medal during World War II.

These two films make interesting back-to-back viewings as not only do they both deal with true events but with people of similar convictions with two vastly different yet similar outcomes, both became heroes in totally different ways."
10,"""When is a Sequel Just a Lazy Remake?"" Over on r/horror in a discussion of [Blair Witch (2014)](http://manapop.com/film/blair-witch-2016-review/) I considered that film to be almost a remake rather than a sequel as it doesn't bring much new to the story nor does it move any characters from the original forward, but one commentator stated *""That would make every Friday the 13th, Halloween, Elm Street, etc basically a remake. Just because the formula is the same, doesn't mean it's a remake.""*

Does a sequel need to offer more?"
10,"Could Fred Astaire be a star today? Just watching **The Gay Divorcee** (1934) where Fred Astaire plays and American who stalks a girl trying to get a divorce in London.  The girl is played by the stunning Ginger Rodgers, who was 22 years younger than Astaire, and the pairing of these two lasted ten films.  The thing is Fred Astaire isn't handsome like Cary Grant or Clark Gable, but he was an insanely great dancer and a fairly good actor, and I wonder if the Hollywood of today would cast a romantic lead that looked like Astaire today."
10,"Who is your favorite Tarzan? Tarzan films span almost one hundred years with several incarnations from live action to animation, which Tarzan is your favorite?

Johnny Weissmuller is probably one of the most well known Tarzan's beginning his run with [Tarzan the Ape Man](http://manapop.com/film/tarzan-the-ape-man-1932-review/) in 1932 and followed it up with a eleven more.

Glen Morris interrupted Weissmuller's run with his one entry [Tarzan's Revenge](http://manapop.com/film/tarzans-revenge-1938-review/).

Lex Barker started his five picture run as the ape man with [Tarzan's Magic Fountain](http://manapop.com/film/tarzans-magic-fountain-1949-review/).

Gordon Scott first appeared as Tarzan in [Tarzan's Hidden Jungle](http://manapop.com/film/tarzans-hidden-jungle-1955-review/) which was the last of the RKO Tarzan films. Scott's best films in his run was [Tarzan's Greatest Adventure](http://manapop.com/film/tarzans-greatest-adventure-1959/).

Jock Mahoney dons the loin cloth for [Tarzan Goes to India](http://manapop.com/film/tarzan-goes-to-india-1962/) in 1962 and his run only lasted two films.

Mike Henry was almost Jame Bond like in his first entry with [Tarzan and the Valley of Gold](http://manapop.com/film/tarzan-and-the-valley-of-gold-1966-review/) which was followed by two more rather fun flicks.

Miles O’Keefe in [Tarzan the Ape Man](http://manapop.com/film/tarzan-the-ape-man-1981-review-nsfw/) in 1981 was more about seeing Bo Derek naked than anything else.

Christopher Lambert in [Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan Lord of the Apes](http://manapop.com/film/tarzan-the-ape-man-1981-review-nsfw/) was the first attempt to make a ""realistic"" adaptation of the Tarzan story.

Casper Van Dien in [Tarzan and the City of Gold](http://manapop.com/film/tarzan-and-the-lost-city-1998-review/) was a throwback to the old Tarzan movies.

Tony Goldwyn voiced the Ape Man for [Disney's Tarzan](http://manapop.com/film/tarzan-1999-review/) which brought a hole new audience to the character.

Alexander Skarsgård in [The Legend of Tarzan](http://manapop.com/film/the-legend-of-tarzan-2016-review/) was a big budget attempt to launch a Tarzan franchise.
"
10,"""From the studio that brought you..."" When a poster sports the tagline *""From the studio that brought you...""* and then lists a very popular and good movie one can pretty much assume there is a good chance this new movie will be crap.

When the 2015 version of [Fantastic Four](http://manapop.com/film/fantastic-four-2015-review/) was released the posters proudly stated, *""From the the studio that brought you X-Men: Days of Future Past.""*  Yet no one from this Fantastic Four movie had anything to do with that particular X-Men movie.

When a posters states *""From the director of...""* or *""From the writer of...""* a person can kind of gauge the quality of this new product.  If you liked **Hellboy** there is a good chance you will like **Pacific Rim**, but if the best thing you can say is it came from the same studio, well that is just useless information."
10,"Overlooked Christmas Favorites. Everyone has a [must watch list](http://manapop.com/musing/its-not-christmas-if-i-havent-watched/) of Christmas favorites, but there are lot of good Christmas movies out that are often overlooked or not even heard of by the general public.

One I think fits well into this category is [Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale](http://manapop.com/film/rare-exports-a-christmas-tale-2010-review/) which is a dark/fantasy tale about a boy dealing with a very scary version of Santa.

What are some other overlooked Holiday movies that are worth checking out?"
10,"Are the Ouija movies the strangest marketing campaigns ever? Having recently watched the excellent [Ouija: Origin of Evil](http://manapop.com/film/ouija-origin-of-evil-2016-review/), are rare case of a prequel being better than the [original](http://manapop.com/film/ouija-2014-review/), I couldn't help wondering how these movies effect sales of the actual Ouija board.

These films are co-produced by Platinum Dunes and Hasbro, the makers of the Ouija board, and it does seem odd to me for a manufacturer to basically advertise, *""Play our game and there is a good chance you could die horribly.""*

Is this a case of any publicity is good publicity?  

What other strange marketing choices in movies are there?"
10,"What is a movie that you are surprised doesn't exist. Recently read [Tarzan at the Earth's Core](http://manapop.com/books/tarzan-at-the-earths-core-edgar-rice-burroughs-book-review/) and I found it surprising that a movie that would pit Tarzan against dinosaurs doesn't exist.  With [Jurassic World](http://manapop.com/film/jurassic-world-2015-review/) making tons of money and [The Legend of Tarzan](http://manapop.com/film/the-legend-of-tarzan-2016-review/) doing fairly well it makes sense to me that this movie should happen.

10,"Favorite Movie In-Joke Often director's will sneak in something to see if fans are paying attention, and one of my favorites is in the 1987 movie **Stakeout**, where Richard Dreyfus and Emilio Estevez are stuck watching the house belonging to a wanted villain's girlfriend, and they play a trivia game to pass the time.  Estevez gives Dreyfus the quote,""*This was no boating accident!*""  and Dreyfus responds, ""*No idea.*"" Something then happens across the street and we never get the answer, but movie fans will know that it was in fact Dreyfus himself who said that in the movie **Jaws**.

What are your favorite movie in-jokes?"
10,"Looking for Good Foreign Disaster Movies. I'm a huge fan of the disaster movie genre, I grew up on Irwin Allen films, but of late Hollywood movies like [San Andrea](http://manapop.com/film/san-andreas-2015-review/) just don't have the impact of such previous disaster films like **The Poseidon Adventure** and **The Towering Inferno**.

I've recently seen South Korea's answer to Irwin Allen with [The Tower](http://manapop.com/film/the-tower-2012-review/) and Roar Uthaug's Norwegian film [The Wave](http://manapop.com/film/the-wave-2015-review/), both really good, so what I am asking for is recommendations of other good disaster films from other countries."
10,"Worst movie taglines in either a trailer or poster. Taglines are supposed to be punchy and catchy so as to peak ones interests, but often they are misleading if not blatantly wrong.  A prime example of this is the 1976 remake of [King Kong](http://manapop.com/film/king-kong-1976-review/) which had the tagline, *""The most exciting original motion picture event of all time.""* Not only was that insane amount of hyperbole but just how can you bill a movie as original when it's a bloody remake?

What other poster/trailer taglines were very misleading if not completely wrong?"
10,"Great Bits of Animation in Non-Animated Films. Just re-watched **Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt 1** and was struck again on how fantastic the [Story of the Three Brothers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJSh1zkPEvc) animated portion was, which then reminded me of the cool prologue in **Hellboy 2** with the [story of the Golden Army](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-35Wr5T2XIM) and how well that worked as a storytelling tool.

What other movies have used animation to great effect?"
10,"Jaws and the Law of Diminishing Return For every great sequel like **The Godfather: Pt II** there are dozens more like **Exorcist II: The Heretic,** and even **The Godfather** got saddled with a terrible sequel when Coppola went to the well a third time, but for me the epitome of the “Law of Diminishing Returns” is in the **Jaws** franchise.  It went from a great film to a mediocre sequel to two of the worst films Hollywood has ever let loose on the public.  The downward spiral of quality on display is simply amazing, and so over the last few days I took a look at all four **Jaws** films to see just what happened.

[Jaws]( http://manapop.com/film/jaws-1975-review/) a cinematic masterpiece that kept thousands of people away from the water.

[Jaws 2]( http://manapop.com/film/jaws-2-1978-review/) a money making sequel, but without Spielberg at the helm it turned into a weak horror film that focused too much time on its teen-age cast.

[Jaws 3-D]( http://manapop.com/film/jaws-3-d-1983-review/) was an attempt to cash in on the 3D craze but then failed on every level.

[Jaws: The Revenge]( http://manapop.com/film/jaws-the-revenge-1987-review/) is so monumentally absurd it has to be seen to be believed.   It’s so terrible that even most bad movie lovers avoid it.

What other movie franchises have fallen so fast and so hard in quality?

Donovan in **Bridge of Spies** which was just a couple of years before he played Walt Disney and Captain Philips, I'm starting to get a little fatigued with his choices.  

 I'm wondering at what point there will be less people in the world who have not been played by Tom Hanks than there are those that have been.

10,"Harry Potter Question about the Goblet of Fire. What was the whole point of sneaking Harry Potter into the tournament?

If this whole thing was an elaborate plan to get Harry to touch the port key and teleport him to Voldemort it looks to be a case of over planning. Fake Moody could have easily got Harry alone one night and said, ""*Harry, could you hold this thing a moment*,"" and then handed him a port key. So basically their idiotic plan put Harry in numerous instances of possible instant death, when Voldemort needed him alive, when all they had to do was trick him into grabbing any ole port key.

Is there something I'm missing?"
10,"What director would you choose, living or dead, to helm the next DC Extended Universe movie? Having seen what David Ayer did with [Suicide Squad](http://manapop.com/film/suicide-squad-2016-review/) I couldn't help but think what someone like cult directer Russ Meyer's would do with a **Suicide Squad** sequel.  Harley Quin would certainly make a nice fit into a **Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!** type movie.

What director would you like to see tackle a DC movie and which comic book character would the be most apt at handling?"
10,"The Village vs Running out of Time. Just finished reading the book *Running out of Time* by Margaret Peterson Haddix which is about a village in the 1840s that turns out to be a historical preserve and the children don't know it's actually 1996.  When an epidemic of diphtheria breaks out a young girl has to escape into the modern world to get help.

in 2004 M. Night Shyamalan released his movie **The Village** which has pretty much that exact same idea.  Disney responded in the usual way, *''Whatever claims are being made of similarities between the book and the movie have no merit.''*

I can't find any information regarding the lawsuit, or even if the author even went through with the suit, so I'm wondering if anybody has heard any details on this story?"
10,"What Racial Change is Worse in Movies? I recently watched the 70s Disney movie [One of Our Dinosaurs is Missing](http://manapop.com/film/one-of-our-dinosaurs-is-missing-1975-review/) where we see the great Peter Ustinov wearing Asian make-up to play a Chinese agent, though his performance isn't as over-the-top as Mickey Rooney's Japanese character in **Breakfast at Tiffany's** it's still at best a rather unfortunate choice, but then you have Goku in **Dragonball Evolution** played by Justin Chatwin and in **Prince of Persia** they cast Jake Gyllenhaal, both characters that are clearly not meant to be played by white dudes.

The make-up alteration is clearly the more offensive but is changing the characters ethnicity so that you can still cast that ""bankable"" actor that much better? "
10,"When is an homage actually just a rip-off? Recently watched [Harbinger Down](http://manapop.com/film/harbinger-down-2015-review/) which was supposed to be proof that practical effects are still as viable as CGI, but all the elements lifted from John Carpenter's **The Thing** went well beyond ""homage"" and robbed the film of any originality.

10,"Do we really need realistic versions of myths? What is it with Hollywood that it often likes to take the magic and wonder out of a classic story?

In 2004 Antoine Fuqua gave us a **King Arthur** without a magic sword or a wizard, and before that we had **First Knight**, with Gere was the worst Lancelot ever, but once again no magic.  

Now in the case of the Trojan War the changes made to the 2004 movie from the myth are incredibly drastic; in the Greek myth the entire war originated from a quarrel between the goddesses Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite, after Eris gave them the ""Apple of Discord""  and then Wolfgang Petersen's **Troy** leaves out the gods entirely.  Achilles's invulnerability and famous weakness is ignored in the movie but for some reason he still gets shot in the ankle.

What are other examples of movies where Hollywood took what was a myth or straight out fantasy and gave us a ""realistic"" version?

Do you as an audience prefer an un-magical versions of myths?"
10,"Favorite Movies About Hollywood. Recently watched the Coen Brothers movie **Hail, Caesar!** and it made me realize that Hollywood's take on themselves is almost it's own genre.  There are certainly quite a few of them.

One of my favorites is the Burt Reynolds comedy about stuntmen [Hooper](http://manapop.com/film/hooper-1978-review/), I saw it when I was just kid and thought it really gave one a nice look behind the curtain...if not all that accurately.

Recently watched [The Huntsman: Winter's War](http://manapop.com/film/the-huntsman-winters-war-2016-review/) and with such movies as that one and  **Oz the Great and Powerful**, as well as Disney remaking every animated classic into live action movie, it looks like Hollywood hopes to make fairy tale movies as popular as superhero movies.  

So far the track record isn't all that successful which makes me wonder if it will die faster than the blockbuster superhero genre."
10,"What songs should be retired from being overused in movies? There are quite a few popular songs that have pretty much turned into film cliches.  Simon and Garfunkel's *""The Sounds of Silence""* has become an emotional shortcut in several movies from **The Graduate** to **The Watchmen**. It's a great song, but can we find a new one?

The one over used song I pray gets retired is The Clash's *""London is Calling""* which seems to be many filmmakers way of telling the audience that they are in London.  When I went to see [The Conjuring 2](http://manapop.com/film/the-conjuring-2-2016-review/) and the Warrens were asked by the church to investigate a haunting in London I didn't need to hear that Clash song to know that we were in fucking London.

What songs do you think need to be retired due to overuse?"
10,"Best ""We're fucked"" moment in a movie. I just love the moment in a movie where the villain or villains realize they are totally screwed.

My favorite example is in **Equilibrium** where the head of a squad of police finds the puppy in Christian Bales trunk and realizes that the ""sense offender"" here is one of the Grammaton Clerics, a person capable of taking down numerous opponents without breaking a sweat.  The look on this poor sods face was priceless.

What are some of your ""We're fucked"" moments?"
10,"Worst Moments in Comic to Screen Adaptations. Comics and movies are two different mediums so when one translates to the other changes are going to happen, some times those changes can be good and then some times the can be godawful. 

For some reason screenwriters often like everything to ""be connected"" so they will do stuff like make The Joker the killer of Bruce Wayne's parents, but then they will do something even dumber like give April O'Neil a history/backstory connection with the turtles.  

This is my pick for dumbest change from comic to screen.  In Michael Bay's [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles](http://manapop.com/film/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-2014-review/) we find out that the turtles were originally test subjects in little April O'Neil's father's lab, and that April helped take care of them like pets.  When the lab is set on fire she rescues the turtles from the flames, and then she chucks them in the sewer.  Why in the ever lovin' hell would she toss creatures she cared for down the sewer?  This makes no sense whatsoever and is there just to force some ""connection"" between characters.

What is your pick for worst change from source material to screen?"
10,"Mads Mikkelsen: What a Fantastic Actor. Most will know Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen from his villainous role in the movie **Casino Royal** or as the title character in the **Hannibal** television series, but if you haven’t seen his less Hollywood work you need to check some of them out.  I’ve not seen all his film but here are a few I can highly recommend.

**Flame & Citron** (2008) Mikkelsen plays real life WWII resistance fighter Jørgen Haagen Schmith (codename: Citron) who along with his partner waged a brutal battle with occupying German forces.

**Valhalla Rising** (2009) Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn this film has Mikkelsen play One-Eye, a mute warrior who ends up joining a group of Crusaders bent on going to the Holy Land, but don’t exactly make it there, and with disastrous results.

**The Door** (2009) Mikkelsen plays a man whose daughter drowns while he is across the street having an affair with the neighbor.  His life falls apart but then he finds a strange door that leads to an Earth that is five years behind our own.  He can save his daughter and correct his life, one small problem, there is the “him” on this Earth to deal with.

**The Hunt** (2012) Sexual abusing a child is one of the most abhorrent crimes out there, and there have been many films on this subject, but in this one Mikkelsen plays a kindergarten teacher who is falsely accused.  The devastation this causes is heart rendering terrible.

**Salvation** (2014) Mikkelsen plays a Danish settler who kills a notorious villain for murdering his wife and child, but when that villain’s even more dangerous brother comes for revenge the cowardly town’s people give the poor Dane up.

10,"Would this kind of movie work today? There are many movies that are simply a product of their time. **The Birth of a Nation** is being remade but I doubt director Nate Parker is going with the ""Pro Klan"" theme.

Now recently I re-watched [Bugsy Malone](http://manapop.com/film/bugsy-malone-1976-review/) where child actors all play adults in a prohibition gangster period piece.  It's a musical where young girls sing and dance, and are dressed rather provocatively, as their adult counterparts would have dressed.
