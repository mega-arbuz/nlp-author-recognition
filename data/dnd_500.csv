1,"In preparation for a D&D campaign based on League of Legends (which never happened), I put together some notes on different locations and alternate universes from the Runeterra setting to help players decide where to center their adventures. Most of these are bare details to use as a starting point, but I figured someone would find them helpful so they were worth posting.

Each location is outlined with a short description of the area and some quick plot hooks, as I didn't know which setting the players would want to work with. If you want more details, go look things up on the wiki.

I know the whole League thing got retconned, but it does such a good job of justifying the setting. You can use it to make arbitrary rules in an adventure about why PCs from opposing nations are working together, or why law enforcement can't just arrest someone, or why the PCs would be used as deniable assets to perform espionage, or why the army doesn't just go in and deal with the monsters, or why a cataclysmic monster has been fettered. Demacia and Noxus could be at war, but they aren't, and if they were they would be using magical nukes. This ancient evil could be conquering the world, but it isn't because a League representative is breathing down its neck and it has to settle for consolidating its power and working from the shadows. This pirate should be tracked down and killed by two navies, but they only have to contend with bounty hunters because they're under the League's protection.

As for rules, I'd probably run this using 5e D&D with liberal allowances for homebrew and Unearthed Arcana and third-party content, [like this other thing I made that would support really odd species.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/827zj0/art_commissioned_a_cover_for_my_dd_manual_and_i/dv81l80/)

---

Demacia: Kingdom of order and altruism.

* Help merchants smuggle contraband and untaxed goods, or work to catch them.

* Be Noxian spies and expose atrocities committed in the name of justice for your own glory.

* A League-enforced treaty doesn't allow Noxian citizens in Demacia to be arrested by Demacian law enforcement unless they are caught in the act, so bounty hunters have found their way into the Demacian legal system.

Freljord: Frozen tundra of tradition and dark secrets.

* Hold off barbarian tribes and servants of the Watchers, frozen horrors that threaten to destroy civilization to sate their appetites.

* Seek out powerful artifacts forged from Trueice (if you have the strength to wield them).

* Side with the Watchers and accept their dark powers so you can help them re-conquer their ancient kingdoms.

Ionia: Continent of magic and untamed wilds.

* Find enlightenment away from the distractions of normal civilization, assuming that whole invasion thing doesn't distract you.

* Join the resistance and fight off Noxian invaders, while being careful not to violate the League-enforced occupation treaty.

* Seek out lost mountaintop ruins while searching for ancient knowledge.

Noxus: Kingdom of warlords and tyrants.

* Raid Noxian weapon testing facilities (which is actually on a mandatory schedule by League-enforced treaty, since it provides good target practice for the experiments).

* By League-enforced treaty, spies in Noxus are executed when captured unless they have delivered spy paperwork every three days to a particular office in the capital. If their paperwork is in order, then they just get thrown over the border (though the enforcers are known to be fond of trebuchets...)

* Help prisoners of war (or escaped experiments) find refuge across the Demacian border.

Piltover: Metropolis of trade and arcane science.

* Get rich doing contract work for wealthy merchant houses and state-sponsored caravans.

* Steal arcane research projects from inventors at the university and sell them to their rivals in the seedy undercity of Zaun.

* Hunt dangerous mutants and clever criminals in the chasms beneath the city.

Serpent Isles: Wondrous islands and rich trade routes.

* Hang out in Bilgewater, the most wretched hive of scum and villany.

* Participate in privateering and pillaging, with law enforcement's hands mostly tied by League-enforced treaty.

* Research the ancient secrets of what squamous horrors lie beneath the waves, or just look for buried treasure.

Shadow Isles: A haunted archipelago shrouded in black mist.

* Defend the innocent from rampaging hordes of the undead.

* Loot powerful relics from the monster-infested ruins of the former Blessed Isles.

* Swear fealty to one of the undead warlords based here and live forever*! (*terms and conditions may apply)

Shurima: Ancient deserts and badlands hosting the ruins of an empire.

* Look for buried lost treasures in ancient tombs!

* Work with mercenaries to protect trade caravans from raiders (or vice-versa).

* Help establish diplomatic relations with this crazy army of thousands of sand warriors that showed up recently.

Alternate Universe: Arcade

* If you die in the game, you die in real life!

Alternate Universe: Battlecast

* Thwart the evil mastermind behind the robot uprising and lead the Resistance to victory!

Alternate Universe: Dragon World

* Who has time for politics? Everything is on fire!

Alternate Universe: High Noon Gothic

* It's high noon...

Alternate Universe: Immortal Journey/Lunar Revel

* Oh, having the whole Ionian Continent in canon wasn't good enough for you? Fine. Here's a whole setting based on Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and Journey To The West.

Alternate Universe: Odyssey

* IN SPACE!!!

Alternate Universe: Omen of the Dark

* Dark Souls? Sure, why not?

Alternate Universe: Mecha

* Save Bandle City from giant monsters using giant mechs!

Alternate Universe: PROJECT/Program

* I hope you've read up on your 19th-century philosophy, because this is gonna get real cyberpunk real fast.

Alternate Universe: Pulsefire

* Timecop! Or time-criminal, either one is cool.

Alternate Universe: Star Guardian

* My name is Luxanna, I'm an ordinary high school student going to Piltover High School. But one day I found a wand that gave me magical powers, and everything changed!

Alternate Universe: Super Galaxy

* IN SPACE!!!, but with super robot mechs instead of real robot mechs."

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A blast of flames shoots from your hand in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage on a failed save. This fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

1,"Most DMs will rule that tuning forks have to be specific to exact planar layers, planets, or crystal spheres. So you could have a set of tuning forks for Eberron, Greyhawk, Toril (and another for Abeir), Avernus, Dis, and Nessus, which would only give you access to the Prime Material Plane and the Nine Hells."
1,"> What ways other than Spelljamming are there to pass from one Crystal Sphere to another? The ideas I've come up with so far are extremely powerful magic, passing through Sigil in the Outlands, finding a portal linking the worlds of two Spheres together, and one thing that I need clarification on... 

Portals are probably the easiest method. Once you have found a portal and know what key opens it, it's usually quite reliable. That information should be kept secret once you have obtained it, as the economic ramifications of reliable access to another world's resources are quite lucrative. You could make a very large fortune trading technology, magic items, and resources between two worlds.

Temporary and unstable portals, or long detours through places like the Feywild, are not reliable and should generally be avoided.

> With all of the Crystal Spheres in existence taken together being part of the Material Plane, does that mean that every setting uses the same outer planes? I.E. the Nine Hells in the Forgotten Realms are the EXACT same Nine Hells in Matt Mercer's Exandria, are the EXACT same Nine Hells in Eberron?

> If that's the case, wouldn't it then be a relatively trivial matter to Plane Shift to an outer plane, then plane shift to a desired location within your destination Crystal Sphere? I.E. If you're in the Forgotten Realms, you planeshift to the Outlands, and then Plane Shift to Greyhawk?

Yeah, basically. The Outer Planes are aware of the multiplicity of Prime Material Planes, but it doesn't come up much because they're usually dealing with a single world at a time. You can actually plane shift directly between Crystal Spheres.

You still need proper tuning forks, *plane shift* has that as a required material component."

* Acid: You can cast the *acid splash* cantrip using Constitution as the casting ability score.

* Amorphous: You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

* Shaping: As an action you can assume a rough facsimile of anything, such as taking the shape of a humanoid to wear armor and wield a weapon. Your abilities remain unchanged. For example, you could grow twenty arms, but this would not give you twenty attacks. Disguises are unlikely to work, as your body is obviously translucent ooze.

1,"Depends on individual casters. Wizards get magic because they study arcana, warlocks and clerics get magic from powerful supernatural beings, druids and rangers get magic from their connection to nature, etc. And not everybody who does those things has magic, since your class levels or stat block are what actually give you abilities.

In Forgotten Realms the ""why"" of things is the Weave, a skein of magic that the neutral goddess Mystra creates and maintains across the world. Everybody accesses it differently, but it's fairly reliable.

https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Weave

It's different in other settings. For example, in Dark Sun mages draw power from living things around them, and this has killed plant life and turned the planet into a desert. In Eberron magic is science that can be learned, and 33% or more of people in the Five Nations can use magic.

> You get a spell that's not normally on your class list but no one tied WoTC's hands when making the warlock spell list. Again, the extended spell list does this and it doesn't make it so you can only use your expanded spells once per day and they don't take up an important class feature. Your solution requires a certain type of DM and it doesn't even address my problem. Say a DM wants to make a warlock subclass, say an elementalist that gets its power from genies. Conjure elemental should probably be on that custom spell list but because it's an invocation, if the DM were to add that spell then it would make that invocation worthless.

You have a lenient DM. :)"
1,"1) You get an extra spell known. Warlocks have very few of those, so picking up a utility spell this way is good.

2) You get a spell that's not normally on your class list. You could ask your DM to allow almost any spell appropriate to your patron in this way. Most DMs will allow this much more readily than they would allow a custom patron."
1,"> ""Hobgoblins in my setting aren't particularly prone to wanting to take everything over, and organize themselves militarily so that they are ready to skirmish and defend their territory easily.""

That's fine for a less evil, more neutral goblinoid race.

> So my question for this problem is how can I make it make sense to my players (and myself) that these super warlike beings are mainly located in a single geographical region. I suppose I could just say, ""Hobgoblins in my setting aren't particularly prone to wanting to take everything over, and organize themselves militarily so that they are ready to skirmish and defend their territory easily."", and I think I might just go with that, but I want to hear any other suggestions.

You could put them in a geographical region that is surrounded on all sides by dangerous monster-infested wilds. That could be one justification for their martial bent.

> My other (less significant) issue is that, reading other sources, it seems that large populations of hobgoblins are meant to be intelligent and advanced enough to form complex governments and build cities, study magic, and have a separate class to be laborers that never see combat. I don't like this flavor, and instead like the idea that all hobgoblins are bred to be warriors, and that like elves, everyone is trained to do a little bit of everything to contribute to society. Again I'll probably just say that these specific hobgoblins are nomadic warriors with just one central fortress, but I'm open to hearing other thoughts.

Hobgoblins are smart enough to study magic, but even in canon hobgoblin society celebrates tactical leadership and martial prowess over magical ability."

> Do you have the character profiles in a book that you get all the info from or do you just make up as you go along ?

You generally start by making your own character, a hero from a variety of class archetypes in the rules, like a battlemaster fighter, an illusionist wizard, an assassin rogue, etc. There is a lot of freedom in character creation, you can easily copy an existing character from popular media or make an original character. There are pre-generated characters available too, but where is the fun in that?

NPCs and monsters have their own rules, but that only matters for the Dungeon Master who is running the game.

> I see people say they got killed by some of the most random event last I have ever heard of, is this out of a pre wrote book or is this something you guys make up on the spot ?

The Dungeon Master has the option to either use a pre-published adventure, or homebrew their own campaign. PCs could die in either case. If you love your ~~special snowflake original character~~ PC and don't want them to die horribly, you should talk with the DM about it. In my experience this varies significantly from group to group, but most people who play D&D prefer low-lethality games."

The magic system is garbage and I hate it. At least Vancian casting was intentionally weird. The 5e magic system is a compromise that tried to simplify things, but it has so many leftover golden cows that I find it abhorrent. New players are baffled by 5e D&D's magic system and its complexity, even when making 1st-level characters. Some classes are prepared casters and others aren't. The magic system has been ingrained into most of the classes and encounter design. If the DM doesn't run the right number of encounters each day, some casters are overpowered and others are crippled.

Dodging, yes. Uncanny dodge is pretty good and doesn't cost a spell slot like *shield* does.

Utility, no. You are a full caster. Your spells are your utility, and high-level spells have insane utility.

> However, would investing some levels as a rouge hinder my characters ability to buff allies, do some crowd control, and keep my friends alive?

*Maybe*. If your college is valor, swords, or whispers, you actually have a good reason to stab someone. Rogue sneak attack can help there, especially if you're dual-wielding with the intent of killing your enemies as fast as possible so that they stop damaging your allies.

> Would the six levels I would have spent on rouge be better spent on a celestial warlock or a divine soul sorcerer?

That really depends what you want out of the multiclass. Most of the high-level spells you get from multiclassing, you can steal using magical secrets. But lots of fun low-level healing spells (healing word, aid, bless, goodberry, lesser restoration) can be picked up with only 1-3 levels.

> I’ve heard some not very great things of the bard’s level 20 ability, so I thought I’d experiment a little.

Most campaigns don't get to level 20. Don't sweat it.

If you really want the variety, I'd recommend a 1-level dip into something that gives you a lot of spells, like druid, wizard, or cleric. It also grants you the ability to use spell scrolls from that class, which will get you most of the utility you want if you can buy the scrolls."

Stuff like the Sharpshooter feat (use with seeking missile, not speed dart), the faithful archer nomadic arrow ability, bonus damage from potent psionics, action surge, extra attack, flying from bestial form or mastery of air, enduring invisibility from nomadic chameleon, etc. That will help inform your multiclassing, as you can compare specific abilities to each other and what they give you, how many dead levels you will get with abilities you don't care about, and then you can ignore the rest of the fluff.

1,"If you are a moon druid, turning into a bear is usually the correct choice. Maybe cast *flaming sphere* or *thorn whip* first, or cast *call lightning* and turn into an eagle and stay at extreme range.

If you are a non-moon druid (probably land druid), you have options. As many options as a caster usually has. It's a lot of options, I don't blame you for having trouble deciding. My flowchart for any spellcaster looks like this:

* Can I decisively end this encounter (or drastically simplify it) with a single spell like *hold person* or *wall of stone* or an AOE that will probably kill all of them? If a saving throw is involved, can I guess which of the six ability scores my enemy will be the worst at?

* Is an ally in extreme danger or under a severe debuff? (At 0 HP and bleeding out, paralyzed, poisoned, caught in spider web.) Can I do anything with *lesser restoration* or *healing word* or simple mundane actions to solve that problem? Do I have any *goodberries* in my pockets I could feed to them as an action?

* Can I shut down a dangerous enemy's most powerful ability? *Fog cloud* or *sleet storm* on archers or spellcasters to force them into melee, *darkness* on the monster with a gaze attack, *entangle* on enemies who have no ranged attacks, etc etc.

* Should I be conserving spell slots for future encounters today? If I'm not worried about this, let's throw out some damage and wrap up this encounter quick. *Call lightning* is neat because I only have to spend one slot and it lasts the whole battle. *Flaming sphere* and *heat metal* are nice because they free up my action for other stuff. Remember that *haste* and *invisibility* are also spells that deal damage, and they're very efficient at dealing that damage because they use your allies' actions to do it.

* Okay, just throw a damage cantrip and stay out of melee."

Lucky you, as a ranged character with spellcasting you don't really need any ability scores other than Dexterity and Intelligence. As you will probably be shooting arrows more than casting spells, get your Dexterity to 20 first, then Intelligence next (but not all your spells use Intelligence, and feats like Lucky or Crossbow Expert can be very useful for you.)

Fighter is a very common multiclass for rogues. The question is what you want out of it, and what rogue abilities you absolutely must have.

* Fighter 1: Archery fighting style gives you +2 to-hit, totally worth it because rogue sneak attack is useless if you miss. Also gives you shield proficiency for the rare scenario where you can't shoot things.

* Fighter 2: Action surge is so broken that every class wants a 2-level fighter dip to get it. You can use it to make a second attack if your first sneak attack misses, or activate a magic item, or cast a spell.

* Fighter 3: First subclass, usually unlocks a very strong ability depending what you pick.

* Fighter 4: ASI or bonus feat, fantastic! But at what cost? At this point you're more of a fighter with rogue levels than a rogue with fighter levels...

* Fighter 5: Extra Attack is great, more damage and more chances to land sneak attack. Also makes the Sharpshooter feat worth considering, because if you land a sneak attack you can make your second attack with the accuracy penalty.

* Fighter 6: Another ASI or bonus feat!

* Fighter 7: Probably don't get this one, it's usually a fluff ability. But Fighter 8 is another ASI or bonus feat..."

One oddity you run into is that a significant amount of the population are heavily skilled or can use magic, enough that standard monsters like goblins and orcs aren't a major threat unless you use them *en masse* or beef up their stats.

You also need to consider class ratios. Rogues are probably the most common class (because of the expertise skill, and sneak attack can be more luck than combat ability), and classes like paladins and warlocks and monks probably aren't that common. You can play with these ratios to have a more high-magic or low-magic world, of course."

Read the Background chapter. Pick ideals, traits, bonds, and flaws you find interesting (most of them can even be good and noble attributes, it's how you approach them that makes you evil). Make sure your PC has good reasons to adventure with the rest of the party and cooperate with them.

> I've never played a wizard. I've mostly played a druid a couple times and I have a rogue currently. I am overwhelmed by all of the trees of choices for wizards and clerics and multiclassing and archetyping and the like. I cant keep straight what fits where without experience and fumbling. I wont be able to fumble this campaign though, so I need to iron it out beforehand. I dont even know what the Necromancy falls under. Archetype? Wizard archetype? Sorcerer? I know I can look that answer up but it's just an example of the many ways I am lost. What spells will I get to choose from if I choose this or that option?

I recommend single-classing to keep things simple. Prepared casters can be overwhelming for new players.

Necromancy school wizard has tons of utility but is squishy. Grave/death/war cleric gets to wear skulls on their armor and wade into melee. Pick the one you find most appealing, then go look at a spell guide specific to that class. Skim the spell lists, take notes on the ones you find interesting, and take particular note of costly material components, casting times, and spell ranges. Write this stuff down so you can quickly reference it as you use the spells during a session.

If you want to keep things really simple, play a divine soul sorcerer. You can steal relevant necromancy spells from the cleric list and have a very small number of spells to work with so you don't get overwhelmed. Another option would be a warlock, if you can convince your DM to let you spend an invocation on animate dead.

As a necromancer the only spells you care about are *animate dead* and *create undead*. Beyond that, you can pick useful spells and fluff them to be necromancer-y, like *hold person* making skeletal hands burst from the earth, or making *find familiar* summon a fiend that looks like a rotting or skeletal animal corpse.

A good justification for this might be that her ancient dragon body only has enough strength in it for one last fight. So if she ever plays the CR 24 dragon card, it's the last thing she'll ever do.

Or you could be less dramatic and say that she spread false rumors that she died, or faked her death in a fight with the Big Bad. Maybe she's trying to lure out the Big Bad, secretly posing as a mortal until the time is right.

They're an ancient dragon? Those are really strong, like CR 24.

I'd use the stats of a human sorcerer or druid. Normally I'd let them shapeshift into draconic form with pretty much exactly the same stats (and maybe flight around 6th level but if they're a sorcerer they can already fly), but that won't work, so... They either are using shapeshifting magic that makes them as weak and vulnerable as a human, or their human body is a construct puppet that can be KOed and the real dragon is sleeping in a cave somewhere, or their #1 priority is not arousing suspicion so they'll fake being unconscious or dead and act it out ""to the hilt.""

Anyways, druid cantrips:

* Thorn Whip: Good if your druid has decent Constitution and and wears shield. Great if you're a moon druid because you can pull someone into melee then turn into a bear.

* Guidance: Let other players know you have this, they'll never want to roll a skill check without it.

* Shillelagh: Dump Strength, don't worry about Dexterity, smite your enemies with a stick. Falls off in usefulness at higher levels because you get wild shape, you get better spells, and enemies get less pleasant in melee.

* Produce Flame: The druid's *firebolt*. Good ranged damage, doubles as a light source.

* Create Bonfire: A rare concentration cantrip, the poor mage's *flaming sphere*. Best-case scenario is to put it in a chokepoint so multiple enemies have to walk through it, or put it on an immobilized enemy.

* Mending: Good if you're a tinker, but I've tried and failed to make this relevant during adventures.

Charisma should probably not be penalized, it affects the Intimidation skill and sorcerer and warlock classes. And classes that don't use Charisma really don't care about the penalty.

Stoneglare should probably require concentration on the medusa's part. Also, you should specify how ""averting the eyes"" rules work, like the Monster Manual entries for petrifying gaze attacks. To account for that kind of thing, I use these rules for PC petrifying gaze attacks:

> Petrifying Gaze

> As an action you can gaze at one creature you can see within 30 feet, causing it to gradually petrify as long as you maintain concentration (the same as concentrating on a spell). As long as the creature can see you, at the start of its turn it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + proficiency modifier + Charisma modifier). The first round the creature fails the saving throw it is restrained, and the second round it fails the saving throw it is petrified.

> This effect ends immediately if anything breaks your concentration or prevents you and the creature from seeing each other. If the creature isn’t surprised, it can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of any of its turns, ending this effect immediately. If the creature averts its gaze in any way, it can’t see you until the start of its next turn.

> If the creature is petrified, the petrification is permanent until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.

It's at-will because averting eyes is so easy, but it uses the medusa's action and makes it more or less on par with a Help or Hide action. If it works, the target's best option is to look away and effectively turn the medusa invisible, which is great for the medusa in most cases. It's effectively a little stronger than a cantrip."

Golems can be shaped like anything the creator can imagine (and is able to make structurally sound). I guess you could make a warforged animal just as much as warforged are humanoid golems.

There is also precedent for this with the tauric belt in the 3e Eberron Campaign Setting book. There are also a few varieties of semi-warforged in the ECS that are not quite humanoid, I think one is called the warforged titan.

> And can a soul of a Wizard, Sorcerer or Warlock possess a Warforged body? Like they are about to die and use a spell to send their soul to a previously prepared Warforged before this one is activated or develops conscience.

The *magic jar* spell achieves this temporarily, and with plot magic (i.e. ""the DM is okay with it"") you could do it permanently. Putting your soul into a construct would be a smart alternative to necromancy, yes. However, a warforged body would be inferior to, say, an iron golem body, or a darksteel golem body.

Get his feedback on long-term plans, how he'd manage his lieutenants, and his interactions with the Big Bad (who can provide his villainy a little direction, like ""dig up this ancient artifact and have it sent to me, as long as you do that you can do whatever you want with the rest of the resources I sent you"").

Most DMs do *neither of those*, so that's why it's generally considered a poor choice compared to a sorcerer.

The whole strict fiendish hierarchy has never made complete sense, it's a holdover from AD&D which had parallel classes of fiends on the Lawful and Chaotic sides. I go on the idea that the Monster Manual entries are categories invented by sages, and those categories are useful when talking about the general abilities of fiends to fight them, but each fiend can be fairly unique. More poweful fiends probably can look like whatever they want.

With homebrew, perhaps. D&D characters normally operate on short rest and long rest ability recharging.

> If so what class/race should I do?

* Sorcerer: Spell harder than any other spellcaster. Use heighten metamagic to force enemies to save-or-die with disadvantage, and twin mind control effects. Even without magic you can have excellent social skills. Any subclass works but I'd recommend shadow bloodline (good at debuffs) or storm bloodline (has some built-in debuffs and fits a witch theme). Can run out of juice in long adventuring days, and has a very small number of spells known.

* Bard: Gets lots of enchantment spells, but is more buff-oriented. Steal the best mind control spells from other class lists. Also be decent at stabbing things, and get short rest buffs for the party. College of lore gets more spells, college of whispers gets some sick abilities you might like. Does not specialize as well as other classes, but you will always have something useful to do.

* Wizard: Prepare lots and lots of new spells every morning to fit the situation, which is overpowered and will make the DM hate you if you successfully predict what situations you'll be in. Also get a familiar for spying, and other ritual abilities. Enchanter school gets lots of neat mind control tricks. Unfortunately squishy, but I'm sure you'll find a nice ogre bodyguard to mind control.

* Warlock: Be creepy and recover your spells on a short rest. When your more subtle options fail you, you'll want *eldritch blast* and the agonizing blast invocation. Fey patron is great at mind control. Lackluster in short adventuring days.

Choose whatever race you find interesting. A bonus to your class's casting ability score is also good to have.

> Also if so can I make an item like lets say a mask that reduced WIS and controls someone mind?

Ask your DM.

> ALSO ALSO If so what spells could I cast and could I cast with little to no prep/effort?

Whatever spells your class gives you. Depending on class, I'd start with *friends*, *minor illusion*, *vicious mockery*, *ray of frost*, *charm person*, *sleep*, *suggestion*, *hold person*, and *invisibility*."
1,"* Spare the Dying: Do not get, get a healer's kit instead, it does the same thing.

* Guidance: You're probably not using your cantrips for combat. This is great utility out of combat, the rogue won't want to do anything without it.

* Toll the Dead (XGTE): You should have one ranged cantrip as a back-up. This one targets Wisdom and has high damage.

* Healing Word: The perfect healing spell for a cleric who doesn't want to heal. Use a bonus action to put a 0 HP ally on their feet, then use your action to smack whatever dropped them.

* Shield Of Faith: Use on yourself to get your AC really high. A forge cleric in fullplate with a shield and the +1 domain bonus to AC can get 23 AC. The high AC makes it easier to maintain concentration on it. Also a bonus action, and decent duration. Best used in chokepoints or scenarios where you are certain the enemy can't ignore you and attack your allies.

* Spiritual Weapon: Who needs dual-wielding? Bonus action to cast, bonus action to attack with it, does not require concentration!! Good for when you need to kill something fast.

* Bless: Good offensive buff if you have several allies that rely on accuracy, like a rogue or warlock or fighter. You can use it on yourself too! +2.5 to hit on average is great."
1,Is this for a PC or NPC?
1,"> So how would a necromancer be with the heavy armor feat?

Heavy armor is coveted by arcane spellcasters, as it pushes them from mage armor (13 AC) to fullplate (18 AC). Mountain dwarf and githyanki are one feat away. A 1-level cleric dip is also an option, which comes with some utility and healing at the cost of not getting your highest-level spells every other level.

Cleric necromancers don't need to take the feat because they can get heavy armor from their domain.

> I notice the average spell casting feats but didn’t know how others would work is the thing. Also as a DM would you allow undead to be used to speed up building structures?

Why not? They'd need close supervision, of course. They are *monsters*.

> Also as a necromancer would you allow harvesting parts from your fallen undead after battle for new undead?

Being poisoned is also a condition, and it seems that this is not the actual effect of the substance. I would say ""drugged"".

I would also make it explicitly an ingested poison, DC 12 save-or-incapacitated is way too strong to just blow in someone's face.

> The poisoned target is incapacitated while it hallucinates.

I might also give it some supernatural effect. Myconids are supposed to have a shared dream-state going on, so it would make sense for them to have telepathic contact with everyone else under the same effect in a 10-mile radius or something.

1,"The setup I go with is this. It's a little low-fantasy, but the motivations and economics make sense.

* There are no mage colleges, all libraries with arcane knowledge are privately owned or have since been looted. There were back in the Golden Age of that old empire that left a lot of treasure-filled monster-infested ruins and ancient technology around the realm, but not these days. Magical secrets can be used to kill, and they can be used to kill *you*, so you don't share them with anyone who asks.

* Master-apprentice system is considered the safest way to teach magic. Keep an eye on the apprentice for years, make sure they're not a sociopath or planning to backstab you. There are *circles* of mages, but they're loosely held together and quite paranoid. More like pen pals than a club.

* Mages, as a rule, don't get involved in the military. It's bad for business. Even mercenary work is frowned upon. People are already scared of mages, we don't need to give them more reasons to try burning us at the stake. People won't pay you to fix their problems if they think you're a witch. Getting involved in the military is serious enough that several other mages may get together and assassinate you.

* You might get brought on as a court wizard. Check for poisons, perform divinations, make healing elixirs, detect and counter other magical influence on the court. They'll probably also want you to turn lead into gold, so watch out for that. That's fine, and lucrative, and generally an ideal career goal.

* When a mage ignores all these rules, they typically become a powerful dark lord because of how much of a game-changer magic is in a military context. The best strategy for a dark lord is to kill every other mage in the realm so that they can't plot the dark lord's downfall, they are the dark lord's most dangerous foes. This makes mages adhere even more strongly to the above rules.

* The other type of mage is a cultist. Also bad news, because blood magic and fiendish magic work and are effective.

* EDIT: The optimistic end-goal for a not-evil-dark-lord is to set up a circle of trusted powerful mages, apply pressure to the nobility (some members of the circle might be nobility themselves), and end war and hunger across the realm and usher in a new Golden Age. This is known as a ""Circle of Eight"" scenario. In this setup, the biggest danger is that members of the circle are killed or betray the rest of the circle to seize power, which is *also known as a ""Circle of Eight"" scenario*."

1,"I would say no. 100% of the class powers can be explained as Outsider magic, including mundane stuff like rogue and fighter powers (even in-game you spent runes on martial prowess and acrobatics), and the setting easily has room for flashy explosive or blasty powers (though those might use technological or alchemical devices as spell focuses). A class like the Artificer would be right at home in the setting (complete with a creepy homunculus that you built in a fuge state and you're not sure whether it is sentient). I would *strongly encourage* players to come up with creepy grimdark fluff for their class abilities, like barbarians getting stronger when they drink blood, or the rogue never being able to win at a game of chance ever since he was the sole survivor of a sadistic game of Russian Roulette.

The real question you should be asking is whether the PCs got their powers from the Outsider individually, or whether they got them second-hand like the Brigmore Witches or Daud's Whalers. You should also consider what strata of society they belong to, whether they come from different social classes, and what's making them work together. Perhaps they have powers that only work when three or more of them are within a city block of each other? Perhaps they could sever body parts, willingly or not, to get around this limitation...

You should also read up on non-Dunwall locations. Places like [unguarded Tyvian labor camps](https://dishonored.fandom.com/wiki/Prisons_of_the_Isles) or [newly established colonies on the unexplored continent of Pandyssia](https://dishonored.fandom.com/wiki/Pandyssian_Continent) could make for interesting settings.

What you might want to introduce is a level limit. Something like E6 would fit with the power level of the Dishonored universe. Even the PCs can't get beyond that, and it sets the power scale for the opponents they'll be facing.

And, of course, you'll want to limit the availability of spellcasting services, spell scrols, etc etc. But you could always track down a witch and do some favors to bring your friend back from the dead...

It's very easy to over-prepare. No more than five rooms of dungeon. No more than three bullet points per Person, Place, or Thing. You can improvise the rest, or take a 10-minute break during the session to think something up.

> the main characters (MCs) are recruits/volunteers/forced to enter the military and are en route to a planet. They are told that they have to put down hostile uprisings, and that this planet had illegally imported dragons. Otherwise, thats all they know. They are summoned (the whole army) to the assembly area, but their door is stuck and they have to either get out or wait for some time etc. which allows them to avoid getting slaughtered with the other military members by chemical warfare. This is actually an attempt by a rebel organization to stop the colonization and slaughter of the natives to the planet and imprisonment of the dragons to be used for military purposes or sold to the highest bidder. The MCs don't know that, but they might discover some along the way. Then landing happens, and they have to try to land it in one piece. But now that they're on the planet, I'm not sure what to do. 

Tell the players during character creation that they're starting out as conscripts in the Imperial Legion, and that they were not given a choice in the matter. Standard Roman Empire strategy, conquered tribes are conscripted and shipped off to conquer other planets. Work that into everybody's background. ""What are you going to do when you've served your ten years (cryo-sleep years do not count) and have citizenship?"" ""What did you love most that the Empire took from you?""

I might throw a little equipment failure into the start. Make it obvious that there was an collision, or enemy action, and some kind of hull breach. Having to find a leak and patch it so you don't suffocate could be a good team-building activity.

I would also give them a political officer to breathe down their necks. Since you're running sci-fi, you could give them all fancy explosive collars or just advanced military gear. This gear would have an onboard AI watching them, recording them, relaying orders, answering questions about Imperial law and military protocol, etc etc. It will 1) tell them their mission parameters, 2) express disapproval when they ignore their mission and remind them about pending disciplinary action, and 3) complain loudly if they are about to do anything directly harmful to Imperial citizens or property and it explodes if they actually do it."

Also meet with anybody who is rich or owns land, talk with them about how you're reducing their taxes compared to the last guy and also paying above market rates if they sell materiel to you. This is a careful balancing act, you can easily run out of money doing this. Maybe this is why you go adventuring, to get enough treasure and loot to fund this kind of popular campaign.

Find good lieutenants to manage all the details and boring stuff for you. Keep correspondence with them frequently, even while adventuring. Have a full-time courier on staff if you have to, or use *sending*. Make sure any problems are dealt with, you need to demonstrate competence at running your government.

^(""When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block."")

I'm going to guess that you are a level 1 fighter with 16 Strength, for the sake of example.

As a level 1 fighter with 16 Strength, you have a +2 proficiency bonus and a +3 Strength modifier. This totals +5. You roll a d20, add +5 to the result, and that's your to-hit roll. Your d20+5 roll is compared to your target's Armor Class.

^(""When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier--the same modifier used for the attack roll--to the damage."")

When you hit, your handaxe does d6 damage, and you add your Strength modifier to that damage roll, so you do 1d6+3 damage.

But fighters are known for dealing more damage than any other class at high levels (especially if they get their hands on a *flametongue longsword*).

I'd make sure your setting has a few orders of undead-slayers or dragon-slayers who devote a lot of resources towards tracking down these weapons and destroying them.

Also, the gods would also be aware every time one of their followers dies without moving to the afterlife. Every time a PC kills someone with the weapon, I'd mobilize one crusader from the same religion with a quest directly from their deity."
1,"""1 cubic foot"" is used frequently, so most DMs would agree that's the limit of the spell.

Thinning that volume out to cover a flat surface? Sounds sketchy. Most DMs would probably rule that on an object larger than a cubic foot, you can only make a mark or color 1 square foot in surface area. But if you want the mark to be rectangular, that's a gray area and really up to what your DM will allow. I can't think of a way to abuse it, so I'd allow it."

Skill proficiencies can be quite useful in 5e. I'd make Intelligence only grant language, tool, instrument, and vehicle proficiencies."

1,"I mostly disagree, but it's good to be critical of 5e D&D. It has some serious flaws.

> The first and biggest problem I have with 5e is Dexterity, it's too good of a stat.

Heavy armor is objectively better than light and medium armor to compensate for Dexterity being so good, to the point that heavy armor is coveted by spellcasters. I'm considering a mountain dwarf or githyanki wizard just so I can wear fullplate and other heavy armors starting at 4th level when I can spend a feat on it. The tradeoff with heavy armor is that it's expensive.

Do the math, a fighter in fullplate has 18 AC, while a rogue in studded leather with 20 Dexterity has 17 AC. You can get higher AC with shields, feats, combat styles, and magic items, but most of those AC bonuses work for all kinds of armor, so heavy armor remains the superior defensive option. The only comparable AC is a monk with 18 Dexterity and 18 Wisdom (which is nigh-impossible to achieve at low levels and restricts you to the usual monk equipment trade-offs).

> Second problem is with Intelligence. Don't get me wrong, I love the bounded accuracy system of 5e and think that ita pros outweigh the con, but Intelligence used to be the stat that governed proficiency in skills, and now? It just gives you one semi common skill, Investigation, and some very situational ones, unless you're a Wizard, of course. The reason I'm so impatiently waiting for Artificer and Mystic to become official is to have another use for this poor, poor stat

Yes, Intelligence is awful in 5e. Warlocks should have been Intelligence-based. I am looking forward to Artificer and Mystic.

I house-rule that Warlocks can be Intelligence-based if they want to be, and Intelligence is used for initiative rolls instead of Dexterity.

> Then let's talk about meta magic. Meta magic is one of those things that makes magic really fun, as you can bend a spell to your will to suit the needs of the situation. In older editions to bend a spell you needed to up cast it first, but in 5e not only metamagic is tied to one class and a weak one at that, but it's also tied to a resource separate to spell slots. In my opinion, the former was a bad idea, the Sorcerer class just deserved more. I think it would've been better to just give meta magic as part of the spellcasting feature, with Sorcerer and Wizard excelling at it, Cleric and Warlock still being capable with it, and Bard, Druid, Ranger and Paladin having very few options. On top of that, the Sorcerer should've had an entire set of unique features aside from meta magic

Metamagic was only a big deal in 3e, and it ended up producing some of the most broken combos on the character optimization forums. It was constantly included in splatbooks to give casters power creep faster than martials. I'm happy that it's limited to the sorcerer in 5e, it keeps a lid on spellcasters.

Sorcerers are not weak, they're stronger than any other class... but only at a handful of spells because of specific metamagic combos. Their weakness is lack of versatility, not lack of power. I do think that sorcerers should be getting more interesting bloodline abilities, and the current batch of official subclasses are all subpar. So the sorcerer *needs* metamagic because if any other class can get it, then there is no reason to play a sorcerer.

Bards have the opposite problem, nigh-infinite versatility but subpar power (which is the bard's thing, so they're fine). And druids and clerics are still CoDzilla in 5e. They do *not* need more magic. The warlock's problem is not game balance, it's that they only pull their weight if the party gets two short rests in the adventuring day (maybe give them +1 spell slot starting at 4th level if you're not planning to run 4-6 encounters per day?) I don't think that metamagic is needed for paladin, as paladins are quite the popular class thanks to their smite ability. The ranger... yeah the ranger needs something and that something could be more spellcasting.

I would allow a homebrew feat like Martial Adept, but granting one metamagic ability and 2 sorcery points, and you can convert slots into sorcery points but *not* sorcery points into slots. Take a feat for subtle spell or twin spell if you want it so badly.

I have also seen an interesting houserule to allow sorcerers to use any metamagic ability they haven't chosen, but at twice the sorcery point cost, to represent that they're effortlessly able to wield magic and make it do what they want it to. This could go a long way towards helping the sorcerer's versatility.

Another straightforward house rule is to give sorcerers the spell point variant from the DMG. Ditch the spell slots and font of power stuff, make spells all be points-based to sorcerers. It would cement their role as ""nova"" casters who can drop a lot of high-level slots all at once.

> Then we have the Paladin, which is not bound to a deithy anymore. Why? Where does their power come from then? Does the magical world of D&D work in such a way that you can say ""I will protect the innocent!"" and gain divine powers?

Even older editions acknowledged druids and clerics who were bound to ideals instead of deities.

Yes, the whole point of the paladin class is that you can swear an oath to protect the innocent and then gain divine powers."
1,You could probably run it easily using core 5e D&D rules (with maybe some gritty rule variants). The setting already supports dragons and powerful sorcerers. A Witcher is just a eldritch knight fighter or hunter ranger (and maybe a little multiclassing or feats to get the exact abilities you want).

Anyways, I'd let them get something like a tool proficiency instead."
1,"Yes, spellcasters do run into this issue worse than every other class. I recommend sorcerers and warlocks to newbies because they get less spells to worry about.

Spells simply do not fit on your character sheet. You write on the back or on a separate sheet of paper or use those fancy spell cards.

My system as a caster is to skim every spell available to my PC and write some quick notes on what each spell does, with special care taken to note casting time, range, duration, and saving throws (or spell attacks or automatic hits). I declare what the spell does based on my notes, the DM either lets that happen or stops to look it up to make sure I got it right, and the game goes on.

You might also find it helpful to use character optimization guides, which will categorize the best spells and the ~~worst~~most situational spells so you can narrow your options."
1,"Monsters don't have to follow PC rules. In fact, if they do use PC class rules they tend to be too strong offensively because of how long rest abilities are balanced. For example, *guiding bolt* and *magic missile* can one-shot 1st-level characters.

Do you feel a sense of dread whenever you consider the ravening monsters beyond civilization that could kill you in an instant because you have no supernatural abilities to speak of? Are you willing to get awesome elemental powers (see terms and conditions) in exchange for vague promises of leadership positions in the new world order that will result after we summon godlike beings into the realm?"""

1,"> I'm currently trying to figure out a magic system, more specifically how magic is used. I know this isn't exactly adhering to DnD rules, but I'm thinking of implementing power modifiers to spells based on where players are, because in this world there are magical currents in air and wind. ie, your spells will be more powerful out at sea, or in a forest, where magic power is at its densest, but your magic will be weaker in a cave where the air is stale, or at the summit of a mountain where the magic in the air is thin. Think magic ~ oxygen.

Wild magic zones, altered magic zones, and manifest zones are all in D&D canon. I would let the players know before character creation about this, and whenever they encounter such a zone tell their players that they can feel something is off (though they may need to roll Arcana checks or experiment to figure out exactly what the zone's properties are).

I would also encourage you to come up with things in these zones that you don't have to be a mage to appreciate. Floating rocks, anything metal moving more than 35 feet per second is struck by lightning, fire melts rock, etc etc.

1,"Aarakocra is generally considered broken on account of the 60-foot move speed (nevermind the flying), unless the DM adds in houserules like requiring room for 15-foot wingspans.

Aven from Plane Shift: Amonkhet are more balanced, check those out. They have medium/heavy armor restrictions because it makes sense, not to balance anything (because Dexterity-based builds in 5e are pretty good).

With any flying race, the primary balance concern is flying above an enemy who has no ranged attacks, while the non-flying members of the party sit back and don't draw that enemy's attention, and raining arrows down on that enemy until they die. This kills anything on open ground with no cover and no ranged attacks of its own, but that's a rare scenario in dungeons (because ceilings and because your allies will draw aggro in close quarters) so it's usually not an issue. Even dumb creatures can get behind cover or walk under a tree or walk around a corner to negate the flying advantage. There is also the scenario of the aven flying over a room with pressure plate traps to flip a switch to disable the traps, or flying over a chasm to tie off a rope when the DM forgot that one of the PCs could fly, which are again rare scenarios and really the DM ought to be putting those in on purpose to make the aven player feel smart.

1,"> Hi everybody, I wanted some extra opinions on a topic. I am currently playing in a setting where there are just no spell scrolls or organized schools of magic for a wizard to learn new spells.

Have you talked to your DM about this? Wizards are supposed to be getting spells at about the same rate other PCs get magic items.

If your party isn't getting magic items then it's probably fine, since the fighter won't be able to action surge with a *flametongue longsword* and you won't be too overshadowed.

> What I am noticing is that wizard feels lacking. Lots of downside's you need to keep your spell book save preferably pay a premium to make a spare one. Low HP low AC (or pay the mage armor tax) no weapons to speak off.

Yeah, that's normal for squishy PCs. Stand near the back, keep *shield* prepared in case things go poorly. Communicate with the Big Dumb Fighter about screening enemies so you don't get killed. If you're up against enemies with ranged attacks, use cover, even if you have to duck around corners.

> When comparing this to other full casters it feels like a very lack luster thing(not going into subclasses here).

Your power as a wizard is *preparation*, not turning into a bear or burning everything in the room (but some days you can do both). If you can successfully predict only two utility spells (out of your 6+) that are useful in the adventuring day, you will be pulling your weight in the party. Because of ritual casting you can sometimes do it without spending any spell slots.

Also, wizards get *find familiar*, their hidden class feature. Use it aggressively to scout and Help in combat, and make sure you have 50 gp of components to re-summon it at all times (and you can ritual cast it which requires no slot). If an enemy wastes an attack to swat your owl, you're doing your job.

> Am I missing something about the wizard because for me it feels like a lot of downside's without many upsides. Normally the upside of a wizard would be the ability to build a spell book and to use lots of different scrolls. Leading them to be very versatile.

I should point out that even in Star Wars canon, each Jedi specialized. Yoda doesn't even own a lightsaber but is considered one of the greatest masters of all time because of his wisdom and foresight (ignore the prequels *cough cough*), Vader has mastery of telekinesis and is a terrifying heavily armored warrior, Palpatine is a schemer with so much power that he can discards the subtlety you usually see in force-users and just throws lightning bolts around.

So, what do you specialize in?

For a generic Obi-Wan Kenobi build, I think a monk/cleric (kensai/arcana) would fit best. Monk is only necessary because of the ""unarmored samurai with supernatural reflexes"" archetype (and kensai fills that role well with an AC bonus). Cleric covers nearly all of the supernatural powers you need like mind control and healing, and the only thing missing is telekinesis which you can pick up with Arcana domain, and clerics do great in melee. If you're wearing any armor you can drop the monk levels and go straight cleric."

What feats in particular are you thinking of taking? Are they critical to your build? Are they worth a 5% better chance for an enemy to fail a saving throw? Some feats might be. Some feats might not.

This kind of stuff is not uncommon in science fiction. like this. You go for something like Wildstar or Mass Effect or Star Wars or Destiny or Warhammer 40K, where supernatural elements are so deeply ingrained into the setting that nobody questions it. If you say a villain is a space witch then they definitely are a space witch. The main questions you should start with are 1: how common is the supernatural? (mythical Jedi religion <-> ""telepath"" is a standard crew position), and 2: how grimdark is the setting?

I've run 5e D&D games doing scifi.

Here are the rules for skinning:

&#x200B;

\- Requires an intact carcass

&#x200B;

\- Requires an hour of work

&#x200B;

\- Requires a successful DC 15 Dex (Sleight of Hand) or Wisdom (Survival) check to preserve it in top condition

&#x200B;

\- Of a failed check, the hide doesn't meet the merchant's standards but can still be sold for a lesser price"
2,"Looking for feedback/opinions/advice with an encounter I’m building.

The setting is a bog. The goal is to pick a number of flowers which only grow in this location.

There are two terrain types:

1. Submerged- wet terrain which acts as difficult terrain and each square stepped into has a % chance of being quicksand.

2. Islands there are small islands throughout the bog on which the flowers grow. Each island square stepped on has a % chance of shooting a jet of fire.

My concerns are whether this is too difficult/deadly or if it sounds tedious and boring."
2,"I’ve seen a lot of reports of people playing clerics and/or Paladins and having their holy symbol/casting focus as a device on their shield.

Anyone know if this get around is explicitly allowed in the rules?"

2,"No, there is not a Pirate class. There is however a variation of the Sailor Background which is Pirate. Additionally, there is the Smuggler Background in the Ghosts of Saltmarsh book.

In the classes, the closest thing is probably the Rogue Swashbuckler archetype."

2,Save vs poison or be poisoned for x amount of time.
2,"The reason “D&D” might be used as a generic term for all RPGs is because it’s the original RPG, it’s pretty much the first RPG and certainly the most widespread one.

Kinda like “Kleenex” for all facial tissue or “Xerox” for all photocopies or “Coke” for all soda (if you’re from the South)."

2,"Regarding Edit 2

This doesn’t sound silly in the least. An experience like that can be real and actual trauma. Being placed in a situation like that, even a make believe one can be a trigger for something like this.

You might want to bring this up to your DM. “I just don’t like it” is way WAY different than “what you’re putting in the game is a real trigger for my real and actual history of trauma.”

Given that this is the case, your DM should not subject you to this."

2,"There’s no rule that says every character has to be optimized in order to be effective.

You should play what’s fun.

Playing an non-optimized character is only going to be a “hindrance” to the party if you do something dumb like dump the stats important to the class or possibly if the entire play style of your group is all about optimized characters."
2,"Ghosts not knowing they’re ghosts is a pretty common idea. One idea behind ghosts is that people are stuck here, thinking they have to complete some task or other and they don’t know they’re dead.

2,"Or, how careless everyone is with their emotions. In a place fueled by emotion, it ought to be necessary to be mindful to some degree of how you throw your emotions around. In the PM, there’s probably far less consequence to being carelessly emotional."
2,"It ain't called ""Dungeons & *Dragons*"" for nothing, bud."
2,"Several possibilities:

- Your DM doesn’t know how to properly balance encounters

- Your DM is adversarial and a cheater and plays a “DM vs Players” game

- You, the players don’t know what you’re doing and make poor choices consistently

- Bad luck, players constantly rolling poorly, DM constantly rolling well

Whatever the case, communication is key."
2,Have a downvote. Because rogues.
2,"I recommend that if you’re new, don’t allow it. Just be honest and say that because you’re new you’d rather not have to deal with anything that deviates that far from the rules because you don’t know how to balance it.

And stick to that decision."
2,"Can they “win” by means other than beating the final boss or are you just trying to predetermine that the grand finale of the game is “you lose?”

If it’s the latter; then no, it’s not fair."
2,Make the areas more different
2,Carve your own out of the bones of your enemies like a real gamer.

2,"“Glatness Cube”

2,"Whatever you do, it’s gotta be about controlling their movement. Divide them, corral them, and rain hot death down upon them.

Pour oil in them from the rooftops and then toss fire on them."
2,Are they right though?
2,Create a custom soundboard with a bunch of prerecorded quotes that you’ve heard already
2,"Yeah, you would have does at lvl 1 when that goblin from the meaningless random encounter critted you, but your DM was like “nah, let ‘em get to the dungeon at least before anyone really has a chance of dying,” so they just had the gobo do regular damage."
2,Not clear on what the pendants are or why they’d be necessary.

2,Regular folks in the hamlet are probably already making their own soap by boiling fats with ash.

2,I think the mechanics of wild magic are an adequate reason why you might be kicked out.
2,It would definitely annoy everyone. Trying to do a multiple personality character usually gets old really fast.

2,"They’re not really *different* though; not in the way you’re trying to get them to be by being non-human. Variant humans are still just human, they’re only *variant* in a mechanical sense.

2,Isn’t there like only 30 people in the whole state?
2,This makes no sense.
2,There was someone in the chat for this subreddit recently who was very new to D&D and kept causing confusion because they kept using the term “DM” to refer to direct messaging rather than dungeon master.
2,"I would also like to say that telling a player “no” isn’t rude. 

As DM, it’s your job to be the referee and part of that is maintaining game balance. If you allow one player to have a bunch of extra stuff and not others, then you’re not being fair to the other players unless you also allow them to have extra stuff. 

And then what happens to game balance? You’re supposed to do a bunch of extra work to rebalance the *entire game* because some player can’t enjoy the game unless they get to play one particular character concept? Now who’s being rude?"
2,"In D&D, a player doesn’t normally have access to this kind of stuff simply because they want it; the game just doesn’t work like that and never has.

Just explain this to the player. You’re sorry, but there are rules concerning what powers and equipment a character is allowed to start with.

While the phrase “you can do whatever you want in D&D” is bandied about quite frequently, it’s not exactly true, there are parameters to what you can do."
2,"Oh, I see...I guess I was confused by the part where you said ""i've got a Pseudodragon *familiar,""* my bad."
2,All of the Strawberry Shortcake characters.
2,So work it into the story. Take whatever necessary tropes there are to make magical anime girls work and weave them into your story.
2,"It’s a familiar, which means it’s really a spirit in the form of a pseudodragon and if it dies, you can just re-summon it again."
2,"Father was a locksmith who died of violence/plague/whatever. Perhaps a very skilled one who was able to create special locks for the Noble who adopted her.

Or, perhaps the Noble and the Locksmith were adventurers together. The Locksmith had been a rogue and the Noble was a paladin or fighter or something and the reason he adopted her was because he owed his life to the rogue/locksmith."
2,"He is a minion of Zuggtmoy, the demon lord of fungi. He wants to infect the dragons because they’d make powerful additions to her army."
2,"The Evil Organization captures Our Heroes and threatens the kill them, and so the ""heroes"" get butthurt and want to walk away.

Sorry dude, but so far, you haven't painted a picture of a controlling GM, you've painted one of a bunch of players who are pussies."
2,"I’ve seen inspiration tokens and game terrain items (buildings, etc)."
2,"No it’s not fair, why would you do that?"
2,How does the rest of the party know that the rogue got this money?
2,There is a celestial warlock. Nothing so specific as sun god tho.
2,"Since there aren’t “magic points” of any kind, this would be difficult to do without completely overhauling the magic system; and then for what?"
2,"You want to become villains because you’re not getting enough praise from the public? What a bunch of weak-ass, noncommittal fake heroes you are."
2,Not really sure what your question actually is.
2,"You're right. DMG p 128 says a fortified tower takes 100 days to construct at a cost of 15,000 gp \[does not state the dimensions of the structure\]."
2,"Season 2 is taking forever to get through, so I doubt I'll bother with Season 1. I don't need to ""force myself"" to get through it."
2,"Just be honest and tell them why your'e doing it - it's starting to imbalance the game. Maybe it sucks for those who haven't earned the items, but hey."
2,You could simply rule that used items can’t be passed down.
2,"I started listening with campaign 2. I tried to start with 1, but the sound quality of the earliest episode was unacceptably low for me, so I skipped to the second one. It’s totally different characters."
2,Will take longer than a year to build a tower by non-magical means.
2,“Will not” is very definitive language.
2,"You’re the DM, the animal is an NPC, it does what you say it does. Maybe it just likes the Druid better. 

Also: social rolls are not mind control."
2,"Maybe create some environmental thing which allows the players to jump up and attack?

Give them something to throw or shoot?

Remind them that specialization sacrifices utility and they knew the job was dangerous when they took it.

[Important side note: it’s an unrealistic expectation on the part of the players to expect that every encounter plays to their strengths. D&D has *always* been about problem solving.]"

2,"Sounds like vastly incompatible play styles. Your SO, probably shouldn’t play in this DM’s game."
2,"Yeah, that's the thing...hexblade and sword bard might be a good mechanically viable multiclass, but it really doesn't fit the character concept I'm going for here."
2,"Thank for the response. But, given that I want the character to be music-focused from a flavor perspective, I think hexblade and sword bard make the least sense."
2,"Creature parts

Regular stuff that’s been smuggled in to avoid taxes

Also: keep in mind that the “black market” isn’t usually a place, it’s more of a network."
2,"Sounds like they’re used to playing computer games.

That said, if they want to do this, then they should play it very carefully.

I don’t see any real reason why you shouldn’t let them or hand hold them at all. If players knowingly choose to go up against superior foes, then that’s on them. If they try to take on a goblin village and die, then maybe their next characters will make better choices."
2,"What if all the Crown Jewels, crown included are like little parts that all Voltron together to make the Final Form of the sovereign."
2,"I believe this is the premise of the new WoTC release “Baldur’s Gate:Descent into Avernus,” except that adventure is meant to go from lvl 1 - 13."
2,"Whatever you do (and I agree with the droid or ranger choice mentioned elsewhere), I think it’s important to stress the fact that because this is *level 2*, they shouldn’t expect their character to be able to do all the cool stuff that the Adventure Time character can (the standard problem of trying to base your D&D character off something that’s not from D&D).

Note: this isn’t meant as “no, you can’t do that,” but it’s just that lvl 2 characters aren’t powerful in D&D, and often, when people want to base characters on things from outside the game what they like is all the powers of those things, and they don’t understand that being a low lvl character in D&D means that you’re really not that powerful *yet*."
2,"If you consider that the Tarrasque is basically D&D’s Godzilla, what about creating something similar? Just like Godzilla has his arch-enemy Ghidora, perhaps the Tarrasque also has an arch enemy legendary creature."
2,"I don’t suggest making a low charisma bard, that sort of character is known as a “waste of space.”"
2,I like that you’re using graph paper. Gives it that old school D&D feel.
2,What if the Crown Jewels are a set of artifacts which enhance the Crown’s powers.
2,You could absolutely tell stories in AD&D. A lot of wizards just had very short stories.
2,"Yes. Wizards are fragile. This is why they’re often referred to as “glass cannons.”

It was worse in AD&D, though when they had a d4 hit die instead of the generous d6 they now have in 5e (and you didn’t get max hp at lvl 1 - you could literally start the game with 1hp)."
2,"Typically, the way it works in the average game is that during play, the only person who has access to the Monster Manual is the DM."
2,For the exact same reason he wrote season when he meant to write session - people make mistakes. Mine was assuming the person meant what they wrote.
2,"Yes, always go off what the book says. If there’s a disagreement between some website and the book, the book is always right (unless the website is the official errata of the book)."
2,Just...don’t...metagame?
2,Do you even know how to make sense?
2,"Yeah, it says “season” not “session.” Had the person said what they meant, I wouldn’t have misunderstood. Normally, you don’t jump down someone’s throat when they misunderstand you because you made a mistake."
2,"Oh, I see. You wrote “season” not “session,” so I thought you meant the campaign."
2,I’m not quite sure why you think I’m being salty to *you*. You don’t have any other comments in this thread.
2,"Looking up monsters in the MM while playing? Why would you allow that? Players aren’t supposed to do that. You’re the DM, you’re the referee.

Player: picks up MM to look up monster.

DM: “Excuse me, what are you doing?”

Player: “Uh...looking it up.”

DM: “No.”"
2,Without taking a single point of damage? Over a series of game sessions? Sounds like bullshit or favoritism to me.
2,Lazy
2,"Have you renamed Le Baron in your campaign or does Christianity exist in it? The only reason Baron Samedi is named so is because Saturday is the only day on which Jesus was dead (killed on a Friday, resurrected on the following Sunday)."
2,"Consequences consequences consequences.

If you’re in a town and they kill random npcs, then have there be witnesses. It’s a town for freak’s sake. They don’t get to have privacy when they want it for the sake of killing innocents. If they’re in a shop and want to kill the shop owner, there ought to be people around. And one will always be able to run away and get the town guard."

2,"The way metal typically works in the real world is that when it’s harder and lighter, it’s usually more rigid, so mithral wire might not be plausible at all.

(Yes, yes, I know “BuT fAnTaSy”)"
2,"If the god of lightning “goes away” does lightning still exist?

Are gods just filling temporary bureaucratic positions or are they tied to the forces they represent?

If the god of lightning abandons their post, are they still the god of lightning?

Is it the god of lightning who empowers a cleric or the forces they represent which does so?"
2,"This is shitty DMing.

Your DM is trying to tell a story rather than play a game and is railroading everything hard in order to make sure that story gets told."
2,"Since it’s 100% up to your DM whether gods can be killed or not, you might want to talk to them."
2,Magic wand that’s out of charges.
2,"Different things. Sometimes I base a name on a character concept, sometimes I get an idea for a name and build a character off that.

Sometimes I’ll use fantasy name generator (either outright or for inspiration), other times I might use names from rl cultures which have the flavor of that character I want. 

Sometimes, I’ll use some language translator to translate a word or two which describe the character and make a name out of that."
2,Who’s the patron?
2,“But I wanna”
2,"Considering that slimes/slime molds are similar to fungi, perhaps Zuggtmoy?"
2,"If you want to make the character really ooze-like, give it the sort of ability that a lot of oozes do, where they can move through openings which would normally be too small for them."
2,"So, was the death handwaived away or do you actually have to make a different character?"
2,"What do you want man, the version I’m presenting is the actual rules of the game. The version you’re pissed off at is just some house rule stuff."
2,"If you’re going to go wizard, then pick a race that gives you a bonus to Int - Elf, Gnome, some such (High Elf and Forest Gnome will each give you an additional cantrip as well). If you’re going to go Sorcerer, pick a race that gives you a bonus to Cha - Dragonborn, Tiefling, or Half-Elf."
2,"What was the DM rolling for? Social interactions work like this: you make a roll with a DC based on the NPC’s attitude towards you; they’re not contested rolls.

So, the DM shouldn’t have rolled at all, and your 18 might have been successful depending on the DC."
2,Isn’t session 0 generally devoid of playing? It’s supposed to be about setting up expectations and making characters and all that
2,"It might make sense at early levels, but once you get beyond tier 1, this would make a lot less sense"

Some potential ideas:

Just let them start multiclassing as warlock with no loss of anything - if ever there was a good rp reason to multiclass into warlock this is it.

3,"We  all love our characters like our children, but there is always that one character we regret creating, they might spund fun or great on paper but when we actually play them they disapoint us.

For me this was a character in my most recent campaign: Aarkon, a blue dragonborn storm barbarian/vengence paladin tank multiclass focused on grappling with the tavern brawler feat. On paper it was a great concept, grapple an enemy (or two)  and then hit them with smites (weapons and unarmed) and the storm aoe of the barbarian until they die. In reality it was way harder to get the damage of and when facing more then 2 enemies were attacking and out of combat the bard took the place of the parties face. Over all it was disapointing to play him and I kinda wished I did not create him as he only caused me frustration until his retirement.

Edit: I suck at grammar"
3,"Mine has to be my half-elf slizzard Aarkon, a bladesinger 5/ drunken fist monk 12 multiclass, started as bladesinger 2/monk 1. He attended wizard school because his father forced him to but spend most evenings drinking in taverns. One particular drunk night he witnesses a drunk halfling beat the crap out of a bunch of drunk dwarves in a bar fight and saved Aarkon's ass was really impressed by it. He wanted to know how he did it so the halfling took him to his monestary and taught him the way of the drunken fist. Since then Aarkon improved his wizard skills but focused more on his monk ways."
3,"My DM likes to make up some silly magic items and hand them to us players. Last session I got such a magic item: 

The Rock of Rolling, a 0,5 lbs spherical rock that can be activated via a command. When activ I can mentally controll it and have it roll around in a 120ft radius and know its location.

So now I am thinking of how to use this to my advantage. I thought about using it to activate traps in dungeons with it while standing back, but as an Arcane Trickster I could do the same with mage hand, or having light cast on it, but other then that I have no great ideas.

Edit: it can move 60ft per round, no LoS necesarry"
3,"Just as the titel says.

Mine was a wizard 3 (bladesinger)/ monk 14 (drunken fist). He was a failed wizard that after seeing a drunk guy beat fown several dudes in a barfight became a monk under that guys guidence. The combination of bladesong and the drunk swaying was really fun and the classes worked suprisingly well together. I only had some utility spells and mostly ritual spells but those were enough. It was really a blast to play this guy and I would love to play something similar again in the future.

Edit: by worst multiclass I mean a multiclass that shouldn't work at girst glance or only wotks under specific circumstances."

So what are your favorite scariest low CR monsters ?
3,"After our last session our DM gave us some downtime to prepare for a longer sea travel/island hopping segment of our campaign so I decided to sort out my inventory to see if I would need something specific for this adventure arc. Turns out that in almost 1,5 years of weekly sessions my Dragonborn Bloodhunter collected a bunch of weird and useless stuff including:

* a jar of hair (had to ask the group again where I got that, apparently I took it from a wizard to stop his scrying possibilities)

* 950 ft of rope (yeah I keep forgetting I have it and buy new ones)

* a goblin skull (my first kill)

*  a few dead animals for bait purpose (some are rotting according to the DM)

Check your inventory and tell me what you weird stuff you find in there!"

3,"I am currently DMing a homebrew campaign for a party of 6 that takes place in a world with 3 major island kingdoms on the verge of war. And an evil necromancer trying to take over the world behinde the sceens.

At the begining the group started trying to gain more influence in the biggest of the 3 kingdoms by sabotaging another kingdom they started in after they found a spy in said kingdom.

Now after a few sessions doing that and collecting powerful relics they met the necromancer for the first time, who is after the relics himself. Before the fight even began they the paladin demanded to know why he seeks out these relics. He replied that he is going to take over the world in order to stop this war with his undead army, so no more lifes will be lost.

And then the paladin says the one thing I did not expect: ""We should help him bring peace to these lands"" after some discussion and convincing the life ckeric that it is for the greater good they all joined the necromancer and are now looking for the rest of the relics. 

I love and hate my party for doing this and now I have to rewrite part of the campaign."
3,"Something crazy happened to me and my friend from work today. We went out for lunch as usual and were joined by our boss and some coworkers as the place where they usualy eat was closed. Me and my friend start talking about the events from yesterdays session when our boss looks at us and asks what we are talking about. After a brief explanation on DnD and some questions from our coeorkers he goes quiet for a moment thinking. He then goes: ""Sounds like a great way to establish teamwork, would you mind to play with your coworkes next month for the team building exercise?"" (We do team building exercises every month: escaperooms, scavanger hunts,... ). My friend agrees to DM and now I get to play DnD at work, great!"
3,We all know that clerics get certain benefits through their god/sugar daddy  and domain but faith is not something written in stone like a warlocks pact with his patron and me and my friend   thinking what would happen in game  if a cleric chose to follow another god or let's say he worships a multitude of gods. Could they change easily between domains like chainging clothes and what would possible reprecations by the gods be?
3,So a few months ago a friend of mine DMed a one-shot for our group where we just used the weirdest and worst characters we could create. That one-shot  turned into a full homebrew campaign by now and sadly my dualwielding kobold paladin died to unfortunate events and now I need a new bad character to fill in the spot. So hit me with your stupidly weird and bad characters!

3,"The rules on dual wielding are pretty clear, you need to have a light weapon in both your main and off-hand to be able to use a bonus action attack with your off hand. 

The restiction  on light weapons is taken away if you have the dualwielder feat, which let's you dualwield any weapon that does not have the two-handed property, because two-handed weapons are to big to effectively wield with one hand."
3,">Long Rest
>A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting Spells, or similar Adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

>At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost Hit Points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

>A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits."
3,"I alwys liked Weird, because you can take out so many creatures out of a fight."
3,"The re-roll was fine as like you said the ranger would have been unconcuous at that time. And this is also why you always should roll one hit after the other and eoll for sanage befor the next attack, because maybe after the 2nd hit landed on an unconcious target the bbeg would focus on the guy who is still standing instead of the guy bleedi g out on the floor in hopes of downing them both."
3,"Your character did not break the story, the DM did using your character."
3,"You only get the 2 attacks if you attack a  different target within 5ft of the first target, but you are tinking to small. As soon as you get Swift Quiver you get 2 additional attacks as a bonus action, which means you could possibly mean 8 attacks total between 2 targets."

In your drunken state you enlisted in the adventurers guild and took on the mission to close the portal that the cult opened, you are ""Plan Y"".

3,"He was once a beautiful man, in fact he was so beautiful a godess fell in love with him and he with her. This  angered the god of darkness who showed affection for said godess but was rejected by her. So he went down to the material plane and challenge the man to a fight for the heart of the godess. During this fight the god of darkness used a poisonous weapon and cut the man's cheek. The skin imediatly began to turn black and rot where he was cut because of the poison. The god laughed saying no women would ever love such a hideous face. At this point the godess showed up to interrupt the fight. She banished the god of darkness telling him she could never love a man with such a rotten personality and used her divine magic to stop the poison in the man's face, but the damage was already done. She told him that it would be better for them to part as other gods would come and challeng him. She gave him a mask as a fare well gift to hide his wound and left."

3,What most people forget is that every creature has to shit and preferably does not like to have the smell in their living space. So there should be a room or area in the dungeon where there is a lot of shit from all the inhabitants.
3,"As a DM you can certainly buff them if you want to, but then also buff the monsters as counter measurement. If you don't want to do that tell them you play by the rules as intended and don't feel comfortable breaking game balance and if they want to have overpowered characters they can look for a new DM that statisfies their playstyle, because there are a lot of players looking for people to DM for them."

They use pulleys to lower their ships down from the island onto the sea and pull them back up when needed. This makes the island not only a place for treasure hunters but also craftsmen and merchants as well. On the northern half a forest has been planted to supply wood for the ship makers. Most food and other resources get imported from other islands

Maybe talk to the player about being a cleric to the druid god as ""Champion of Nibbler"".

 If we go for the players initial idea, of course Nibbler would need to be okay of a guy fighting for his godhod, which could lead to some crazy cult forming that tries to grant Nibbler godhod and is against the current gods. Which would make the player more of a warlock then a cleric by class but not by name, but could turn out very interesting. I would go for it, even if you plan for Nibbler to not want to, maybe some other being is tricking the ""cleric"" into bringing down the gods."

>As written, the current version simply specifies that plating counts as armor, not that it counts specifically as heavy or medium armor. So in this version, a warforged barbarian can rage while in the heavy plating mode… though they will have to acquire the heavy armor proficiency before they can use heavy plating.

>The target assumes the Hit Points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of Hit Points it had before it transformed. **If it reverts as a result of Dropping to 0 Hit Points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form**. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 Hit Points, it isn't knocked Unconscious.

You could kill someone by dropping him in polymorph form."

The rogue with his mobile feat just dashes off as the guards surround us and I just sit there like ""Fuck what do I do"" and look through my spells. I had polymorph prepared to sneak in as a rat, but how could it help me now, surrounded by guards. Then I remembered something: owls have flyby, which means no AoO. Polymorphed into an owl and flew right out the closest window, on my way to  shit on the rogue."
3,">desperately short of a cleric

What exactly do you mean by that? Clerics are not heal bots, and war domain can do some serious damage. +10 to a guiding bolt to give allies advantage and kater giving them +10 to their attacks is great. Also the quicker you kill an enemy the less time he has to danage allued and you need less healing."

3,"From the Sage Advice Compendium:

>If you have spell slots, can you use them to cast the 1st level spell you learn with the Magic Initiate feat? Yes, but only if the class you pick for the feat is one of your classes. For example, if you pick sorcerer and you are a sorcerer, the Spellcasting feature for that class tells you that you can use your spell slots to cast the sorcerer spells you know, so you can use your spell slots to cast the 1st-level sorcerer spell you learn from Magic Initiate. Similarly, if you are a wizard and pick that class for the feat, you learn a 1st-level wizard spell, which you could add to your spellbook and subsequently prepare."

3,"Yes they can take the help action but why use it for that if the creatures can attack instead. Sure advantage is nice but you use your bonus action to command the creatures each turn or else they will just do what any sane creature of its species would do, which is probably run as soon as it sees some dangerous monster or kill each other if apropriate. Also you would have to give the same command to all creatures as you only have 1 bonus action, so 3 creatures would help the same guy in one turn instead of each one attacking. Remember this are still regular beasts with regular beast intelligence and not really capable of developing strategies by themselves."

The best villains aren't evil or vile, the best villains are actually right in what they try to achive, it's just that their ways aren't the nicest. If his goal is to save the planet having him do it by attacking and destroying cities to reclaim the land for nature without carrying  about the innocent peoples lives makes him already this kind of villain. Instead of  making it easy to hate him, make it so that he is kinda likable, carrying for animals that lost their parents to hunters, got wounded by them or who had to flee their home because their forest got burned down to make space for farmland. And while he carties for nature, he hates anyone living in cities and whi us not in touch with nature and is willing to erradicate them without second thought"

Whatever you decide to say, use it against the party who left you to die. Maybe talk to the DM about leaving your character alive in secret so that he might act out revenge on the party who left him to die."
3,Definetly War Caster first as it will help with concentration checks and with the adcantage and proficiency should be enough and you can use spells for attacks of opportunity. Next I would probably increase Dex to get better AC and saves as you are a squishy wizard and don't want to get hit.

3,Try talking to them and tell them that it feels like you have no say in what your character wants or can do. If he still ignores your player agency just do your own thing and when he gets mad about it and kills you leave and find a DM that cares for their players and not only for his prewritten story.

The pouch always weights 2 lbs no matter what is inside it. Any attemt to put an item in it that isn't a weapon, shield or piece of armor or when it is full results in the bag emtying itself and spitting out everything stored in it.

Iarno is fun villain/NPC because his evil identity is secret, and he's Sildar Hallwinter's contact (in the Lord's Alliance) out in Phandalin. The campaign book only briefly touches on this point, but it can be exciting to play up this relationship in big betrayal reveal.
 Here are a few ideas:

What if Sildar and Iarno are old friends? How does the betrayal affect Sildar?

What if Iarno is a double agent, trying to penetrate a drow slave trade operation?

What if Sildar is also a traitor and there's an evil master plan at work?

Basically, yes, subraces can interbreed, but the offspring have the traits of one of their parents rather than being a hybrid. The distinction between subraces is deeper than the distinction between ethnic groups, who have varying appearances but identical mechanical racial traits; subraces ""breed true"" rather than mixing in most circumstances. I'd be inclined to say a mixed subrace individual would appear to be one particular subrace, but could conceivably have a feature or two that hints at their more diverse heritage, say eye or hair colour. Mechnically, however, you just choose the subrace of one of the parents."

3,"I can agree with the part that a backstory that is essentially a novel and probably a campaign by itself is bad and unneccesary and probably noone else of the PC will care about it or care little and a paragraph or at max one A4 page is definetly enough of a backstory, but the DM should care about it as he needs the info to place the character and insert them in the story, which also makes it more interesting for the player. I've had the guy with ""no backstory at all I just kill things"" in a group before and it was a pain in the ass to have him be engaged in stugf other then killing the next random monster that crossed his path, he left because ""I am a shitty DM and don't work him into the story"" even though he gave me nothing to work with.

>A monster’s challenge rating tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.

Basically it gives you an idea how hard it will be for your party to deal with a threat. The EXP you get from a encounter is equal to the summ of the exp each monster in the encounter would give.

He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of Magic is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

Depending on how Charming and the druid interact with it it could prefer one over the other but still follow every group members commands with enough training and attention. Wolfs follow a hirarchy in their pack where the alpha wolf commands the group but they still listen to every group member and do what they think is best, and anyone can challenge the alpha if they think he does a bad job. So the druid could kick Charmings butt to assert dominance over him and the wolf would by instinct follow the new and stronger leader.

Keep the fighter 6/ barvarian 4 split to have max ASI/Feat. Since you are not relying on the unarmored defense a Con of 17 should be enough for decent saves, instead pump up Strenght to 20 with the 4th level barbarian ASI for better hit chance and damage.

 Next the 6th level ASI/feat the fighter gets, I would go with shield master feat as now you can add your shields AC to your dex saves and also use your reaction to nullify damage on a succesful save. The feat also allows you to push a creature you attack within 5ft of you prone or away from you. 

Last but not least the extra critical from champion is nice but I like the manuvers of the battlemaster as they allow you to controll the battle field better, like having allies move on your turn, disarm enemies, frighten them, ect.

The standard hunan is fine in that build as it helps you with your uneven stats. Hope my insight helped."

Edit: Also the 6th lavel ASI for the Fighter is missing."
3,What combination do I have to roll for a complete off the rails murderhobo campaign where nothing matters to the players and I rage quit by throwing a god version of myself at them and just completly anihalate them?
3,"Magic and adaptation over millions of years, but mostly magic."
3,">If a raven got turned into a kenku, what person would **pisses such power.**

Now I have the picture of a wizard urinating on a raven in my head, thanks a lot."
3,Who knows one day he might just hit the BBEG disguised as a kobold.
3,It comes down to balance and if it fits the setting. Level 20 characters are already close to demigods especially wizards. It'd be still be a little stange that any mortal character can advance to a lower level of godhod without followers or similat stuff.
3,"Mystic Arcanum is not using spellslots so no, you do not regain them."
3,And LN gets the best.
3,"I did some math on this before. At level 20 with the following magic items, a Tome of the Stilled Tongue and 2 × Pearls of Power you can get this:

Every day, you have the following spell slots you can use to make or control undead:

9th level: 1 + 1 from Arcane Recovery + 1 from Tome of the Stilled Tongue = 3

8th level: 1

7th level: 2

6th level: 2

5th level: 3

4th level: 3

3rd level: 3 + 1 from Signature Spell + 2 from Pearls of Power = 6

Day 1:

*3 × 9th level Create Undead = 6 mummies

* 1 × 8th level Create Undead = 2 wights

* 2 × 7th level Create Undead = 8 ghouls

* 2 × 6th level Create Undead = 6 ghouls

* 3 × 5th level Animate Dead = 18 skeletons

* 3 × 4th level Animate Dead = 12 skeletons

* 6 × 3rd level Animate Dead = 12 skeletons

Total: 6 mummies, 2 wights, 14 ghouls, 42 skeletons

Day 2:

* 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th level spell slots are used to reassert control over mummies, wights, and ghouls

* 6 × 3rd level spell slots and 3 × 4th level spell slots are used to reassert control over 42 skeletons

* 3 × 5th level spell slots are used to animate 24 skeletons

Total: 4 mummies, 2 wights, 14 ghouls, 66 skeletons

Day 3 and onwards:

* 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th level spell slots are used to reassert control over mummies, wights, and ghouls

* 6 × 3rd level spell slots, 3 × 4th level spell slots, and 3 × 5th level spell slots are used to reassert control over 66 skeletons

**Total: 4 mummies, 2 wights, 14 ghouls, 66 skeletons**"
3,"Got another one

Potion of undeath: This potion will kill you instantly when consumed but then raises you as an undead version of yourself. You keep all stats, bonuses and abilities from your previous form but now also count as undead. If used on an undead creature it will have the revrrse effect and restore their bodyback to the state before they died. It has no effect on a dead creature."
3,"Potion of Tounges: after drinking this potion you instantly can speak and understand the first language you hear like a nativ speaker, you however forget every other language you knew up to this point. Duration forever or until dispelled.

Potion of invisibility: this potion makes a creature it drinks invisible, buth just their body, not their clothes or other items they carry. Duration 1 hour and 23 minutes

Potion of coolness: this potion gives you advantage on persuasion and deception checks but you also deal 1d8 cold damage to anyone you touch. Duration  10 minutes"
3,"Definetly Zealot, not only do you get bonus damagr on your fitst hit every round at later levels you can't even be killed while raging."
3,There are tons just google d1000 wild magic table.
3,"The country of Benthos was founded by dwarves and gnomes alike and lies beneath the mountain chain of  Gradanax and consists of various underground cities conected through a series of caves. Some of the cities go up to the surface and are build into the mountain sides. They are known for their great smithing skills, rare ores and some impresive machinerie."
3,"Can you give us a brief summary of each of the states you already have, so that we not create the same as you already have."
3,So killing a 14th level PC (140.000 xp) is almost the same as killing a Tarrasque (155.000 xp)
3,"For cleric/druids, the CR is generally half the spell-casting level.

>Acolyte:

>Challenge: 1/4 ... a 1st-level spellcaster

>(The example provided is an unarmored acolyte, so the CR is lower that it would be for a cleric in typical armor.)

>Cult Fanatic:

>Challenge: 2 ... a 4th-lvel spellcaster



>Druid:

>Challenge: 2 ... a 4th-level spellcaster



>Priest:

>Challenge: 2 ... a 5th-level spellcaster

For mages, the CR is 2/3 the spellcasting level.

>Mage:

>Challenge 6 ... a 9th-level spellcaster



>Archmage:

>Challenge: 12 ... an 18th-level spellcaster



So look for creatures with a CR of 1/2  to 1/3 of the characters level to give apropriate xp."
3,"Yeah having access to spells like shield of faith, healing words, guiding bolt and inflict wounds sucks as a fragile caster. /s"
3,Make it similar to a dragonborns aoe breath where it is a 15-20ft cone with 1d8 damage or lower.
3,"El Drago, a black dragonborn bard wearing a chromatic rainbow mask. He favors close combat with his bare hands and uses spells to buff himself, scare enemies or hold them. He likes to put on a show and only speaks draconic when in the arena. Out side of it he is still full of energy but very kind hearted."
3,"Open hand is nice esoecially at later lavels when you can quivering palm the BBEG and he just dies, especially good with a diviner wizards potent ability."
3,"There is definetly a way with radiant damage  or something else. The real question if it is ethnical to eat the egg of a creature that is intelligenter then an average human, capable of speak and magic and probably knows more about anything then you do."
3,"Wizards are glass canons, you deal hogh damage per round but are very squishy. To avoid getting hit you normally should cast mage armor befor combat to increase your AC andd try to get magic items to increase it. You could possibly multiclass into a cleric domain that grants heavy armor proficiency."
3,"Lore Bard, pick Animate Dead as your 6th level Magical secrets and use the undead as background performers. You are the Necrodancer!"
3,Isn't it usually the higher you roll the closer you get to the goal you want to accomplish? Also was the warlock at level 1 with only 1 hp left and low max hp? Because by RAW you would need to get to negative of your max hp to get outright killed and throwing someone against a wall would probably only do 1d4+str mod as it would be an improved weapon attack.
3,It was his fault because he shouldn't have been within fireball range obviously. /s
3,"For myself it had to have been my barbarian, after fighting some bears and our cleric and only healer unconcious I took the iniciative and looked for something to heal him. I discovered a bee hive and from a decent nature check knew that it could be used to seal the clerics wounds, so I clined the tree to get it. I nabaged to get up but got attacked by the bees, while being in single diget health. Got killed by bees and a 35ft fall.

For all times ever probably the bard who tried to seduce the dragon. He succeded and died to snu snu since the dragon was a top."
3,What kind of company do you work for and how can I get hired?
3,First thing Amethysts are usually more purple then blue. Next up I'd probably make it a +1 or higher weapon depending on the player level and maybe add a bonus damage die. Other then that it seems interesting.
3,"You just need 2  bags of holdings or other trans dimensional storages. Shove them into eachother, while standin right in the dragons face,  creating a portal to the astral sea which sucks everythin in within 10 ft. Now the dragon is stuck there and will die from starvation."
3,"Earth: Sturdyness/Steadfast, you have to keep a bolder aloft while being attacked.

Thunder: you have to create a loud noise to break something

Light: carry a light through a dark maze

Fire: carry a flame through a storm and light a fire pit at the end

Water: swim through an underwater maze

Darkness: defeat a shafowy being in complete darkness (no darkvision)

Lightning: defeat some sort of lightning being

Ice: travel through a blizzard

Wood: find a way to help plants groe in an extreme enviorment

Metal: some sort of smithing challenge"
3,"Did they take out the hag? If no who said they could leave the forest. They have a deal with the eladrin and as long as it is not fulfilled they can't leave, especially now since they already pissed him off earlyer."
3,"Make writing Noir-style short stories part of his backstory too. He started of as a writer (the bard part) and because of doing research for his stories he became an exelent investigator himself. He still does writing stories on the side, some of himself."
3,"18 AC and +6 to hit is pretty good, also you rolled high on health, that is always nice. The +6 to damage is nice against a cursed target too, same for an extra round of action surged eldritch blasts. I would say 8.5/10, a dexterity, wisdom or intelligence save related spell will fu k you up though, and wisdom and dexterity spellsaves are the most common."
3,Then that would alway grant advantage to the leaping attack no matter the caster hiding.
3,">If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. **Make a new attack roll against the new target**, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

It is not, the leap requiers a 2nd attack roll and therefore should not benefit fit from as it is similar to the extra attack feature, which also [gives away your position after the first attack](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2016/10/24/does-an-hidden-fighter-with-extra-attack-attack-a-target-to-get-advantage-on-all-4-arrows/) further more the 2nd attack from the leap does not come from a creature that is hidden but jumps from a creature that is out in the open and can be seen by anyone. If you want to rule differently on your table you do you, but by RAW there is no reason for it to have advantage on the 2nd target."
3,Emmet in Lego Movie 2.
3,"By RAW no, only the first attack has advantage as you are no longer hidden after it and everybody knows where you are from the magic bolt coming out of the bushes. You would need to break line of sight and hide again."
3,"In 5e it is different, each class has their own spell list. Forgot to mention the edition I was talkin about ."
3,"Phantom Steed is a wizard spell but you could take the Ritual Caster feat to gain access to it and cast it without using a spellslot, since it isa ritual spell. The feat would also give you acces to Find Familiar and orher neat spells."
3,"The important thing to know about orcs is that even if they are a folk of war they also are great brewers and farmers. Every year in autum they celebrate the Orctober fest where they celebrate the end of the harvest, compare beer and play the traditional Orc music on the orcordeon while wearing theaditional Orc lederhosen."
3,"Tiefling Oathbreaker Paladin. Tiefling give themself names based on what they want to be in life so obviously his name is Death. Find Steed allows you to get a pale horse as mount, maybe even a skeletal one. Paladins are great damage dealers with their smites, you can even go a sorcerer multiclass (Shadow magic) to get more spellslot for your smites.

Edit: talking 5e"
3,">So yeah, now I need to think of ways to get these guys to be better Orcs :D

Advanced raiding taktics and better equipment. Teach them how to use sieg weapons, strategic positioning and how to produce high quality armor and weapons."
3,Why waste good meat?
3,They specialize in stealing high quality ingredients and selling them to high prices. [Here is more info on them](https://toriko.fandom.com/wiki/Gourmet_Yakuza)
3,Criminal background and proficiency in cooking tools and be part of the Gourmet Mafia.
3,Fighter seems the best no matter if your DM uses Matt Mercer's gun rules or the DMG's as you can shoot 4 times per round at later levels and  have access to the Archety fighting style.
3,"It depends how stealthy you want him to be  if not at all go with heavy armor.

But as an alternative you could go warforged and switch your core how you need it."
3,"Name the NPCs Bob, Billy Bob, Bobby, Boblin, Bob Jr., Bobert and Kyle.

For the PC: Ayfor Gott."
3,Tell that to the raging barbarian whrn he grapples you and continious to smash your face in the neares rock for destroying his beloved weapon.
3,"Now the weapons have to make dex saves, which in case of a sentient weapon could be hillarious."
3,Some strange magical effects and weird beast appeared in the land a while ago seemingly out if nowhere. The timing coincides with a giant explosion at the wizard tower. The party is hired to investigate the effects and find a solution. This eventually leads them to the wizard tower and the knowledge of the wizard performing some sort of ritual which failed and caused the problems. To solve the magical problems they have to find the materials (which are abviously in ateas that are affected by the problematic magic) and complete the ritual succesfully.
3,"Difficult yes, impossible no. It might take them longer and turn into an Odysee like thing but they could make it, if they don't die ln a storm."
3,Not really as I am to lazy to keep track of weapon hp and don't want to bother my players with it either
3,It's the suprise and the squishyness of the 2 classes that made you op.
3,You would need the crossbow expert feat to shoot the hand crossbow but who says you can't smack someone with it. And yes I know you could not reload after the shot since you would be holding a scimitar in your other hand and thus not have a free hand to reload.
3,So the dark armies devastate the land exept near the stronghold where they are under the controll of the princess. Why not flip it around by having the BBEG controll the shadow demons to stop them from raveging the countries and then seeing that they could be used to maintain peace in the land. With killing the first BBEG they now have unleashed a bigger rvil and the princess is trying to fix it. The dark army under her controll is trying to protect the innocents and stop the ravenging armies. Maybe to lighten up the people they hide the fact that shit is going down ftom the people and instead are prepearing a giant festival at the stronghold and the party gets tasked to help with preparations.
3,"You can only attack as a bonus action when you take the attack action with a light weapon and also have another light weapon in your off-hand. Since casting a xantrip is the cast a spell action and not the attack action you can not attack as a bonus action.

However it is possible for a sorcrrer to uwe quickened spell metamagic to cast a spell as bonus action and then use your action to attack. This however is limited by your sorcery points."
3,"Their actions might cause indirect harm to other people like creating or freeing dangerous monsters just to see what they'll do, starting a revolution based on their own lies and rumors and then observe the out come, drop drugs into the river, ect.. They are a scientist by definition as they observe the outcome of their ""experiments"" take notes and then proceed to the next without cleaning up their mess."
3,"Go full rogue: Steal where you can, but give credit to the person you stole from."
3,r/lfg is the place to go
3,If I know anything about DnD players asking this stuff it is going to be [this](https://youtu.be/mYvAYwpUDv8)
3,Why wipe out the village when you can take it over and make it the base of opperation for a revolution/takeover of the entire country and later the entire world!!!
3,Barbarian turning monk to learn controlling his emotions after he killed his best friend in a rage.
3,"After 45 years of DnD being around it's hard to come up with something original that has never been done before. If they think it is boring without even trying, they should take thr DM seat and create something origonal themself."

3,">we make perception checks to see if we can spot any criminal aquatic life

>DM: Something definetly seems fishy.

The group I DM has an ongoing joke about everybody in the campaign actually being an oblex after they read about them. Can't wait to introduce a single oblex in the whole campaign just to mess with them."
3,"As a wizard go just close enough to the danger so that fireball hits the enemy.

Life Cleric is a decent multiclass as you gain heavy armor proficiency at level 1, making you a little more tanky."
3,"Since the save question is answered, just so you know you chose either the barbarian unarmored defense or the monks, the both do not combine."
3,"All sorts of creatures, different beasts, a variety of small insects, humanoids of all sorts a d lots of other things."
3,"Add an oblex that just wanted to experience being a human. Town people say an NPC is acting a little strange. When they investigate they find clues that indicate the family of said NPC hofong somethnig, then the death of the NPC and the oblex. The thing is the NPC allowed himself to be consumed by the oblex as he was incurable ill and dying already, so he struck a deal with the oblex so that it would take his place and care for his family."
3,Cloak of Elvenkind for Stealth advantage.

3,"The beartrap-pittrap-trap: ot co sists of a very obvious bear trap and a very well hidden pit trap right next to it. People who try to avoid the beartrap will fall into the pittrap, which may or may not contain a bear."
3,"Tony Stark and Peter Quill are both charismatic playboys so why not go with a Paladin/bard multiclass. Obviously start as Paladin for heavy armor proficiency and go for 2 levels to get possible smites, take the rest in bard (Valor or Lore). As a bard you have plenty of options to chose from enchantment and illusion spells to controll combat, some nice damage spells and can assist allies with your inspiration. And since both classes profit from high charisma you make a great face/leader type chatacter, like your chosen avenger/guardian characters."
3,"Black Dragonborn is nice, grapple an enemy then vomit acid in their face. Also the Str nonus is nice too and with racial feats from U A you could gain wings for your dragonborn or a fearsom roar."
3,A lore bard that uses Animate Dead to create background dancers for his performance. Obviously wears a red leather armor.
3,">my dm is not going to allow healing spells or abilities besides revivify and spare the dying

You should prepare more then one character because you are going to die, a lot. For the first character I would suggest a Circle of the Shepherd Druid that focuses on summoning creatures as not only can they be used as a wall to keep between you and the enemies you and your allies also gain some temporary hp from some of your abilities. Also lots of utility as a druid."
3,[This guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5uc1r2/how_to_write_character_backstories_for_dnd/) helped me a lot.

3,"Bear totem barbarian has it and some magic items can give it to you, armor of resistance gor example."
3,Cold and lightning because I like the storm aspect they have and both are forces of nature that can be hard to fight against.
3,Nothing more statisfying then hearing the splashing of a goblins head when your maul hits him.
3,The answer is close to infinite speed as you can have a bunch of transmutation school wizards give you their transmuter stone to add 10 ft to your movement. So the limit depends on how many transmutation wizards you can find in the whole planes of existance.
3,"You first rage using your bonus action and then use your regular action to attack so that you gain your rage benefits.

A bonus action is like a small quick thing you can do and only certain things can be a bonus action like rage, certain spells or an off hand attack while dual wielding light weapons. A regular action takes longer and can therefore not be used as a bonus action like attacking, dashing, most spells, ect. (Certain class abilities let you do these things as a bonus action like rogue's cunning action, sorcerers metamagic quickened spell, monk's step of the wind)"
3,"Malar maybe? He is a lesser deity of evil lycsntrops, hunts and moon"
3,Intelligence checks are the bane of the barbarian.
3,I refuse to take the time and do research myself when I can have people on the internet do it for me! /s
3,"My kobold artificer developed a net ammunition for his hammer-crossbow, yes it is a crossbow with a hammer attached to it that smashes people within 5ft of you using springs. Other modifications include a potion catapult (for when I'm out of reach to administrate a healing potion to an ally or want to shoot bottles of alchemusts fire or acid at people) and exploding caltrope or ballbering bolts. I don't need the grappling hook myself since I managed to get boots of flying (rocket boots for flavor)."
3,"You are definetly better off without him if he quits from you having lucky rolls. Go and try to find a better DM, maybe on r/lfg."
3,"r/lfg might be your salvation. Ask and see if someone in your area would like to join or come in over skype, make new friends."

I think that Level 0 characters that only have a few hit points are much more likely to stick together and work together like a team than characters who are Level 20 and act like gods.

If so, is anyone an artist who can help me with this?  I am eager to see how people like this adventure.  It is full of all new plant-based creatures, challenges and moral quandaries.

4,"I have never been satisfied with the experience systems I see in role-playing games.  I want an experience system that:

&#x200B;

1. is realistic,

2. is accurate,

3. is easy to use,

4. is easy to understand,

5. gives the players control over how much experience their characters get,

6. empowers players to manage and monitor their characters experience instead of the dungeon master and

7. rewards only those who try, fail and keep trying.

All seven of these requirements can be achieved with one rule:

Characters gain 5 XP each time they re-attempt a failed ability check.

Wait a minute.  The DM is the one who needs to be careful not to railroad too much.  How does a player railroad the DM?  You're in charge.  Don't let the players boss you around.

*""...I spend more time looking up obscure rules...""*

First of all, I never open a book or look up a rule during the game.  That just slows things down.  As DM, I just make a judgement call at the moment and move on. 

*""...they both keep fighting me on every ruling I make...""*

Role playing is a game.  Games are supposed to be fun.  Establish a rule that no rules lookups will take place during a game.   If the players want to argue about rules, do it between games.  Second rule, no fighting or arguing.  It takes away from the fun of the game.

*""Should I just give up and quit?""*

How much do you enjoy role playing?  Maybe you'd have more fun if you found different players.  But before you do that, just talk to your players between games.  Tell them you're not having fun because of all the arguing and fighting about rules.  Set some ground rules.

Therefore, this kind of rabbit's CR should be almost the same, if not the same as, any ordinary rabbit. I feel like you are trying to re-define the Mirror Image spell and I feel you would do better to create a whole new spell for your use."
4,"""the rabbit has a chance to turn a hit into a miss three times""
The rabbit still has to roll 1d20 in order to even have that chance, so it's not guaranteed three times
""so maybe 45 damage total that's evaded""
again, that is not guaranteed and that is why I think the AC and CR should not be changed from that of a normal rabbit.

Sorry, i just don't see it the way you do.  I see what you are trying to do, but I just personally don't look at it that way."
4,"I really don't think that this one 2nd level spell would have much impact on a rabbit's challenge rating.  If someone tries to attack the rabbit, the rabbit gets a chance to roll a 1d20 and maybe get a chance to redirect the attack to a mirror image.  And that's only if the attack on the rabbot is not an area attack; if it is, then the actual rabbit is likely to receive damage or other effects even if the attack is redirected.  This spell does not really give the rabbit much of an advantage, so I would give this rabbit the same challenge rating as I would give a rabbit without this spell: 0 CR / 10 XP."
4,"I didn't know that, but I still don't see a reason why those two numbers wouldn't be exactly the same in this situation."

2) What you don't like about each character and want to avoid when making your cleric and

3) What appears to be a stereotype of the class and how to avoid reinforcing it when making your cleric.

This is actually the strategy I used to conduct a market analysis to locate programs similar to the one I designed for my capstone project for school.  This type of analysis should give you a good understanding of how people build clerics.  Since no one else in your group has one, your"
4,I wouldn't think that [Mirror Image](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Mirror%20Image#content) would have any impact on a [rabbit](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Rabbit_(5e_Creature))'s AC or CR ( 11 or 0 ); I feel like the spell gives a pretty good description of the mechanics.  Or am I misunderstanding the question?

4,"It's beautiful.  No changes are necessary.  I would just add a few pages of some descriptive text in the form of a legend.  That way, you can describe points of interest on the map."
4,I remember getting obsessed with *Curse of the Azure Bonds*; I recall playing it in an emulator not that long ago.
4,"It is a map maker.  But you can import images, so you could import a pin image and put it anywhere on the map you wanted to, any number of times."
4,I created a basic campaign outline that was inspired by the way Julius Caesar used to conquer nations without violence.
4,I use Inkarnate Pro.  It only costs $5 per month.

4,"Thank you for the continued feedback.  I will see what I can put together.  I did try to make the rooms such that the characters would have to spend more time in each one, but maybe I will have to work harder.  I do value your input.

I created a blueprint of the Farting Beholder and added it to my document.  I don't know if you have a copy of it, so here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u20wR9sXlAbVznwx9Jqo44Q_CkiY16Ta"
4,Thanks.  I am just not sure how to improve things right now.
4,Check out a [challenge rating calculator.](https://dhmstark.co.uk/rpgs/encounter-calculator-5th/)  It doesn't look very balanced to me.  It looks like the party of level 10 characters is about twice as powerful as the party of level 5 characters.
4,It's a lovely map; now it needs a legend with some nice text descriptions of some of the points of interest.

4,"Let me know if I can help further.  You should be able to use free Inkarnate to create such a tower, I would think.  You can also use DungeonFog, but the free version will only let you save one map.  Also, donjon will generate a round, hexagonal or square dungeon complete with rooms; that might suit your needs."

4,"If my players are not paying attention to the game, I just skip them and they lose their turn.  They learn very quickly to either pay attention or else they might as well leave."
4,"Best practice is 6 people or less at the table.  Even if you keep the number of enemy creatures low, no matter what their number of HP, having so many people at the table means all combats are going to run painfully slowly. Some people don't mind long combats; I am not one of those individuals.  The more people you have at the table, the more likely two or three of the players not actively involved in something going on are going to start a non-game-related conversation.  Best of luck to you running so many people, but really recommend you split the group up; you are going to have a hard time otherwise."
4,"Every time someone expresses an interest in joining one of my games, I am incredibly flattered.  No, it would not be weird.  Apologize for interrupting them and then just dive in and say you'd like to find a group to play with.  They may say sure or they may say their group is full, but you won't know until you ask.  Introduce yourself.  Make some new friends.  Just be aware that they are playing a game so maybe try to catch their attention between games, before they start or after they finish.  But I am sure they will be happy to either let you join their game or else they will help you find another game.  Don't be too shy to express your interest in having fun!"
4,I know you said so.
4,How about an onion that makes the target cry because it bites them?
4,"Don't worry about giving your character high attributes; instead, focus more on making a character flawed, three-dimensional, complicated, interesting and fun."
4,"I had an idea for an adventure module.  A girl died in a farm field and no one else in the farming colony even bothered to look for her.  Her vengeful soul infused the farm fields.  Now, once a year on the day of her death, the crops come to life and seek out a sacrifice.  I envision pumpkins, corn and squash killing people in gruesome ways.  This evil carrot reminds me of my adventure idea."
4,"What kind of inspiration do you need?  They need to get the agates back.  Where are the agates right now?  Where are they going to be?  How can you get to them?  Disguise yourselves as one of the guards?  Break into the evidence locker?  Cast an illusion on the agates?  Cast a sleep spell on one of the guards?  Somehow replace the agates with fakes?  Maybe manipulate the situation so that the city watch willingly gives the agates back to the characters?  Maybe start a fire so that the city watch has to quickly move the agates somewhere else and you can grab them while they are in transit and relatively unguarded?  Maybe wait for the agates to be transferred somewhere and then ambush the armored transport.  Maybe tunnel into the evidence room from underneath.  Maybe wait for the agates to be taken out of the evidence locker and brought to court where they will be guarded less than in evidence, so you can grab them right out of the courtroom."
4,This is fantastic!!  It would make me so terrified of picking carrots from the ground ever again!
4,"I recently created an adventure module that contains lots of cool traps.  On the last page of the module, there are several links to discussion threads with long, long lists of lots and lots of traps.  Some are lethal and some are not.  Some are obvious and some are not.  Some are funny and some are dickish.  [Here, check it out.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10unBp0ARFwwaq-hf0M-5LbqlvzyOZ7za)"

If the Beachlings love summer so much, maybe the bad guy tries to end summer and bring about autumn and the Beachlings battle him to make summer last as long as possible.  They know that eventually the bad guy will win and he should; after all, the seasons must still turn from one to the other.  But the Beachlings just try to make summer last just one more day, one more day...

Or, maybe the beachlings try to emit as many greenhouses gasses as possible to make it summer all the time on the planet."
4,"My childhood friend attempted to be both the DM and the one player so he could pump his character up with experience; his brother and I shut that down immediately.  ""We're not going to play with you if you do that."""
4,I just did give you some good tips.  Ignore D&D.  Ignore role playing.  Watch YouTube videos and read information online about storytelling.  What made J.R.R. Tolkien such a great storyteller?  What makes Stephen King such a great storyteller? Work on your imagery.  I joined a real-life druidic order decades ago and the training I received in being a Bard has been very helpful in making me a storyteller.  You need to really devote and invest lots and lots of your time and effort is studying storytelling.  It is a huge subject and some people spend their entire lives studying the subject.  There are no shortcuts.
4,I really don't have a preference either way.  I used numbers.  You do what you think is best for you.  I don't know if numbers or letters is best for you.  I am interested in seeing how your project progresses and how it differs from mine.
4,"I created a series of maps and legends and, before I knew what was happening, I had an atlas.  It turned out okay.  I like your maps better.  But take a look; maybe you will get inspiration from this: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/280759/World-Atlas-of-Rodinia?term=world+atlas+of+rodi"
4,I find myself wishing for a legend so that I can read about all of these different places.
4,"Spend a LOT of time learning to be a great storyteller.  Don't worry about the rules so much.  Be a dramatic, theatrical storyteller. Be descriptive.  Engage 9 of your audience's senses: sight, smell, sound, touch, taste, time, distance, direction and danger/doom."
4,"Personally, I think it is best to have 6 or fewer people at the table.  Anything more than that and you start to have people pairing off and having their own private conversations and that starts to ruin the fun."
4,Read a manual.
4,Props for making a unique character concept and not being so focused on having high attribute scores and getting out of your comfort zone.  Yay for trying something different!  Shatter stereotypes!
4,"In my opinion, the primary responsibility of a DM is to make sure that all of the players and the DM have a fun time.  The second responsibility is to be a great storyteller.  Read up on being a dramatic, theatrical storyteller.  Don't sweat the rules so much, interactive storytelling is so much more important than the rules."
4,"He looks cute and funny yet dangerous at the same time.  I feel the urge to pat him on the head, yet I am afraid to do so at the same time.  :)"
4,"I like it!  Fear of magic and magic items.  I have never heard of someone trying that before.  As a DM, I reward behavior that I like to see and creative, unique character creation is one of those things.  Take an extra 100 XP!"
4,Yes.

4,"The DM calls the shots. If you are not having fun while playing and you have already tried to address the issue with the DM and you still are not having fun, then why are you still sitting at the table?  Go find a group with which you can have fun."
4,[This](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/92966/can-you-make-a-pc-who-is-a-werewolf) thread looks like it has some useful information.  And I have to say it...where?  Where wolf?
4,There is an OLD D&D adventure module named Temple of the Frog; it contains half-frog soldiers wielding laser rifles and laser pistols.  You might want to take a look at the mechanics of those weapons.
4,"Uh-uh, YOU try it on."
4,"I do not feel long combat is enjoyable, either in role playing time or in real time.  Please end this discussion and move on."
4,"In real life, combat is fast, chaotic, confusing and brutal.  How many times do you think you can swing a sword before your arm gets tired?  Try it.  10?  Maybe 20?  Personally, I prefer heavy role playing mixed in with the occasional combat.  If you think long combat can be fun, that is fine.  I respectfully disagree."
4,"Respectfully disagree, but you do what you find fun.  I personally like combat to be swift and brutal."
4,"I have been playing role playing games since 1983 and I have never experienced a combat, even a mass combat, that took more than an hour."
4,"If you're interested, I have created a tavern and added a LOT of detail. You might have fun there: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u20wR9sXlAbVznwx9Jqo44Q_CkiY16Ta"
4,"Hey, you do what you want.  But I would respectfully suggest you try very, very hard to speed combat up by any means necessary.  In real life, combat is quick, chaotic, scary and confusing.  Your combat does not sound like that at all.  As a DM, I keep the pace of the game quick and exciting at all times."
4,"I would leave the game if combat took more than an hour.  The DM should keep up the game pace or else the experience gets distorted.  In real life, combat is quick and chaotic and confusing."
4,"Yes, I know.  That is still insane for combat to last so long."
4,I hope you enjoy so much combat; I don't know of anyone who does.
4,"4 or 5 hours of combat?  That sounds absolutely exhausting.  No, you shouldn't have to hold back at all.  You should be trying to end the combat as quickly as possible.  No mortal can engage in combat for that many hours; you'd be exhausted."
4,"I just take an overall idea and break it up into adventures and then break each adventure up into scenes.  As far as the theme, style or tone, I look for inspiration and when I find it, I ask myself if that sounds like something that could or would make an interesting adventure or campaign.  I try to see if anyone has ever tried it before."
4,"[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12t8jH1pF-wQkvxIXSqumxERb3FG4pWJF) is a program I made that generates random magic items.  Each item has both a random enchantment and a random curse.  Some are quite funny.  I thought this might help you to add more items to your list, which is quite impressive already.  Keep up the great work!"
4,"I do admire unique and creative ideas; as a DM, I actually reward players with a lot of extra experience points. I reward desired behavior with experience."
4,"I have a half-finished adventure about goblin pirates.  I have a cool idea for how goblin pirates can take over another ship.  As many goblins as possible climb up the main mast to the top. Then, they all lean toward the target ship. The ship leans over until the top of the main mast hits the rail of the target ship.  Then, the goblins let go and suddenly the target ship has dozens of goblins on board and the goblins take over within seconds.  In my mind, one poor unfortunate goblin lets go too late and gets catapulted a hundred yards away when the attacking ship rights itself.  :)"
4,Careful - you should specify that you are looking for *constructive* criticism.  :)
4,"Well-said. I agree with you.  Too many people at the table means too many people talking and too many interruptions.  I would try to filter out the disruptive people and then if it is still necessary, split the group into multiple smaller groups, maybe each one playing on a different day.  GM + 5 max, I agree with that.  I like smaller, more intimate groups."
4,I always enjoy people doing impressions.  I was just trying to think outside the box and do an impression no one thought of before.
4,"I wish I could.  That was really hard to pull off.  I used Christopher Walken's tone of voice, John Wayne's stiff way of moving and standing and Charlton Heston's slow speaking of ""My...God"".  It came across beautifully.  My co-workers were stunned. I got a standing ovation."
4,I once did an impression of Christopher Walken doing an impression of John Wayne doing an impression of Charlton Heston.  I don;t know how I pulled it off.  I doubt I could do it again.
4,"1. I don't think more than 6 at a table is a good idea.
2. It sounds to me like you have more problems than just too many people.  It sounds to me like you have players who are being disruptive.  You may be able to solve your problem of having too many people by removing players who ruin the fun for others.  I don't want to encourage you to kick anybody out, but, if they are ""bullshitting"", then they need to stop or be asked to leave."
4,"Tell your DM that you are not having fun and give him specific reasons why.  Be polite, do it in private, do it between games and be very matter-of-fact and not emotional.  Give him a chance to try to make sure you have fun.  But, if it doesn't work out and you are still not having fun, then why are you still at the table?  You're not being paid to be there, you are looking for fun.  Do yourself a favor and find another group.  However, you might not have fun with that new group, either.  Finding a group you enjoy is like dating; you usually have to try out several different people until you find ""the one"".  Best of luck!"
4,"Make the room itself a mimic.  Heck, make an entire house a mimic.  The characters walk right into its maw."
4,Check out [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com)
4,"Yeah, maybe this method is not too subtle.  If the characters are standing there, trying to rack their brains, trying to figure out a way to get in, yeah, just have some guards escorting a horse-drawn prison wagon slowly roll right past them.  Maybe have it get stuck in a rut and stop right in front of them.  Maybe the party could actually lock eyes with the prisoners.  Then, the wagon starts moving again."
4,"That is such a tricky thing. The players must have freedom to achieve their goals any way they see fit and they will almost always think of something that you would never have thought of in a million years.  Perhaps you could have guards pushing a cart with a wooden cage containing prisoners into the castle and the cart moves right past the party.  With the right timing, they might catch the idea."
4,"1. Sneak in, maybe through a sewer pipe
2. Disguise yourself as a guard or servant and get in that way
3. Get yourselves deliberately arrested so that you get shackled and dragged in
4. Start a fire in the castle to force them to open the doors so you can just walk right in"
4,Agreed.  Table by table and everyone at the table has to agree to it beforehand.  Try to avoid stuff like racism and rape.
4,Is there not a comic book store in Columbus?  I live in Dayton and we have them here.
4,Best of luck!

4,"""Dungeon Crawl Classics"".  Each player selects 4 pre-generated Level 0 characters from a pile of characters on little index card-sized pieces of paper.  All the players have to do is write down a name and select a simple alignment and then it is time to play.  The characters are typically 1 or 2 HP each, so they are very fragile and die frequently.  The players quickly realize that they have to stick together and work like a team in order to have any hope of survival.  I find it very, very fun!"
4,Just spitballing ideas.
4,"I always used to be the DM when I role played with my friends decades ago.  But, since I started playing again a few months ago, I have been a player and I have played only DCC games.  I am in love.  All I have to bring is a pencil, an eraser, a pencil sharpener and some dice.  I don't even have to make a character.  Free at last, free at last."
4,"There is a role playing system named Middle Earth Role Playing; in one of their documents, the Witch King is characterized as a mage/sorcerer."
4,Self-hating paladin?
4,Any time.  Glad to help.
4,"I've used it a few times.  It looks like, if you enter the number of characters in the party and what level they are, it will generate a list of encounters of varying difficulty.  Then, I guess you can sort through creatures and monsters and try to find one or more with the recommended number of experience points or challenge rating."
4,It depends upon what level the characters are. Have you seen this?  https://dhmstark.co.uk/rpgs/encounter-calculator-5th/
4,[This](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dV2ypN9ktyFTGfS6WGt8FaQjxYlTV7sZ) might help you organize an adventure.
4,Take a look for a challenge rating calculator.  That should give you some good guidance.
4,D&D Beyond.
4,Take a look at a creature called an oblex.  It can consume a person's memories and then create a replica of that person and imbue the replica with the original's memories.  That would be a *kind* of immortality.

4,That would probably turn out all wight!  :)
4,"Watching YouTube videos would certainly help.  And learn about the 3 types of d20 rolls: ability checks, attack rolls and saving throws.  That will give you a good foundation in D&D mechanics."
4,Noted; my recommendation stands.
4,I hope you all have a fun time!
4,Please be careful discussing real life races and D&D races; I was banned for 5 days for doing so.
4,"Any time.  I have more to share, so just ask if you want to see more.  Also, if your players are wanting classic D&D, look up DCC, or ""Dungeon Crawl Classics"".  It is a brutal slaughterhouse and it is fun!  All characters are pre-generated and Level 0.  Each one has usually 1 to 2 HP, which means they die frequently.  Each player chooses 4 characters from a pile of pre-generated characters and away you go.  The fact that each character has only 1 or 2 HP means that the party really has to stick together and work together in order to survive.  It is REALLY fun!  That is th eonly kinf of D&D I have played for months.  I love it!"
4,"Well, here's an adventure module that I have recently created.  It is a one-level dungeon created by an Oblex.  The Oblex has filled the dungeon with traps that are not lethal but that test the characters for intelligence.  It needs to consume the memories of intelligent humanoids: https://drive.google.com/open?id=10unBp0ARFwwaq-hf0M-5LbqlvzyOZ7za"
4,"Maybe you could create an adventure that is basically a ""pub experience"".  Your characters can sing karaoke and try out the mechanical centaur!"
4,"[This](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u20wR9sXlAbVznwx9Jqo44Q_CkiY16Ta) isn't an adventure, it's a description of a medieval tavern.  There is a blueprint of the place, there is a cute name and corporate logo, there is a funny bar food menu, there are stat sheets for the owner, the staff and even one of the place's regulars and there is a long list of different and interesting things characters can do while they are there.  I think it would really be cool for you to have a D&D tavern adventure while you are sitting in a real life tavern."
4,"It is a dungeon created by an Oblex and the traps are not meant to be fatal, they are meant to test the characters for intelligence.  Just so you know.  Good luck."
4,Absolutely agree.  Visual scale has a great impact on me and I don't think I am the only one. Good work! <hands you a cookie>
4,"I never did hear back for you, so I thought I'd follow up.  How did it go?  Please let me know.  What sucked and what was great?"
4,"I just happen to have a maze full of traps, if you want to use it.  Here is a module I am almost done with named [Mouth of the Oblex](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10unBp0ARFwwaq-hf0M-5LbqlvzyOZ7za)."
4,That is a COOL new creature!  And I love you how put a humanoid next to it to give a sense of size and scale.
4,Where's Johnny Cash?  :)
4,Thanks.  I thought it might give you some ideas you might want to incorporate into your own tavern.
4,"It's a joke, making fun of a Kenny Rogers song."
4,"You got to know when to golem, know when to fold 'em..."
4,There is a role playing game named *Middle Earth*; you should check it out.
4,Inkarnate.  I recognize that art.  Maybe try drawing trails between civilizations.
4,I found a group on Meetup.
4,"My first was one in Cincinnati.  It wasn't newly-opened and we went late at night, so it was almost empty.  But it was two stories and HUGE and still a LOOOONG walk.  The one in Indianapolis was just as big as the other one, but for the first year it was open, it was an absolute madhouse with parking a mile away, taking a bus, walking even further just to get into the place, then the LOOOONG walk once you get in the door.  It just never ends."
4,Check out the Oblex.  I just learned about it and it is so cool.  It can devour memories and it has impressive telepathic abilities.  It might fit what you need.
4,"That is hysterical.  Have you even been in an Ikea?  They are literally multi-story mazes.  They are so large that they provide lockers for you to store your things so you don't have to carry them all over the place, like at amusement parks.  When they opened up a new store in Indianapolis, not only did they dedicate an entire highway off ramp to Ikea (they actually put Ikea's name on the off ramp sign permanently!), but you had to park a half mile away and then take a city bus just to get close to the store and then you still had to walk several hundred yards after getting off the bus to get into the place.  The employees deliberately make it difficult for you to leave without walking through the entire thing.  The place is an absolute circus."
4,"It sounds to me like this particular role playing group was not an ideal fit for you.  Please do not let it put you off of role playing.  Finding a group that you really enjoy is like dating; sometimes you have to try out several different ones before you find ""the one""."
4,Thank you.  The issue may be something the DM can solve.
4,"Speak with the DM between games.  Tell the DM that you used to enjoy your games but not nearly so much anymore.  Make sure to give specific reasons why.  You and the DM should determine if you really are a good fit with this particular group.  It may be time for you to go elsewhere. There is no shame in that at all.  Finding a role playing group you like is like dating; it takes time and sometimes several attempts before you find ""the one""."
4,Hopefully you both can get through this stuff and get back to having fun.
4,Mentos...the axe maker!!
4,"Yes.  When confronting someone, always do it between games and in private.  If it bothers you when people interrupt you, you should say so to the entire group and they will obey your wishes for the most part.  Just apologize to him and move on."
4,[DMsguild.com](https://DMsguild.com) and [DriveThruRPG.com](https://DriveThruRPG.com) both have adventures and campaigns you can use.
4,You should give him as much control as possible over his character and he should work a lot harder at trying to play along with the game and not get so caught up into his own personal stuff.
4,I did something very similar!  [Take a look...](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u20wR9sXlAbVznwx9Jqo44Q_CkiY16Ta)
4,"Sir, I believe your axe requires floss.  :)"
4,"Hey, all I can do is act on the information I am given. You don't need to be so aggressive."
4,"*""What kind of clues around the town/his house would help lead my PCs in the right direction?""*  If it walks into the village and then walks back out, doesn't it leave footprints?  I just don't understand what clues you think the party should be looking for.  Just follow it back to its lair or else follow its footprints.  This doesn't sound like much of a challenge at all.  Respectfully recommend this story plot needs more vetting."
4,"How would a shark be terrorizing a village?  If he is attacking people in the water, all the party needs to do is find a Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer or Wizard who can cast *Water Breathing* and follow the shark to its lair."
4,"He shot the sheriff, but he didn't shoot the deputy."
4,"Perhaps you could move him somewhere way out to sea, so he's not bothering anyone.  Perhaps you could cure him.  Perhaps you could build a giant aquarium for him.  Do you *have* to kill him?"
4,"I have a few modules I have created and published on [DMsguild.com](https://DMsguild.com).  They are listed as ""Pay what you want"", so you can grab them for free and see if they look like something you want to try to play through.  My name is Alan Robinson, so just look for works by that name.  Also, I am almost done with a new cool module named [Mouth of the Oblex](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10unBp0ARFwwaq-hf0M-5LbqlvzyOZ7za); please take a copy and play test it for me. Thanks!"
4,"A cleric that has seer-type spells but s/he has been magically miniaturized, but grows back to his/her full size when the ball is broken."
4,"C'mon, don't be shitty...:)"
4,"As far as the party splitting up into two groups, if they want to do this, you should let them.  You need to try to give the players as much control over their universe as possible.

As far as talking on the phone and having side conversations, what I do as a DM is ask a player what they want to do and if they don't hear me I skip their turn and move on to the next person; if the player does not pay attention then they miss out on the fun.

Finally, if you are not having fun, it is time to stop the game, even in mid-game, and reassess where you are at. If everyone at the table is not having fun, you need to fix things so they do have fun, even you the DM.  Otherwise, if you're not getting paid to do this and you're not having fun, what ARE you doing?"
4,"Is your party tired?  Because they look pooped.  And by the way, take an extra 15 XP for using the word ""ruckus"".  :)"
4,Have them all meet each other for the first time at a [tavern](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u20wR9sXlAbVznwx9Jqo44Q_CkiY16Ta).
4,Each party member can make an appearance there.  They can get a hot meal to eat.  They can purchase traveler's rations.  They can play some games and gamble.  They can unwind.  They can eventually meet each other and decide to work together.
4,That depends upon how many of them there are; the more exist the less demand there should be and therefore the price should lower.  500GP might be the perfect price...
4,Inkarnate seems designed to create exteriors not interiors.  But I am still happy with that tavern map.
4,"I play DCC exclusively; that way, all characters are pre-generated and I don't have to make that choice.

Easy peasy.

<sitting back smugly>"
4,"I am in the process of creating an adventure module that is chock full of traps (did I just use the word ""chock""?).  It is named [Mouth of the Oblex](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10unBp0ARFwwaq-hf0M-5LbqlvzyOZ7za) and on the last page is a list of pages that contain lots and lots of trap ideas.  Maybe some of them could help you."
4,"Good storytellers find inspiration anywhere: nature, movies, television shows, waiting in line at the Dollar General, anywhere."
4,Take care.
4,"It was a poor attempt at humor.  I was suggesting that maybe you could fool your husband into thinking that D&D is making your anxiety worse.  You know, foam at the mouth, start trying to bite your own face, that kind of stuff.  Just a bad joke."
4,I'm so glad that you have an outlet where you can deal with your personal issues.
4,It might.  But maybe you could pretend like it's making your issues worse...:)
4,"No, you're fine.  It is similar to online.  You get the idea.  You can ""be someone else"".  I think that many people would find the concept refreshing, to just take a break from being themselves for a while and be someone else.  What freedom!"
4,"I'll let you in on a really cool secret.  When you are role playing, you are pretending to be an entirely different person.  Quite possibly a person who doesn't have anxiety.  Think about that for a minute.  D&D is a technique by which you can put aside your social issues for just a few hours and pretend to be a person with completely different social issues.  How great is that?  Take a break from your normal self and be someone else for a while.  I find it very cathartic."
4,Wolves that are men.  And why can't women be wolves?  And what about a werewolf during a half moon?
4,"Relax.  We were all newbies at one point and we know what it is like to be one, so we are usually compassionate towards newbies.  You are about to be involved in an interactive storytelling adventure.  Just follow along and do what the other players do.  Tell the DM what your character wants to do. The DM will tell you if you need to roll in order to determine whether or not you succeed in what you want to do.  Don't worry about the rules, you'll learn those as you go.  Just relax, enjoy yourself and try to help everyone else enjoy themselves, too.  The DM will describe the environment in which your character finds themselves.  You get to decide what your character does.  Once you announce what your character intends to do, the DM will theatrically describe what actually happens.  It's that easy.  Just don't be a silent wallflower.  Interact. That's what you are there to do.  But don't take over the whole game.  Give other players a chance to join in the fun, too.  You'll be fine. <waves dismissively>"
4,Why are you talking like that?
4,"A have a few adventure modules I created and published on [DMsguild.com](https://DMsguild.com).  They are listed under my name, Alan Robinson.  They are all listed as ""Pay what you want"".  So grab a copy of them, all for free.  Just let me know what you think of them.  Also, [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10unBp0ARFwwaq-hf0M-5LbqlvzyOZ7za) is one I am almost done with but I need some more play test feedback, please."
4,Where?  Where wolf?
4,I can't find any reference to that anywhere.
4,I found my group on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com).
4,"The oblex consumes memories; when it gets too full, it either goes crazy or spawns off an offspring."
4,Don't worry about the rules or the manuals.  Just be a theatrical storyteller and watch your players to make sure they are enjoying themselves.  Everything else will fall into place.
4,Some type of primitive theremin?
4,Here's the new dungeon one: https://drive.google.com/open?id=10unBp0ARFwwaq-hf0M-5LbqlvzyOZ7za
4,How about a troll that thinks he's a halfling?  How about a changeling/shapeshifter who is indecisive?
4,"Oh, you want funny character ideas?"
4,"Would a troll doing mime be funny, or just annoying and irritating?"
4,"The party comes upon a bear trap on the floor.  If anyone touches, triggers or even tries to disarm the trap, a chute opens in the ceiling right above the trap and a large angry bear lands on the party.  It is called ""The Bear Trap""."
4,Holy f&&&ck!
4,That is certainly up to you and the DM.  I want you both to have fun.  Just try not to make a habit of tiring of your characters and asking for replacements; sometimes it really throws a wrench in the DM's plans.
4,"Whatever you do, don't shove your thumb up a wyvern's butt; they REALLY don't appreciate it."
4,"I have a few adventure modules published on [DMsguild.com](https://DMsguild.com) under my name, Alan Robinson.  They are all ""Pay what you want"", so go grab them all and see if you like any of them.  I also have a really cool dungeon module I am almost done with, you might like that one, too.  It's full of non-lethal traps that test the characters' intelligence."
4,"I completely agree that having fun is the primary goal of any game.

However, the player said he WAS having fun, but said that he stopped having fun when his character wasn't as powerful anymore.  Well a powerful character does not automatically mean that the player is guaranteed to have a good time.  It sounds to me like the player need to focus less on powerful characters and more on role playing and playing characters that are flawed and yes, maybe weak.  I believe that the player is looking for fun in the wrong place."
4,"I called the witch doctor, he told me what to say..."
4,"What happens if the player creates another character and then tires of that character, too?  Creating another character is no guarantee that the player will suddenly start having fun again.  But you do what you want.  If I was your DM, I would try to work with you to help you have fun again without changing characters."
4,"I have created a small Javascript program that generates a random item and gives it both a random enchantment and a random curse.  Some of the curses are really funny.  If you private message me your email address, I will happily share it with you.  Imagine a magic item that grants the user invisibility but also makes them uncontrollably flatulent!"
4,"Think about it this way...do you like yourself as a person in real life?  You don't have the opportunity to just start over.  You are stuck with yourself and you just have to make the best with what you've got. I'm sorry that your character's life hasn't gone the way you expected.  MY life hasn't gone the way I expected.  But this is the hand I have been dealt and I am going to do the best I can with the resources I have.  If I was your DM, I would respectfully suggest that you learn to love your character and learn how to make your character as effective as s/he can be within his/her limitations. <sorry of this feels heavy-handed>"
4,"I created a Firbolg Druid.  Muscly?  Hell, yeah!"
4,"I have created many random ""whatever"" generators.  If you are interested, just PM me your email address and I will send you a copy of all of them, including the one you inspired me to make.  They are very small but very helpful.  One is a random adventure plot generator and it is very inspirational."
4,"This is a really good map!  I would make the housing district a little smaller.  And you could put some trails between areas of interest.  But you've got the hang of Inkarnate!  I've been using Inkarnate Pro for several months now.  I just created an indoor blueprint of a tavern and it is by far the best map I have created yet.  I just seemed to have a breakthrough.  I hope you do, too.  Keep trying.  Keep making more maps.  D&D players LOVE maps, so keep creating them, more and more.    [Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tKTGg5WL9akLOYtFD-Ia4wmdkRaWZs8G) is my most recent Inkarnate drawing.  See what you think."
4,"No it's not.  Molotov fires can spread, just like fireball spells.  You are just being argumentative and not providing any constructive criticism.  <block>"
4,I've created a small Javascript program that generates a random location name using the names you provided.  It works pretty well.
4,What a sight to behold!
4,"I confess, I created something similar in my youth and I actually named it the ""Dungeon Master's Master Dungeon"".  It was impossibly expansive.  My players couldn't get through it."
4,"***ONE*** of the floors?  Great Googamooga, how big *is* this dungeon?  :)"
4,Fair enough.  But I still think a cleric that worships a deity of knowledge doesn't have to be a genius.
4,"Totally agree, it sounds pretty gross to me.  Why would you portray a centaur peeing?  Do you portray all of your characters peeing and pooping?"
4,"Make a low-IQ cleric.  How many of those do you see?  Shatter a stereotype.  Try role playing a dense, thick cleric.  I think it would be fun.  I've never heard of anyone trying that before."
4,"I like to put all of the characters in a [tavern](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u20wR9sXlAbVznwx9Jqo44Q_CkiY16Ta), so they can get to know one another and a tavern is a natural place for people to meet each other and develop business contacts and maybe get a job working with an adventuring party."
4,"Also, I have used Inkarnate Pro to create a few cities and they are okay, but probably not good enough for what you are wanting."
4,[Here's](https://watabou.itch.io/medieval-fantasy-city-generator) a random medieval fantasy city generator.
4,"You will still need to fill in details and create maps and NPCs, but this document should help you to keep everything organized on a very high level."
4,Even better...!
4,"Seriously, your idea is a marvelous one!  That is why I play D&D, to see people get creative.  In fact, as a DM, I encourage creativity with extra experience points.  You certainly qualify.  Here, take an extra 100 XP; you deserve it.  Good hustle!"
4,Make a molotov cocktail do the same damage as a fireball.
4,"You could make the party encounter some kind of creature that mimics the party's abilities; that way, they will always be evenly matched."
4,"THAT is a cool magic item!  I would use it if I thought that a mimic was nearby, disguised as something."
4,Treat it like a fireball spell.
4,"Tell the DM that you are not having as much fun as you would like to be having.  Cite specific examples of what you are talking about.  Give him time to improve his game.  If he doesn't improve his game, then you should leave the game.  If you're not having fun, why stay?"
4,"This sounds like an excellent campaign idea!  [Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dV2ypN9ktyFTGfS6WGt8FaQjxYlTV7sZ) is a document I came up with to help people organize a campaign.  Each campaign is a series of adventures.  Each adventure is a series of scenes.  Each campaign, each adventure and each scene should have a one-sentence-long description, kind of like a hook or elevator pitch.  These are important; do not overlook them.  Also, each scene may have its own map(s) and/or NPC(s)."
4,"Great question!  When describing the environment in which the characters find themselves, make sure to engage all 9 of the players' senses: sight, smell, sound, touch, taste, time, distance, direction and danger/doom.  Make the players feel the sensations that their characters should be feeling."
4,"I was lucky enough to go to school from home and I work from home as well, so I can help my husband as much as I am able.  But I do feel that human beings require recreation.  He is not interested in role playing.  I love it.  So, I found a group and I have a great time.  They would probably let me be a DM if I asked, but I enjoy the DCC experience.  I don't even have to generate my own character.  All I have to do is show up with some pencils, an eraser, a pencil sharpener and a handful of dice.  It's so simple.  I am a HUGE fan of DCC.  Each individual character is so weak that they have no choice but to work together as a team just so they can survive.  And don't get too attached to any one character.  Each one typically has either 1 or 2 HP, so they die quickly.  It's a slaughterhouse and I love every minute of it!"
4,"I used to be.  I haven't been a DM in decades. I just don't have time for it anymore.  I have a big house, a full-time job and a husband who is chronically ill, like yourself.  But, I insist on having SOME fun in my life.  So, once every two weeks, I go to the local comic book store and I play a DCC adventure.  I participate as a player, which is a novel experience for me, but it is very fun nonetheless."
4,"Yes, those should be excellent skills you can use.  Spin a wonderful, colorful tale.  But this is different from just storytelling.  Here, you give the players as much control over their universe as possible.  So it is an interactive storytelling session.  You describe the setting but the players dictate how the scene unfolds.  All you do is describe their actions.  I am not terribly familiar with D&D 5e rules and I don't care.  I am much more interested in spinning a tall tale that my players will remember and talk about for the rest of their lives."
4,"If you're going to DM, then brush up on your storytelling skills.  Your job is to give a theatrical, dramatic description of the environment in which the characters find themselves.  Engage all 9 of the players' senses: sight, smell, sound, touch, taste, time, distance, direction and danger/doom.  Make the players feel the sensations their characters are supposed to be feeling.  The players will tell you what their characters do, and then you will dramatically and theatrically describe their actions and the consequences of their actions.  Keep a good game pace and don't look up and rules or open any manuals during the game.  Just make your best judgement call and move on.  Don't let the rules overshadow the interactive storytelling experience.  Keep looking around the table and see if your players are having a fun time.  You shouldn't even have to ask them if they are having fun; it should be very obvious if they are engaged."
4,"I'm delighted D&D has benefited you so much!  It is a great way for people to interact and be social.  And for those people who are socially awkward, they can actually pretend to be a different person with different social issues, which many people find refreshing and even therapeutic.  And yes, the people around the table are the most caring, supportive people you will ever meet.  They will accept you for who you are (as long as you don't ruin the fun for anyone else).  I'm so glad this worked out for you!  Brings tears to my eyes."
4,"I wouldn't call it a wasteful writeoff.  Just get their feedback and use it to shape the campaign you are already in.  You don't have to start from scratch.  And don't forget that it is just as important for the DM to be having fun as it is for the players to have fun, too.  Don't forget to tell the players what you find fun and what you don't find fun.  If they have that information, they can help to make sure you have a fun time and then you can work on making sure they have a fun time.  It's a two-way street."
4,That would really make it too easy to learn different shapes.
4,You are looking in the wrong place.  Go back to your players and ask them why they don't seem interested in Ravinica.  Get some constructive feedback from them.  What world would they like to play in?  What theme?  What setting?  Heavy emphasis on role playing or combat?  Do they like sieges?  Heists?  Chase scenes?  Don't ask us...ask them.
4,"The reason I say that is that bipolar is not multiple personality.  I know you know that.  All bipolar does is make you either depressed or manic.  We would need to work out some mechanics where a bipolar character would roll dice once in a while to determine if s/he changes from manic to depressive or vice versa or whether s/he stays in her current ""state"".  Or maybe it should be up to the DM to make such a roll. Either way, it would be a fascinating character to play."
4,"Convince someone else that what you are drinking tastes like alcohol, but there is actually no alcoholic content.  Then the other person drinks like a fish and gets wasted."
4,His ship has literally come in!
4,"When storytelling, you must engage 9 of your audience's senses: sight, smell, sound, touch, taste, time, distance, direction and danger/doom.  If time and distance seem like they are skewed, then the DM needs to spend more time addressing these concepts."
4,I don't even know you and I already love you.  :)
4,"Keep it simple; if you're not having fun, then go look for fun elsewhere."
4,"Whenever someone asks me, ""Can I ask you a question?"", I always reply with ""You just did; now ask me another.""  :)"
4,"As a DM, your job is to theatrically describe the environment in which the players find themselves.  Then, the players announce what their characters do.  Then, you narrate what the characters do and what the consequences of those actions are.  It's like an interactive storytelling session."
4,An oblex can make a replica.
4,"I have been working on an adventure module named ""[Mouth of the Oblex](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10unBp0ARFwwaq-hf0M-5LbqlvzyOZ7za)"".  It sounds like it might be right up your alley!"
4,"Several people have posted messages on this Reddit, wanting to create a Mysterio character.  You should search for these posts."
4,"I was thinking about it even more.  The necromancer could ""set up shop"" along a river, break the dam upriver of his setup area, the flood would kill lots of people and the flood waters would carry the bodies downstream right to the necromancer's ""lair"".  All he would have to do it scoop them up out of the water.  Easy peasy being evil.  :)"
4,"If you could turn the dead into the undead, it might make it easier to harvest soldiers for your army.  Make them come to you, instead of having to collect them yourselves.  Maybe you could hire the people who pull wagons through town, screaming ""Bring out your dead!"" to bring you corpses.  Maybe you could start an epidemic of some type to create a lot of corpses to collect.  Maybe you could engineer a massive disaster like a dam break causing a flood or something to create a lot of corpses.  Maybe you could make it rain water laced with the zombie virus!!"
4,"I agree with you.  I am not overly concerned about  creating a character with all 18s in attributes.  I'd rather have a flawed character that succeeds in some rolls and fails in other rolls and, like you said, develops as a person over time."
4,Maybe make the statue look like an Oscar or an Emmy award...?
4,I LOVE to explore!
4,I think you need a cruise ship so people can enjoy the sights.  :)
4,"But, since there are not motorcycles in D&D, would he be a human on the top and a ...wagon on the bottom?"
4,"As a DM, I reward my players with additional experience points when they do something funny, punny, creative or unique.  You definitely qualify!"
4,"DM Tips:

Don't obsess on the rules.  Having fun is more important.  Flex your storytelling skills.  As DM, your job is to dramatically describe the environment in which the characters find themselves.  Let the players do just about anything they want.  Your job will be to describe their actions and the ensuing consequences.  Engage all 9 of you audience's senses: sight, smell, sound, touch, taste,. time,. distance, direction and danger/doom.  And lastly, make sure everyone at the table has a fun time, yourself included.  All you need to do is look around the table to see if everyone is enjoying themselves, you shouldn't even have to ask.  Best of luck!"
4,"No, i've created multiple Javascript programs that generate random whatevers.  Random magic items, random adventure ideas, random pyramid encounters, etc.  If you are interested in seeing any of these, please feel free to email me at Machiavvelli3060@gmail.com and I will reply and send you a copy of every program I have.  They are very small in size but very useful."
4,"Role playing is a game.  Games are supposed to be fun.  If you are not having fun, then why are you still sitting at the table?  Tell the DM that you are not having fun and specifically why.  If the DM does not increase the fun you are having, it is time for you to leave the group and find a group where you can have fun."
4,"Sorry.  It's a reference to a half-man, half-motorcycle on the Progressive commercials."
4,"It doesn't sit well in Google Drive.  You will need to copy and paste the text into a text document with an "".html"" extension and then run it in a web browser.  If this is not something you are familiar with, please message me and we will execute ""Plan B""."
4,"Understood.  I'm not trying to be TOO pushy, just trying to encourage you to expand your horizons a bit.  If not religiously, then perhaps somewhere else.  Personally, travel opens my horizons.  :)"
4,"It sounds like a really fun concept.  I would do 5 different character sheets, each with the same physical attributes, race and equipment."
4,"I created a program that generates a random item with a random enchantment and a random curse.  For example, a spear that makes the holder invisible but also gives them uncontrollable flatulence."
4,Maybe you want to be a mo-tor instead...
4,"I would certainly run it past the DM before you even begin to create such a character. S/he may not allow it and the DM's word is final.  But, as a DM, I encourage my players to be creative and come up with unique things.  I actually reward such things with extra experience points.  Just talk to your DM first; they may have some good advice or hints or tips for you."
4,"You can tell the DM that you would probably have more fun if you didn't have to follow the rules so closely, but the decision really is up to the DM.  If you're not having fun, then go somewhere where you will have fun."
4,"That sounds like a good plan. Just imagine, 5 different characters, all rolled into one!"
4,That's a shame.  You would really broaden your horizons if you came out of your shell and tried something you've never tried before.
4,"I would think that your physical attributes (STR, DEX and CON) would stay the same.  Maybe your other 3 attributes would change depending upon the personality."
4,"Maybe your character has multiple personalities and s/he can actually change shape to fit each personality.  Maybe that's why you got kicked out, because you couldn't control when you change from one guise to another."
4,"Are you looking to make a character with 2 distinct personalities or are you wanting to create one character with 2 different ""moods""?"
4,[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12t8jH1pF-wQkvxIXSqumxERb3FG4pWJF) is a program that generates random magic items.
4,I said maybe you could run a Scooby Doo themed adventure.
4,Maybe a race that can change its shape and it also has multiple personalities?
4,Maybe a *Scooby Doo* themed adventure where the players each assume one of the original five characters?
4,I also found a really cool old module but you will need to message me so I can get it to you.
4,"[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10unBp0ARFwwaq-hf0M-5LbqlvzyOZ7za) is one I haven't even published yet.  I would love it if you would play test it and let me know what wasn't fun and how to make it more fun.  Don't just tell me how it stinks, tell me how to make it stink less and be more fun.  :)"
4,"[DMsguild.com](https://DMsguild.com) has modules and some of them are listed as ""Pay what you want"".  I have listed about a half dozen as pay what you want, under my real name, Alan Robinson.  Go take a look and see if you like any of my work. I don;t want your money; I want your constructive feedback on my work. There is also DriveThruRPG.com."
4,Perhaps you could play a character with a different religion someday.  Maybe a Hindu or a Muslim.  It is a great opportunity to look at the world through the eyes of someone with a different religion.
4,"The rules are less important than having fun.  Just pull a group of people together and tell them a story and let them do whatever they want within the story and you just narrate what they do and what the consequences of their actions are.  Use whatever rules you are familiar with but don't open up any manuals during the game and keep the pace of the game from slowing down too much.  Keep things lighthearted and fun.  You can learn the rules between games, but again, the rules are not as important as having fun in a social and interactive environment.  Here's wishing you the most fun creating group memories!"
4,Excellent!  I do so enjoy hearing about people having a good time while role playing.  Here's to many more years of building memories with like-minded people in a social setting.
4,"Instead of working too much on structure, I would just create a world and let the characters walk around and discover things in whatever order they choose and try to give them as much control as you possibly can.  I know it's difficult, but you need to be prepared to describe whatever situation the party finds themselves in.  You will need to wing it and ad lib constantly.  It takes practice, so don't lose hope.  All you have to do is give a dramatic, theatrical description of the environment in which the characters find themselves and then describe the actions they choose to take and the consequences of those actions."
4,"Just make sure that they know that it's no fun wining every roll or losing every roll.  The fun is in the combination of great, good, medium, low and crappy rolls.  Don't get upset because you rolled a Nat 1; it can still be a fun experience."
4,This is what I have done in the past: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/280759/World-Atlas-of-Rodinia?term=world+atlas+of+ro
4,"Yeah, you certainly don;t have to do so, but I have done so in the past and it turned out pretty cool: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/280759/World-Atlas-of-Rodinia?term=world+atlas+of+ro"

4,"Legends are an excellent opportunity to compliment a map with colorfully descriptive text.  No, it's not required at all, but it's a beautiful thing when it is done well."
4,That is fascinating!  Someone need to hire a shipful of sailors to investigate where these ships went.
4,"First, you should try to talk to him one on one, so he doesn't feel like he's being cornered by everyone else.  Second, you should try to be as calm and matter-of-fact as possible.  You should explain to him that you are no longer having fun and tell him exactly why.  If he changes his behavior, fine, keep playing.  if not, then you go join or form another group somewhere.  It's as simple as that.  If you are not having fun, then why are you still playing?"
4,Apologies.
4,Any game that requires sanity rolls rates high with me.  :)
4,"It's called DCC, or dungeon crawl classics.  You start out at Level 0.  Typically 1 or 2 HP.  You are allowed to select 4 pre-gen characters from a pile.  The low HP of each character guarantees that they work together because they have to in order to survive.  Don't get too attached to your characters, though; they don't last long.  I lost one of mine because he fell into a 1-foot-deep pit and somehow managed to hit his head on the edge of the pit.  1 point of damage.  Dead.  Actually, we decided to start a campfire in the very first room of the dungeon, which produced a bunch of smoke, which caused us all to roll to see if we get choked out.  Once of the characters choked out and died minutes into the dungeon crawl, right in front of the stairs leading us down."
4,"I believe that adamantine weapons always crit when they hit.  I recall it is very, very expensive to make an adamantine weapon."
4,"If it's in hell, maybe they have 6-inch-long bedbugs."
4,"There is a role playing game named *Call of Cthulu*. You should check it out because it might give you some inspiration for scary stuff to throw at the characters.  Also, an Oblex can create replicas of people, even down to the memories."
4,"You knowing the reference makes me feel better, thank you, my lungs are unclenching now."
4,<putting my face in my hands>Oh my god.  How old am I?  My peers don't get Gilligan's Island references.  Have I entered some event horizon that impacts the passage of time?
4,Make him sound like Mr. Howell from *Gilligan's Island*.
4,They have been pretty bad here in the midwest for the last several years.
4,I flew into Dallas Fort Worth Airport a few years ago; everything really is bigger there!
4,"Yes, but especially in a desert.  The players need to feel a sense of the physical presence of the sun, hour after hour, unrelenting, driving you mad with the heat..."
4,The first *Red Roof Inn*?  I don't think he necessarily has to be so powerful..
4,"I try to engage all 9 of my audience's senses: sight, smell, sound, touch, taste, time, distance, direction and danger/doom.  I think desert adventures are less than interesting because storytellers do not spend enough attention to the audience's sense of time."
4,"There's a lot of content out there.  Your work has to be really, really good.  Your formatting has to be perfect.  You need artwork and maps.  And you need to advertise your work in Twitter and Facebook."
4,The function reminds me of a vampire.
4,Yeah.  I've made a few bucks.  Like about $13.  Making any real money is a huge investment in time and money.
4,DMsguild will pay you 50%.
4,I'd love it if you would play test it and give me some feedback.  I want to know what wasn't so fun and how to make it more fun.
4,[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10unBp0ARFwwaq-hf0M-5LbqlvzyOZ7za)'s something I have been working on.
4,"Think about it this way.  The lich was a keystone predator in his area; now that it is gone, something else will rise to occupy the vacuum left.  Maybe one of the lich's lieutenants or followers?  Maybe a cult that worships some monster?  Maybe a religion with a crystal cathedral?  Maybe an extremist political bloc?  Who's going to take the lich's place?"
4,"[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10unBp0ARFwwaq-hf0M-5LbqlvzyOZ7za) is something I have been working on.  It's about an oblex building a dungeon full of traps to test for intelligent prey so it can eat.  Are you ""edible""?  Will you get invited to dinner?"
4,"<feeling sense of victorious satisfaction>

""The owner of this ring is an ambassador to the nation of <insert name of nation here> and, as such, has diplomatic immunity; please give the ring back to its owner and release him.  Thank you for your cooperation.  -<insert name of noble here>""

4,"*""Do Not Read By Penalty of Curse"".*"
4,"Gather your list of scenes in which you will put the party, gather your NPCs and your maps and get ready to warm up your storytelling skills."
4,I found my group on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com).
4,"Role playing is a game.  Games are meant to be fun.  If you are not having as much fun as you could be having, yes, it is time to stop and address the issue.  I hope you can help him integrate better, but, if not, do him a favor and cut him loose so he can go find a group where he fits better.  Both you and he deserve to be in groups that work for you.  Happy playing!  :)"
4,[Here](https://www.dndbeyond.com/forums/dungeons-dragons-discussion/rules-game-mechanics/12823-limits-to-command-spell) is something you might want to read if you haven't already.
4,"I think a battle for the stone would be great.  However, battles with lots of PCs and NPCs can get bogged down easily, so you would need to read up on how to keep combat pace fast."
4,Sounds like fun!
4,I thought Austin Powers was great. I see Demi Moore's name in the credits for all 3 of those movies.
4,"Also, I am reminded of the SNL sketch *Lothar of the Hill People*.  It would be funny if you could incorporate some of that into your backstory."
4,Halflings live in hills.  Maybe he was brought up somewhere where there were lots of halflings as well as dwarves.  How many siblings does your dwarf have?  Are his parents still alive?  Both of them?  What kind of schooling or training has your dwarf already had?  Has your dwarf traveled at all?  Does he play a musical instrument?
4,That is some good work!  I like this map!  I could create adventures around this map.  My only criticism is the handwriting is very difficult to read.
4,"Tell him that his behavior is causing other people to not have a fun time.  Give him specific reasons why.  If he persists, tell him that his style of play is in conflict with your group and ask him to leave.  It is as simple as that.  Only the DM should approach him and no one else.  Approach him in private, between games and very respectfully and compassionately.  Offer to show him alternatives to the way he is playing.  Don't get emotional, be matter-of-fact about it."
4,"From now on, everyone in your game rolls dice in the open, in a designated dice-rolling area."
4,[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1lxxup/i_need_some_good_riddles_for_dd_any_subject_any/) are some riddle resources.
4,The last page in [this](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10unBp0ARFwwaq-hf0M-5LbqlvzyOZ7za) document has a list of some wonderful traps.
4,"Absolutely.  And, if they are having fun, they don't care if you're winging it."
4,That is a shame.  I know it can be frustrating but he needs to discover the fun in it.
4,"Perhaps you could wait until the dragon comes down to the bottom of the mountain instead of climbing the mountain.  You know, draw him out somehow."
4,Got sherpa?
4,"This just looks like adventure after adventure, just waiting to happen!  This map needs a legend, stat!"
4,I would consider giving the players a few of their spells back and leave BBEG's HP alone.
4,"At first sight, it seems to me to be somewhere between difficult and impossible."
4,"Unless the owner of the store wants to lose business, he/she/they should make some kind of effort to discourage loitering outside the store."
4,We need to figure out how to show a player that winning all your rolls or losing all your rolls is no fun; it's the random combination of the two.
4,<suspiciously peering around at everything in this room>
4,A big shield?
4,"I recall playing a D&D adventure module named *Temple of the Frog*, which had frog soldiers carrying both laser pistol and laser files!"
4,What if every book in the place were a mimic?  :)
4,"Unfortunately that appears to be the case.  If playing that particular character is that important to you, you may have to bounce and find another group or else create your own group.  It's not easy.  Not every group plays the same way and none of us are compatible with all groups.  It's kind of like speed dating; you want to determine quickly how compatible you are, so, if you are incompatible, you can move on to the next group ASAP."
4,"I love the uniqueness of the map location!  If I were you, I would generate a few stat sheets for the librarians.  You could even generate a dramatic descriptive history of the institution."
4,Then your two choices are to accept things the way they are or else find another group.  How important is it to you to win this argument?
4,"The DM is the referee; the call is their to make.  But if you are not having as much fun as you might otherwise be having, then you need to have a discussion with the DM.  If you're really not having fun, then you're missing the entire point of playing a game and you should probably go try to find another group."
4,"I enjoyed the creative process.  I've published it and listed it as ""Pay what you want"".  I think it's made me maybe a dollar, not much.  But I did it just to create a unique world.  Mine is actually a super-continent that existed here on Earth, about 5 super-continents before Pangea."
4,"Some worlds have developed explosive powder and some haven't; it just depends upon which world you are adventuring in.  As far as mechanics, I would just make an explosion do damage similar to a [*Fireball*](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Fireball#content)."
4,That there map needs a legend.  I took about 8 maps and made a legend for each and suddenly I had created an [atlas](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/280759/World-Atlas-of-Rodinia?term=rodinia).
4,Sorry if I misunderstood.
4,"Where's the over-the-holder beholder holder?

Seriously, nice work; those teeth of his have me freaked out.  They look small but painful, like my Boston Terrier, Hank."
4,"Honestly, I would not sweat stats and point distribution so much.  I would be more concerned about role playing someone who doesn't have a natural ""18"" for every attribute.  I would role play someone who has to learn to be effective within his/her limitations.  I don't enjoy games where I succeed every roll, or conversely, fail every roll.  I like there to be a mixture of the two and that is best achieved with moderate attribute values, not extreme ones.  I'm sure there is a name for this theory and I don't know it yet.  I think the opposite of this concept is dubbed ""min-max""?"
4,"<blush>  Nah, just creative and found an outlet for that creativity, that's all.  I love creating maps and modules and sh@t.  It doesn't make me much money, I just enjoy making my visualizations come to life.  And people like you help to make that happen."
4,You are free to use some or all of it; I like to spread creativity around.  :)
4,"I had kind of a breakthrough with my Inkarnate art yesterday.  I've never done work that detailed before.  I put bottles on the shelves in the storage room.  There is even a big jar of pickles there.  The dining tables have plates of food and goblets of mead on them.  There are colored glass candle holders on all tables, on the bar and even a line of them along the front edge of the stage.  And I imported a hardwood floor image.  It looks pretty sharp.

I recently created a module that just describes a tavern I invented in my mind, named ""The Farting Beholder"".  It has a funny menu, a list of things to do while you're there, it has its own corporate logo and I even have created monster stat sheets for the owner, the bartender, the bouncer, the cook/waiter and even a few regular customers.  I have been wanting to create a blueprint map for the tavern and I think I now feel able to do so.  It will look a lot like the map I just shared with you.  But I need to put a mechanical centaur in somewhere.  :)  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_sNYyAxiVrOLwrIRlMqxJHmBFCY_yOeQ

Let me know about any other maps you require.  Thanks!"
4,Wrong copy; try this one: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IQILAaAfuiX33DocknvdzrmtRnqCBkBd
4,I did some more work on this map: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x3qCUeBD2Tr2g7dwyl8G0kbzAmT3qo3x
4,It's different from how anyone does it.  I usually get yelled at when I mention it on this Reddit.  Maybe I don't word it properly; you seemed to understand.
4,"I love doing this stuff just for fun.  Let me know if you need help with anything.  Until then, have fun!"
4,"I have a radical view of experience.  I feel that, if your character makes an ability check, fails and tries the same check again, they should get 1 or 2 experience points just before their second attempt.

The whole idea is that showing off your high skills gets you nothing and neither does failing and giving up.You only get experience if you try something, fail, and try again.  That puts that amount of experience the characters get right in the hands of the players.  Let them reward themselves experience.  Outsource that shit.  It's less for the DM to have to monkey with.  I also reward teamwork, creativity and humor/puns with extra experience points."
4,"You really didn't ask about maps so sorry if it threw you off.  People seem to love maps.  You can find some map making software, if you want to add that dimension to your adventures.  There is even free software that will generate a random map."
4,Then he is interfering with the camaraderie we all cherish and are looking for.  You owe it to him to either give him that experience or else cut him loose so he can find it somewhere else.  And he owes it to you to take your suggestions and try hard to not interfere with the fun or else he should try to find a group with which he would be better suited.
4,You can make maps: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BBLAzIyCawlw7VzJLqmyoprYmDQYwn8q
4,"I'll live.  If you need a replacement trap, check the last page of the document, the bibliography.  I kept a list of the places where I got trap ideas.  I found an image of the silhouette of a centaur.  I just opened it up in Microsoft Paint and added the carousel leg in the center.  Then, I imported it into Inkarnate.  I did the same with the red oblex color, the pile of gold, a bear trap, etc."
4,Have all the songs queued up and ready to play on speakers for your players to laugh at and sing along with.  I even put a f&&in' mechanical centaur on the f&&in' map!  How unique is that?
4,"[Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dV2ypN9ktyFTGfS6WGt8FaQjxYlTV7sZ) is a document.  It gives simple instructions on how adventures and campaigns are structured and how to break them down into components that aren't so overwhelming.  And there is an example campaign in the document, complete with a list of adventures.  Each one is a different theme.  Maybe this will give you some inspiration and guidance.  I'm also getting better at making maps using Inkarnate Pro."
4,Here is another effort on the tavern/inn: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BBLAzIyCawlw7VzJLqmyoprYmDQYwn8q
4,"There's no way around this.  You need to confront him, in private, between games, politely and in person.  Tell him that you are not enjoying your games and tell him why.  Don't get emotional, be very mater-of-fact about it.  See what he says.  If he asks for another chance, give it to him, if you choose.  But you're the DM.  The decision to cut him is ultimately yours.

You aren't getting paid to be a DM.  You do it for fun.  So, if you're not having fun, you either need to fix the reason why you're not having fun or else just not play anymore."
4,Here is the most recent copy I have.  I have been working on expanding the text description of each room.  The map legend has increased in size from 4 pages to 11 pages.  Please play test this and let me know what you think.  Thanks!  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cYKfympYT8PDdESqG2M_IkpaXp19kH1E
4,"Some people are just control freaks.  Let him have as much fun and control as you can possibly give him, but don't let him interfere with anyone's good time, including the DM.  :)"
4,"Take *that*, rat's ass!"
4,"I wish I had just paid the $5 per month instead of the $25.  But oh well, what's done is done.  I am going to try to get as much value out of the $25 I paid as I can."
4,"The pro version gives you access to lots more images.  You can also import images, as well.  You can pay $5 per month for Inkarnate Pro or else you can pay $25 for a year of it, which is what I did.  I am trying to get my money's worth out of it.  I am very happy with the last several maps I have done.  The most recent one is a one-level dungeon built by an Oblex and filled with traps."
4,What a great story.  People love it when you tell stories and not just children.  You must be good at it.
4,"Untrimmed bush or a landing strip...?  Okay, I am jumping off this line of suggestive messaging as it is not D&D related.  :)"
4,That changes nothing.  The venue is unsuitable for what you are trying to use it for.  Either you will have to find a new place to play or else you will need to suck it up and deal with what you have.
4,"What I am saying is that I have known some nasty unwashed nerd women, too.  It's not fair to just accuse men."
4,"Maybe introduce a spell named ""counter counterspell""."
4,"Not fair to accuse just men.  I have known stinky women as well as men.  Yes, I would be very discreet about it, but yes, it needs to be addressed."
4,"Sounds to me like you need a new venue.  Your current one sounds too small, too stuffy and you can smell the other players and you shouldn't have to do that."
4,Perhaps you could bring a fan.
4,Ever tried skeet shooting?  Pull!!
4,"Can you say ""rage issues""?  I know you can..."
4,Some people stink even when they bathe. I once met someone who has to shower 3-4 times every day otherwise she reeks.  It is such a burden for her.  Perhaps you can arrange to sit far away from him.
4,"I know I said I was done for the day but I did some more work on the inn map.  I made the floors wood, I made the interior walls wood, I put in a stage for karaoke and a fireplace.  I also put grass on the ground outside the place.  FYI, I created a tavern named ""The Farting Beholder"", which contains a mechanical centaur!  Here is the most recent copy of the map; it is starting to take shape. See you later tonight!  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PE1nwnotoXq99AYu-5rkMU3QTzOKCGOY"
4,Become the founder of the world's first *Discount Shoe Warehouse*.
4,"Like I said, it is just a very rough draft.  We can certainly refine it.  We can even add grass on the ground outside the place.  We could even create a map for each floor of the tower you mentioned.  It all just takes time.  Talk to you later!"
4,Sorry: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yKvO84XbtNl5LP68lXlSU64nboOAKkRX
4,"Here is a very basic map of a tavern/inn I just whipped up in about 60 seconds.  It has tables and chairs, a long bar, a front door and multiple sleeping rooms behind the bar.  Let me know what you think and if this is even close to what you had visualized.  We can import a few types of images, if you want to, but we need to keep that number as low as possible.  I will check back in with you later this evening."
4,"I have a Bachelor's in IT but I have absolutely no idea how to use Discord.  I don't need to be repaid.  I could just try to create a basic map of an inn, taking just a few minutes and then share it with you and you can ask me to make whatever changes you want.

I am happy to help.  I really enjoy the creative process."
4,I could make you a nice in map using Inkarnate Pro some time.  But it's about time for me to get to work.
4,I think we probably need to come up with a general outline for the adventure and then create a map to support that overall concept.  I use Inkarnate Pro to make my maps.
4,"You should look at television shows and movies and check out WHY and HOW people are tortured and killed.  As far as the ""guards"", you'll need to come up with a general concept and then create either a character sheet for each or else a monster stat sheet for each one, including the BBEG."
5,"Remove proficiency in Common from races with specific racial languages.

You can still pick Common up with certain features or backgrounds on by training it in downtime, but only Humans get it for free. You can apply this to monsters/NPCs as well to increase immersion; many inhabitants of a Dwarvish citadel will have picked Common up from trade routes, but more insular Goblins or Wood Elves probably wouldn't have. All of a sudden translation matters, and the party won't have access to a dozen different languages for free. It's also extremely clean to implement, requiring no additional mechanics, and should have the side benefit of making disparate racial cultures feel more unique.

Thoughts? Experiences with similar language ""fixes""?"
5,"Cut my teeth on 2nd, spent most of my time in 3rd, and have recently run a few games in 5th. Never touched 4th. But it's been recommended to me to look at its Monster Manuals, which led me to dig into the core rules a bit... and now I'm thinking about doing my next campaign in the 4e system. Why shouldn't I? Stop me before I do something I'll regret!"
5,"The author describes some issues with the table in the DMG [here](http://blogofholding.com/?p=7283), and provides a replacement set of formulae [here](http://blogofholding.com/?p=7338). Cool stuff, with excellent data points and analysis. You can't quite cut and run with the numbers since things like proficiency bonus, ability scores, armor type, etc. will have to balance out, but looks like a super useful tool!"
5,"What ""barrier/shield"" does the Wizard cast?"
5,That'll take years. Most campaigns span only weeks.
5,"If the player gets pregnant, I don't see why their character would be affected."
5,They aren't mutually exclusive. Are you *seriously* going to argue that there's no sexual element? With a straight face? Come on. We're not idiots.
5,Tolkien predates D&D and is a much larger cultural phenomenon. Elrond was featured recently in two separate three-blockbuster movie series. Everybody knows Lord of the Rings. Most of my coworkers haven't even heard of D&D.
5,"Because of Tolkien, Elrond Half-Elven, and the tale of Beren and Lúthien. Not because somebody wanted to talk about deviant sexual behavior."
5,"Let's PLEASE try to keep fetishes away from the table. PLEASE.

Also, your and you're are not interchangeable."
5,"Okay, be charitable. It's obviously wrong, but it's not a lie -- just a mistake. There's no intent to deceive."
5,"You can roll as high of a deception check as you want to; without evidence to the contrary, they still know that their friends are on their side and don't hate them. And if you do succeed in making them question that, they'll generally talk about it, rather than wrecking house. Ogres are probably an exception to the latter, but charms still don't get to determine behavior."
5,"When you ask, they'll likely say ""no"". There's a difference between *charm monster* and *dominate monster*."
5,When has this been asked?
5,"Also, if you ever run a game for another DM, they'll be familiar with lots of the monsters. And if they're a good player, you'll notice that it doesn't pose any sort of an issue."
5,"Youkai? Touhou?

Is there some reason why you're having trouble with the DMG's monster-creation procedure? [This](https://theangrygm.com/series/custom-monster-building/) is a really good walkthough of it, if you need one."
5,"Looking it up is not metagaming, it's reading a book. Giving the knowledge that you get to your character *is* metagaming, as your character has no way to detect HP or know if you're fighting anything other than a literally average cycle."
5,Hmmm
5,"So stop hand-holding, and make them dead. What's the downside?"
5,MIRABAAAAR
5,How very original of her!
5,Wait -- which is it? Druid or Barbarian? Or are you planning to multiclass them? How do you want the character to operate mechanically?
5,"Not all environmental features are created equal. Somebody using a piton instead of their perfectly serviceable battleaxe or putting a box on their head for ""cover"" might be absurd, but they don't make for interesting combat. Shoving somebody into a fireplace or pit trap does.

To be interesting, fights really need to be tactical. Are you presenting your players with strategic choices? Do you have archers blasting away from behind a beefy frontline? Do you have assassins slinking around dark and cluttered three-dimensional environments? Do you have spellcasters locking up their melees so that the backliners get overrun?"
5,"Sorry somebody cheated on you. Really, though, this has nothing to do with D&D."
5,"The monster would need to be CR 5 or so. Depending on the build, a variety of levels could create a CR 5 monster."
5,Furries =/= gnolls
5,"> there was no other option

lol"
5,Why?
5,"The PHB prices vary widely and lead to many different types of GP values. Perhaps I should have used a day-labor base: a common workman makes 1GP for a full day of work, whereas in modern America they might make around $80. So that would make the 50GP bribe equal to $4000 USD, twice what I originally spotted up. Would that be more amenable to you?"
5,What would you prefer?
5,"Played it an awful lot considering you hate it so much, hmm?"
5,"It's clear that you never played it. Which is fine, but maybe you should leave the commenting on it to people who have."
5,"Yeah, $2000 USD seems like a pretty high starting point"
5,"Sounds like you're looking for 3rd, then. 4e and 5e are both combat simulators with limited mechanics for other types of challenges."
5,What do your sessions generally consist of? What do you enjoy about D&D? How powerful/important do you want the characters to be?
5,This comes with the added bonus of removing player gratification so they can stop pretending to be sleazy and start playing the game with everyone else.
5,"The players generally have to tell the DM what their characters do. ""I roll to fight the goblins"" doesn't cut it, and neither does ""I roll to seduce"". What is the character *actually doing*?"
5,"You effectively can't, unfortunately. The Doctor isn't level 1."
5,"D&D is **the** tabletop adventure RPG. You create a character who can go fight monsters and win fame/power/glory/money/whatever. It'll be one of the most freeform games you've ever participated in. Play at the table is a combination of strategic decisionmaking, improvisational roleplay, and small-scale tactical wargame combat."
5,"> browine

The alcoholic beverage of choice for me and the bros"
5,"This game doesn't normally have much, if anything, to do with coitus. Most players want to keep it that way. Do yours not?"
5,Those are your circle spells.
5,"> In some realms, your party is the ONLY group of Heroes in the world.

While this may be true in isolated instances, it's far from the default assumptions of the game -- see 3.5 DMG 138ff."
5,"It tastes like styrofoam and is bad for you long-term

Second-tier Clerics are somewhat rare

Their deities grant them different spells

They need to use their slots for different things

Or any other reason/combination of reasons you can come up with. Personally, it seems reasonable to have starvation be a little less pressing of an issue than it might ordinarily be."
5,"Since you aren't a politician or otherwise working with policy, don't worry about being politically correct, politically incorrect, or politically anything else. Playing the game is not inherently political. Certain characters and monsters may be involved in in-world politics, but that doesn't really have anything to do with the players' assumption or non-assumption of accents.

> Edit: Could I get the opinions of not white men or women too? Dont identify if that makes you uncomfortable, I'm just less worried about their opinions even though everyone is making great points

This is a bizarre question/statement, and frankly pretty concerning. Why should people's skin color matter? Everyone has an ethnic background, and the most stereotyped fantasy accent is one associated with a light-skinned ethnic people."
5,"But your question was if there's a difference. There is. It might not come up often, but it's there."
5,"Yes. A **hill giant** is only CR 5 and is a common monster is many campaigns, but its primary attack deals 3d10+5 damage, an average of 21.5. A 5th-level Monk will only be able to reduce that damage by 1d10+9, an average of 14.5, for a total average take of 7 damage.

It's not just one monster, either. Basically anything ranged can reach chip damage if it crits. A CR 1/4 **drow** or **goblin** or a CR 2 **wererat** can deal up to 14 damage with its ranged attacks. A CR 1/8 **guard** can do 13. A CR 3 **archer** could do 40 (!!). The list, obviously, goes on."
5,"Also, the Deflect Missiles feature only allows you to reduce the damage you take when hit by a ranged weapon attack by 1d10+DEX+Monk. You still take any damage rolled beyond that threshold. It does not cause the attack to miss or give you immunity to its damage."
5,"Dave Arneson most certainly did not invent the concept of roleplaying. Children have been playing ""house"" for millenia."
5,"Which, let's be honest, they needed to have kept for 5e."
5,"With this, *true strike* -> *firebolt* becomes a great slotfree engine. Still worse than burning slots, of course, but pretty handy nonetheless."
5,"Sure. But this isn't a sub for pictures of jails, either. It needs to have to do with the game."
5,Read the book. I recommend all of its pages.
5,Mightn't she get a bit chilly like this?
5,What does this have to do with D&D?
5,"Depends on the individuals, not just the species."
5,Depends on the individuals.
5,No

5,"What do you mean by ""character idea""?"

5,"Nope. You do not heal as a combat pattern or to recover from a fight, unless you don't know how the system works or are trolling. It's an absolute waste of spell slots and actions. The only efficient healing are *healing spirit*, Disciple of Life + *goodberry*, and arguably *prayer of healing*.

What you do use healing for is a cleanse of the devastating Unconscious condition. While useful and possible in many builds, it's not exactly traditional."

5,"Just prepare it, cast it, then prepare *wish* the next day. The **power** level of that combination is **over** the power level of simply knowing *wish* and any other 9th-level spell. Hence the user's comment that the spell is **over**-**power**ed."
5,No worries! This is a pretty complicated game and it's not always easy to get your head around it.
5,"I'm going to assume that you posted this so you can get feedback and continue to improve in your homebrewing journey. A general note about this subrace -- it has only advantages over the base race, with no drawbacks. You'll probably want to note which of the main Aarakocra features are replaced by new ones. For instance, there's no reason to use the Passerine fly speed of 40ft when you can use the Aarakocra one of 60ft, but you still gain +1 CHA in addition to the pre-existing +2 DEX and +1 WIS. More specific notes:

- At a mere 1 foot of height, its size would be Tiny, not Small. and its mechanics don't really back up the feel of a character the size of somebody else's head.

- It's also disturbingly heavy for its height compared to other Aarakocra.

- All characters are proficient with their unarmed strikes

- A character lacking self-control would likely have *lower* CHA, not higher. CHA doesn't represent cuteness or likability; it represents what the rules say it does: confidence, eloquence, and a commanding personality.

- Having ""Advantage on Charming"" is meaningless. You'll want to replace this with a feature which actually does something."
5,"Do you mean *charm person*? You don't roll a d20 when you cast that, so advantage wouldn't actually do anything."

5,"Get them to stop working out! They'll become less strong within a few months.

Or... did you mean the players' characters? Since their characters are at a higher level than the module intended, you'll have to scale up the encounters (NOT necessarily the enemies). Use [KFC](https://kobold.club/fight/#/encounter-builder) in combination with DMG 81 to determine how difficult the encounters were intended to be at the written level, and then add monsters until the encounter is at the desired difficulty for their actual level.

Note: are you sure you don't mean ""Demogorgon""? Saying ""the Demogorgon"" is kind of like saying ""the Fred"" -- they're both just a person's name, so attaching an article to it is kind of strange."

5,"Terrible marriage advice here, folks"

5,I'm sorry
5,"I wouldn't worry too much about the success % of an overall adventure. There's too many variables there to control -- and, again, success on such a scale is relative. Were I running that adventure, I'd look at my in-game calendar that I keep and see how much time there was between the pre-scheduled feast day and the current day. That's how much time they'd have, be it hopelessly little or easily enough. You may not do things the same way, though."
5,"Not necessarily. It's a sort of all-around small-scale success figure. It's how often you're expected to hit with an attack, beat a check, or save against an effect -- on average.

It's much harder to say if anything larger than that was a success or a failure, as there's usually at least a hint of each. For instance, a level 5 party could win a fight with 2 goblins at the cost of a *fireball*. Is that a success? They certainly won the fight, but they lost a vital resource. Was it worth it?"
5,Right side of the screen -> + RESOURCES -> Getting Started/Learning to Play
5,"Right. You have a Race and a Background. But the *default game*, in which you enter dungeons and fight dragons, doesn't contain any commentary on who your siblings were or at what age the town bully discovered his sorcerous talents. The players and DM can choose to go back to where someone grew up, but that requires that they work together to involve a backstory which wouldn't otherwise have mattered."
5,"If you get a critical hit, I'll allow the bonus damage to be swapped out for a location-targeted effect of my determination."
5,So you think that visuals are more important to the game than behavior?
5,"One is a 5e base class, the other is a buffed beta-test version of the same which was eventually scrapped for a variety of reasons."
5,Great way to attract more sorrowsworn
5,What's MGSV?
5,"I probably should have said that it's not part of the game *by default*. Nothing in the rulebook references it, for instance. While you can choose to have it become relevant, it won't do so organically, unlike Race, Class, Background, Equipment, etc."
5,"> On your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and **take one action**

(PHB 189, ""Your Turn""). A given character or monster might choose to move forward and attack, use the Dash action and retreat quickly, or use any other legal combination of abilities.

If a goblin falls unconscious, it'll be subjected to the Unconscious condition (PHB 197, ""Dropping to 0 Hit Points""), which prevents it from moving or taking actions or reactions, among other things. The remaining characters and monsters will choose what to do in light of the fact that one of the combatants has fallen.

> Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other

(PHB 189, ""The Order of Combat). Once one side has been defeated,combat ends and there's no need to proceed to the next round of initiative."
5,"I hear that. Sounds like this guy wants to write a book, not play a game. Which is great! He should go ahead and write it! But not at the expense of your character and the game."
5,"Definitely not. And there are parts of the rules that aren't clear. Thankfully, this isn't one of them. Go ahead and read what they say."
5,?
5,"It's your character, not his.

Also, it sounds like both of you are pretty heavily focused on this backstory. Remember that while fun, it's not actually part of the game. The DM may decide to read a piece of fiction that you wrote and seed certain characters from it into his world as monsters. If he chooses to do so, they're his characters, not yours.

But mainly, it sounds like you aren't on the same page. Link this post to him, and follow the [flowchart](http://i.imgur.com/EwiChyD.png)."
5,Hm
5,"No, I'm quite serious. There's a lot of reading that goes into playing this game. The rulebook, for instance, is 316 pages long. If a 10-page section on combat is difficult for you to understand, you'll want to practice so* that you can improve. Otherwise the game will be quite difficult for you to enjoy."
5,Pandemic comes to mind
5,"I don't mean to be rude, but you'll want to work on your reading comprehension. The rules certainly do answer what you're asking. Take a look at the ""Combat Step by Step"" sidebar on PHB 189. See also ""The Order of Combat"", ""Initiative"", ""Your Turn"", and ""Actions in Combat"". The rest of the chapter is also critical, so you'll want to become familiar with the whole thing.

Each goblin has 7 HP, as its statblock says. Nothing indicates that it would be different.

A group of 4 does not have 28 HP. They still have 7 HP. The HP do not combine.

The goblins will all attack on their turn, unless they use their action to do something else. They'll also likely move and take advantage of Nimble Escape to Disengage or Hide as a bonus action.

The PCs can choose to do whatever they want on their turns. If the goblins retreat, they can follow. They can attack any goblins that are within the range of their attacks."
5,"Re-read the Combat chapter of the rules. It has the answer to all of those questions. Also, if you're looking to respond to people in this thread, reply to their comments. Don't reply to your original post, as the commenter won't be notified and the comment chains will end up out of order."
5,"The design goal for 5e is a 65% success rate. I prefer around 55%, but it should probably be between half and three-quarters for most groups. Some tables may prefer less success, and that's okay too."
5,"You can visualize your character, sure, but how they act is a much larger part of play at the table than what they look like."
5,"They don't really ""look"" at all, since you can't see them."
5,"I wouldn't necessarily shift their ethical alignment for this. Chaotic Evil isn't ""extra +2 Evil"", it's Chaotic and also Evil. So if you're going to change the PC's alignment (which is well within your rights), just push it towards Evil, unless they also did something that was to the benefit of the individual against the tyranny of society.

Now, killing somebody who hadn't done anything deserving of death is certainly Evil. Drow tend to be Evil, but aren't innately so, and most people know that. As such, they deserve to be put on trial before being executed. If they haven't done anything worthy of execution, killing them is Evil. But, due to the mitigating factor of Drow being hated and often Evil, and the Drow being involved in criminal activity, I'd only bump the character's moral alignment down by one (say, from NG to TN).

By the way, who does the PC typically worship? How might they feel about the act?"
5,Then why pick the race?
5,"I'd want to use my actual stat block that I'd worked for in such an encounter. Maybe the characters could acquire a golem to fight with them, though."
5,"I'm more interested in why people choose to draw them with the tails. Like, there's no reason not to, but there's no reason *to* either. Right?"
5,Whoah. Awesome map! What sort of level range are you looking to prep for?

Hitting a given target 0% of the time is frustrating

Do what works for your family. But honestly, if you're not very combat-focused, I'd stop playing a wargame and play something else that suits what you're looking for better."
5,"Sure, but what are you here to do? If it's to protect the town, getting word to them may be more helpful than throwing your lives away. If it's to get loot and glory, you can't enjoy either of those when dead. If it's to rescue someone, you may be able to secretly free them without attracting Big B's attention."
5,"Talk, run, hide, or all of the above. Do you really need to fight everything you come across? What are you in the dungeon for?"
5,"Ah, no, I'm sure you wrote them right. They're just for a TPP I'm not familiar with. Carry on!"
5,Grit points?? Trick shots???
5,"Perhaps the monster could cast the *darkness* spell. This doesn't line up with what I know of the seven sins, though. What are you referencing?"
5,The EK can't learn *compelled duel* since it isn't on the Wizard list.
5,I assume you already have *shield*?
5,"Most level 1 Fighter are not Human variants with 2 weapons, though. It's possibly to create a Fighter that outperforms a Monk at level 1, but most of the standard builds don't. The only standard exception is PAM, which spikes extremely hard at 1."
5,"That's true. It's usually also pretty easy to do. All characters are assumed to be religious, but only a few of them are imbued by a deity with clerical power. Multiclassing as Cleric just shows that a deity has chosen you for some reason or another -- the same way they would have if you were still 1st-level. If you wanted to multiclass Fighter, maybe you just spent some more time training with weapons and in combat situations, since killing the other guy before you die is desirable for adventurers. So on and so forth."
5,"They do very decent damage at 1st level specifically, since Martial Arts isn't resource-gated. They also keep up quite easily through the 1st tier with Flurry of Blows. They don't start to be outshone until level 5."
5,Roleplaying is making decisions in-character. Your character can make decisions regardless of whether their features come prepackaged or are taken from multiple packages (classes). And multiclassing often does not set you behind in feats; a Ranger 8 will gain more feats from finishing out the build in Rogue than they would from staying in Ranger.
5,We know how Hercules defeated the hydra and the Nemean lion. Surely the characters would have similar knowledge?

5,"Your entire post assumes that tweaking a **troll**'s regen means that your players are now playing ""in a homebrew"". Though again, the monsters involved aren't relevant. Players should roleplay (make decisions in character, NOT necessarily talk in character) regardless. That means that anyone passing a DC 5 Nature check will be burning trolls."
5,"> A monster is defined as any creature that can be interacted with and potentially fought and killed. Even something as harmless as a frog or as benevolent as a unicorn is a monster by this definition. The term also applies to humans, elves, dwarves, and other civilized folk who might be friends or rivals to the player characters.

MM 4, ""What Is A Monster?"".

Would you seriously say that using any NPC not listed in the book means that you're running ""a homebrew""? Children don't exist? Blacksmiths have to have 10 STR? The world doesn't have any high-level Clerics?"
5,"Now's your chance to tear up the world a bit. The party's NPC Wizard friend? He's found dead, his spellbook stolen, his soul unresponsive to resurrection magic. The High Temple of Pelor is defaced in the night, its Clerics eviscerated and its altar horrendously desecrated. The party begins to hear rumors of the landscape itself deforming in response to the demonic presence. Ideally (if you can get a player on board behind the scenes), one of the PCs is assassinated and replaced by the Quasit itself -- or one of its newfound minions -- in polymorphed form. It can then stay a step ahead of all the party's attempts to sniff it out. Will the heroes be able to locate the Book in time, or will the world itself become corrupted and become a new layer of the Abyss?"
5,"DMs creating monsters is part of the default game, not homebrew. Besides, you're talking about roleplaying here, which should be done regardless of the monsters used."

5,"Yeah, versatile is an almost completely worthless property"
5,That invective always seems so much more sincere as two words than as one
5,Tier 3 characters can do a lot of damage. Props for using the yklwa!
5,The problem here is that it *isn't* being applied equally here. The save associated with this particular spell isn't a save against damage.
5,"That situation only happens when both sides allow it to happen, though. And it's not wholly unrealistic; combat, especially small-scale combat, is often chaotic. I definitely agree that it's disappointing if every fight devolves thoughtlessly into a conga line, though."
5,"He should definitely be eating the enemies. Very thematic roleplay!

But you're right, it can't be allowed to heal him. Other characters don't heal from eating food, so his shouldn't be able to either. I see two valid ways to proceed; you can flavor the eating as part of the normal hitdice/shortrest ""lunch break"" healing, or you can allow him to use Hungry Jaws against corpses with its normal cooldown. RAW is unclear on the latter use, and I don't think it's the design intent of the feature, but allowing it shouldn't be gamebreaking, and will be relatively consistent with what you've done so far."
5,"Honestly, I see the ""conga line"" as a feature, not a bug. While it gets you your +2 (a much better way to do flanking than advantage, btw), it also gives the bonus up to your enemies. Maintaining a solid line of battle doesn't allow you to flank other creatures, but it also doesn't allow them to flank you.

That could be used strategically to further a high AC advantage, which is super thematic. The Roman legionnaires want to maintain formation and crush their enemies under the weight of their armored advance; the rampaging Orcs want to break up the enemy formation and turn the fight into a chaotic mess of flanking. That conflict in positional goals creates a lot of subtle tactics. Grouping up also provides cover, but increases vulnerability to AOE abilities.

Pros and cons. It's fascinating, and I don't want to eliminate it."
5,"Poison resistance, etc. is pretty nice, but generally you'd be taking Dwarf if you were planning to use Squat Nimbleness to mitigate the speed differential, and I'm not sure if double proficiency in Acrobatics is worth complicating the build to that extent."
5,"The spell doesn't mention the Warlock class at all, since you can get the spell without being a Warlock (as your character did). While it's a signature ability of that class, it's no more exclusive than *mage hand*, *firebolt*, or *toll the dead*."
5,Yep. A 1- or 2-level starting dip in Fighter is generally best for Blade Pact builds that don't use Hexblade and focus on DEX (or STR) over CHA.
5,CON proficiency is substantially more important than either of the other two mentioned benefits.
5,Heavy armor for non-Dwarves of this build is a trap; you won't have the STR to take advantage of it.
5,"Taking feats that you don't know if you'll benefit from seems unnecessarily risky, even if you start in tier 3.

For reference, if you ever need to know what a spell does, read its description. Spells always do exactly what they say they do: no more and no less. The description for *eldritch blast* says that you create 3 beams once you reach 11th level. Since 14th level is as high or higher than 11th (but not as high as 17th), you'll create 3 beams."
5,"Tangentially, what system are you using for this?"
5,Be one
5,"I don't understand anything you just referenced, but feats are much, much stronger than cantrips. Any caster would jump at the opportunity to take 3 cantrips and Resilient:CON over 4 cantrips."

5,"And I don't, but I think there's room here to add additional bonus fun and shore up the inherent weaknesses of the concept at the same time. Wouldn't any DM jump at that chance?"
5,"And my advice is that the concept is bad with a goblin, but could be good with other monsters."
5,"""Magic"" is the ""because I said so"" of reasons. I could see reasons for various weaknesses such as damage vulnerabilities, but not necessarily for this one. I think that OP's players are entitled to a consistent experience, so it's best if we try to provide something that can model that."
5,"Sure. There's nothing wrong with something being fun or whimsical. That's why I suggested replacing the goblin with a fey elsewhere in the thread. But there should at least be an excuse for it, as there is for mimics and kuo-toa. That excuse allows the players and their characters to engage with the creature, rather than just ""clicking through"" the encounter and waiting for the next one. What happens when they try to find out why all these goblins are doing this and they find out ""oh, I just thought it would be fun if the treasure ran away sometimes""? The players are let down. They stop believing in the world. And the R in RPG is left alone by the wayside."
5,"Not at all! Borderlands was made for that, and D&D wasn't. So it meets those design goals better. There's obviously nothing wrong with collecting ""loot"" in D&D; it's one of the default character motivations."
5,"Thanks for the response. I like homebrew too, I guess I just have different standards."
5,"That gets down the right path. The only reason D&D is fun is imagination: if you just want to ""shoot 'em and loot 'em"", you may as well play Borderlands. Lore, as you term it, is actually the *source* of the fun in this game, not a detractor from it."

5,"Oh sure, I realize why you have them there. But why is the ""*goblin*"" choosing to be there? Maybe some lord of the Unseelie Court is sending her **boggle**s to steal gold from the Material Plane to be used in some dark ritual?"
5,"What's the motivation of these ""goblins"" that you use?"
5,What would make this monster easier to critically hit?
5,"No, but I've played a fair amount of D&D. Sounds like this ""goblin"" would be casting *gate* to access the Abyss? A 17th+ level spellcaster would almost certainly have better things to do than flee from some murderhobos while holding a Santa-bag.

I mean, feel free to do what you want, but you'll certainly confuse any experienced players that you have with inconsistencies like this. D&D looks to establish a certain verisimilitude that must be lacking in games like Diablo.

Many players do NOT seek to emulate ""real life"" behaviors, they seek to emulate their favorite character. And I am not treating them differently, i am saying 9box alignment is a poor tool to help achieve either goal. 

>I think alignment is intended to broadly outline how a character is going to react / perceive the world around them.

6,"There are ~~three~~ four items/concepts in play here.

The **ability score** \- for a typical human each ability score has a range in the bell curve of 3 to 18. As superior adventurers, players abilities can be expended to the superhuman level of 20. That is just a numerical representation of for example ""How strong are you?"" but this number itself is rarely used in the game. Its purpose is mostly to determine:

The **ability score modifier** \- based on the ability score, you get a modifier that you add (or subtract) to the d20 roll. the modifier goes up as that actual ability score goes up, but not on a 1 for 1 basis. This is the number that the payer needs to use A LOT in the game.

**Saving throws** \- when bad things happen to characters, they can sometimes ""save"" themselves from the full bad effect by making a particular ""saving throw"" - rolling the d20, adding the appropriate ability modifier, adding their proficiency if the ability is one that they are proficient in, and then comparing that total to the Difficulty Class of the bad thing happening to them.  A spell has a DC based on the Caster's level and spell casting modifier, a trap has a DC set based on how dangerous it is, etc.

Then there are **ability checks** and **contested ability checks**. An ability check is used primarily for when the character is voluntarily trying to do something. the DM sets a Difficulty Class , the player rolls the d20, adds the appropriate modifier and attempts to meet or beat the DC the DM has set for success. A contested ability check comes when two beings are trying to use their skills in opposition to each other: one trying to grab the other in a grapple hold, the other trying to wiggle or break out; one character trying to be quiet and sneak past the other, the other wanting to perceive the situation around them to keep an eye/ear on their environment. In these cases, each being rolls the d20 and adds the appropriate skill modifier - the higher one succeeding."

>In play, it is useful when thinking about how a character would approach a situation rather than how the player would approach it.

This seems to be entirely circular premise.

>In order for me to role play my character so this artificial tag of alignment is appropriately descriptive, I need to have this artificial morality framework to tell me what my actions need to be,

And i still dont see how that is a benefit at the table."
6,"> You do realize that alignment can shift over time, yes? That as a character moves through the world (the story), their perspective of the world or conflict may change. 

So alignment is purely descriptive?  of current actions? beliefs?

How does that manifest itself as useful in the game?"
6,"even given your premise

> In a world where Demons/Devils, Slaad, Angels, and Modrons/Inevitables explicitly exist, **it is useful to know which side of the cosmic (or local) conflict a character sits.** 

the best way accomplish ""which side are you on"" is by putting a player character in a box with one of 9 tags alignment tags?

 that isn't all encompassing. 

but is descriptive. 

so when and where an how exactly is that useful at the table again?

6,">That's fine, and they are free to do so, but the core rules are  not trying to do that.

Are you sure about that? that the core rules are ""here - this game with artificial morality applied to your character and not an immersive realistic opportunity for role play.""

6,"see the thing is I don't think it is ever a good tool for doing what it is ""supposed"" to do at the table for player characters. if it doesnt do what it is supposed to do, then it is a bad tool."

6,that is my character!
6,"> Alignment doesn't work in the real world,  

PRECISELY.

I no know one who wants to play D&D to be bound by pointless arbitrary conventions. They want their fantasy role play experience to be ""realistic"" and as ""immersive"" as possible.

And I brought up the Dark Knight discussions because they exemplify how arbitrary and unrealistic the 9box system is for player characters. If people cannot quickly and easily identify how a particular alignment ""works"" for one fictional character, there is no reason to believe that they will quickly and reasonably agree on how it works for the player's fictional character."
6,">Of course it wouldn't work, and people argue.  Batman was created with real-world morality in mind.  He does not exist in a world where Good, Evil, Law, and Chaos were the fundamental forces at the inception of his reality.

to get back to your fundamental position here, you are presuming that players want to play in a game that has an artificial moral code and that they want to be bound by that game code and to feel like a Michael Morcock novel. my experience is exactly the opposite. 

players want the game world to feel REAL."
6,"The rational debate here IS ""9box alignment is a terrible tool for players"" 

your position was that the place that it was a good tool was for when characters are sitting around in a bar.

6,"even in that instance I dont think 9boxing a player character is a good or the best thing because my short hand assumptions about what you mean when you say ""chaotic good"" are going to be different than what short hand you mean when you say ""chaotic good"" and we have now deliberately introduced unnecessary assumptions. and if we scale back to the furthers possible generality about what we both have as our assumptions, how is such vagueness the most helpful way we could be sharing this information?"
6,"so i sit at the tavern  describing  my brutal throat slashing of the cultist as ""good"" because  CULTIST EVIL and removing EVIL from the world is GOOD and that helps the game ..... ? and is the BEST way to handle telling stories at the tavern?"
6,"again,

1. "" stock setting of D&D,"" doesnt exist.
2. whatever the DM may fiat for the NPCs of *their* ""stock"" D&D world does not apply to what the **PLAYERS** are bringing to the table for how *they* would apply *their* interpretations to *their* characters in the situations *their* characters find themselves."

6,"> Good/Evil/Law/Chaos do **not** have different meanings to individuals living in the stock D&D world. 

they absolutely DO or you wouldnt have endless arguments about whether the Dark Knight is CG, CN, LN or N or something else.

6,when is 9-box alignment for players EVER the best tool for the job?
6,the easiest way to keep players from using it improperly is just to not have it at the table in the first place.
6,">That being said, I don't know if we need this extensive a rant about it-- if you don't like it, don't use it.  If others like it, why yuck their yum, you know?

Its kind of like lead in your water. You may have drunk that lead filled water for years and not realized that it was bad for you till someone pointed it out. I don't know that anyone who thinks about it ""likes"" what the alignment for players actually does at the table."

They now become infamous. No one wants to deal with them. Lots of law enforcement scrying on them. And their only contracts coming from really really bad beings to do really really bad things, that if they do them will further the slide of their reputation. 

But really if you don't want to DM for a murder hobo or evil campaign. ""Welp, i am done with this campaign."" ASAP is the best thing you can do."

6,"if it is a prequel to a 5e game, you want to use 5e.

6,"A good background covers:

* Why is this character out in the world adventuring (with other people -  *you eddgelord lone wolfs)*
* How has the campaign premise crossed this character's path or is looming in their future?
* How does the character know at least one of the other characters?"
6,"Note there is a difference between d-u-**A**\-l and d-u-**E**\-l  : they mean different things and there are feats and fighting styles in 5e that use both words.

duEl wielding in D&D 5e, is using a weapon in one hand and no weapon in the other (but you can use a shield) . this is a Fighting Style available to some of the martial classes.  a longsword is a weapon that can be used with the duEling style. (this is with a single longsword because duEling applies only when you have a weapon in one hand and no weapon in the other. it also does not allow the use of the Versatile property of the longsword because duEling requires a weapon in only one hand and the Versatile requires both hands on the same weapon)

some weapons you can swing with one hand or you can grip it with both hands and swing it for more damage. these weapons have the Versatile property. a longsword has this property. however you can only use this property if you are using both hands to hold 1 longsword. you cannot hold 2 longswords and make use of this property.

anyone can **carry** 2 longswords, one in each hand. however you cannot attack with both longswords because in order to carry a weapon in each and and to attack with both weapons, both weapons need to have the Light property, which the longsword doesnt have. if you take the duAl wielder feat, you can have a weapon in each hand and attack with both weapons even if they do not have the Light property.

how the damage is calculated for each of these types of attacks also varies."
6,"A character sheet is merely a memory device and not some type of bible or tax form that will be going through seven layers of audits and for which you will be fined penalties and assessed late fees. 

If your character does not have a specific place for a subclass

6,"> basic information giving RP

you can give basic information through **narrative**. to make it interesting, include multiple senses, go for evocative descriptions rather than clinical specifics, identify the bits that make this unique, make the descriptions dynamic so the players/characters have to react, things are not just sitting around waiting for the PCs.

if you are doing information transfer through **role play** with NPCs, give the NPCs strong personalities, give them their own interests or struggles or secrets or fears through which they filter and see the world."

It absolutely DOES hurt the game.

Do you know how many campaigns have been ruined because people grabbed on to the 9box and claimed righteously ""But I am SUPPOSED to be a dickhead because I am CHAOTIC NEUTRAL"" That has been one of the biggest self inflicted poisons in the game since it first came out.

How many have been made unfun to to the point of collapse by Paladins thinking that they MUST be officious dicks because that is what LAWFUL GOOD is! (probably in the top 10 self inflicted noxious game outputs.)

How many people spent hours trying to figure out ""Does my alignment change from Lawful Good if I am crushed out on an Evil guy? How can it not? How can I still play her as Good if she is supporting someone evil? I don't want to be EVIL "" when they could have just been focused on creating a fun character to play.

6,"Geologically, many of the things that appear to be rivers are not ""realistic"" - real world rivers start in the high lands like mountains and hills, flow together in one direction into lower lands in valleys and lowlands always joining with other rivers and streams that are also seeking the lowest land, and then heading to the oceans, always only in one direction. Where there is flat land at the ocean juncture they may then spread back out into many fingers in a delta that may become huge over the millennia.

This looks like you have a lot of rivers that just kind of loop around merrily from one place to the other flowing in whatever direction, from the ocean to the ocean. For that to happen, there would need to be a lot of magic."

You can have someone cast Pass Without Trace which gives you a +10 to your stealth modifier. You could have a magic item like Cloak of Elvenkind which grants disadvantage to everyone's perception checks to see you.

6,"Rule number 1: don't put your party up against a single bad guy, the action economy (player's many chances to do stuff vs monster's one chance) means that in order for the battle to be challenging, the monster has to be HUGE in a way that will generally one shot players if he hits, which then swings the balance WAY to the monster's side. 

Your bad guy always fights with friends, or at least slaves that will fight for him. Think about using Minions - bad guys with only 1 hp that the party can take down easily but only by diverting resources from taking down the bad guy - you dont need to bother tracking HP, cause 1 hit and they are done. And if the party doesnt decide to take care of them, they provide a consistent, greater than nuisance level, source of pain and trouble for the party.

Rule number 2: Make it so the final encounter the bad guy team can call/send for help.  And you have support team off screen waiting. If the players are cutting through like butter, the help comes in fast and big and in quantity. If the players are struggling, the help comes slow and weak and in few numbers, or not at all."

6,"we partially agree on that. critical success has only ever applied in combat. a 1 on a combat attack roll is NOT a ""critical"" anything. it is just a miss. a plain old miss.

EDIT: oh, that also makes me realize that the 2d20 would up the power of high level creatures with multiple swings- now they will ""automatically miss"" only 1 in 100 times and not 1 in 20. (and correspondingly nerf low level creature's chances of hitting High AC since the automatic hit will only happen 1 out of 100 instead of 1 out of 20.)

You might want to re read the books. There is no ""crit fail"" anywhere. Just automatic miss if you roll a 1 for a combat attack roll. Skill checks can succeed on a 1 if you have enough mod and the DC is low enough."
6,">The reason I like this system is it makes long shot actual long shots. A Nat of any number, 1 to 20, by default is a 5% chance.

I call 5% chance a longshot.

And it doesnt matter that the Nat 20 will come up the same percent as a Nat 18 or a Nat 4 because nothing special happens on either of them. They are the same as all of the rest of the dice so it is a 95% to 5% difference. And that is a difference you can feel at the table.

If you don't know who the other players are to make connections with your characters substitute 3) What is one area of her life that she was exposed to many people from many different backgrounds?

* How has the campaign premise crossed your character's path or is looming in the future?

(side note: RAW two spiritual weapons cannot create flanking conditions because neither is a creature)

If you are using a grid ""When in doubt about whether two creatures flank an enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between the centers of the creatures spaces. If **the line passes through opposite sides or corners** of the enemy's space, the enemy is flanked.""

Spiritual Weapon generates ""a **melee** spell **attack**"" roll

Because a medium size creature is one square, only 1 square can be flanking ""opposite sides or corners"". The spiritual weapon and PC2 would need to be in the same square for PC1 to create flanking conditions for both PC2 and the spiritual weapon.

* Gimme that sweet sweet phat l00tz! Money! Magic items! Fame! Titles! Influence!
* Whodunit? Where ***is*** the Lost City of Mystery? What is behind that curtain? Go see the Forest of Floating Trees??? YES!

as explained otherwhere in this thread, any ""non magical dedicated healer"" is a complete delusion . Nothing short of magic can heal in the ways that would make the class playable - you are simply willfully pretending a magical heal is ""non magical"" for whatever reason. if you are doing that, you can make that same imaginary pretense for any existing healing class - it is not magic from the weave - it is a combination of herbs poultices and prayers i mean herbs poultices and wishes i mean herbs and poultices and pointed touches guiding the healing chi flow i mean herbs. herbs did it. the barbarian was cured for 80 HP in 6 seconds realistically and non magically BY HERBS.

And in order to fill every niche ""i want my magical healing to be pretenced away as non magical healing"" you will have MORE than 80 classes for every possible occupation."
6,">You wanted examples of space not filled by the classes, I gave you some examples

The healer space IS quite filled. 

It is not filled in the way that *you* would like, but it is filled in the way that is popular with most players. And the  ""heal and control spell"" option is easily filled within the current framework with a subclass - no need for trying to jam some new full class into space with already LOTS of alternatives."

And again, as 5e has determined ""classes"" - there should be a core class mechanic and enough lore and mechanic space for at least 2 subclasses built around that core and theme. I just don't see anything close to that space existing without trampling on existing classes/subclasses for a ""dedicated healing class"" which RPGs have been running away from for decades because the demand and desire for such is sooooooooooo small."

6,">So D&D classes can’t be niche because the canon D&D world is generic?

D&D classes cannot be niche because that is not the way classes function in D&D.

Classes are broad archetypes that allow multiple subclasses that in themselves are tropes and the subclasses are broad enough to allow multiple role play individual characters with varied characteristics within them."
6,">What you and I define as whitespace are very different

that may be the core of the disagreement

>Paladins make great 1v1 tanks with high damage output, but what if your not into the holiness that comes with the class?

The existing Oaths are only some into the ""holy"" and there is whitespace for more Oaths that are even less so. There is whitespace to create a Fighter subclass with nova damage, the same with Barbarian.

And with rules as written, the holiness oath itself means very little. your DM can easily agree ""yeah, you can role play this how you want.""

EDIT:

>Does a wizard cover the broad term of aoe? Sure. Does he do it like .. a demolitionist? I’d argue no.

I would argue that in the general fantasy adventure world of D&D, there is not sufficient activity for someone whose key CLASS feature is ""i blow shit up"". that is not viable. A saboteur as a rogue subclass ... definitely.

EDIT 2: That is kinda the whole flaw with the Ranger is that they did not coalesce around a good key class mechanic and then spin the subclasses off from that and to just move some of the things that had been done under Ranger before but don't fit under the new mechanic to subclasses of other classes where they fit better."

6,">no class is dedicated to healing

The reason there is no ***class*** dedicated to healing, is that after 40 years of playtesting, confirmed by 25 years of videogame testing, no one wants to play a dedicated healer.  

and no, there is not ""whitespace"" just because there is not *a specific class dedicated to healing*. Healing is well covered by the subclasses and it would be nigh on impossible to create a full class of healers that didnt trample on the existing healers in the game."
6,">The Doctor, not only is this a fun class but it fills the non-magical healing niche and does it well

It is absolutely  ""magical""  for someone to spend 10 minutes and be able to fix 60hp to the fighter, 70 hp to the barbarian , 25 hp to the rogue, AT THE SAME TIME.  You can pretend that it is not ""magic"", but that for damn sure isnt something that any doctor without magic could accomplish! I mean you can take wizard or sorcerers or warlocks and instead of saying ""they are magic"" say ""they are non-magical, just doing advanced physics.""

EDIT: 

> Another example of a class that fills a niche is [The Juggernaut](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDHomebrew/comments/copoa2/the_juggernaut_class_update_17_small_changes_and/).  

While it fills a niche, the problem is that it is such a narrow niche that it fails to be a class. The ""hey you, attack me!"" is a whitespace mechanic, but it is something that is better attached as a subclass to Fighter / Barbarian / Paladin or designed as a Feat than to claim it is a ""class"""
6,">Whether there is whitespace is entirely based on opinion.

almost all ideas for new classes trample on the existing classes and subclasses or are so niche as to not be a ""super archetype"" that allows multiple ""archetype"" subclasses that themselves are broad enough to allow a differing variety of characters play within the subclass in the fantasy adventure role play genre.

6,"> to claim that the vast majority of homebrews are bad with no real argument for that claim or evidence to support it isn’t a very well thought out idea.

6,"> I stated non-magical, key word being non meaning no or not. 

Yes, you stated ""non magical.""

Look at what magical healing in the game can do and tell me ""nonmagical"" healing can come close to that.

It cannot. 

Only by *being* magical healing but *falsely calling itself* ""nonmagical"" healing could a playable class be built around that concept. 

And, as we already know, healing is not a whitespace within D&D. There are lots of classes and subclasses that have healing as a core function of the class/subclass."

potentially, yes. 

Using Ready Action means that you are limited in what you can do on the trigger that you set - you can only do one Action as your Reaction.

You set your trigger to ""when my familiar has distracted Goblin A, I will hit the goblin with my staff. "" 

If the your familiar distracts the goblin but the goblin is out of reach of your staff, you cannot use your Reaction move and attack, you can only attack. So you don't get to attack.

If you have set your trigger and before your familiar goes, a goblin shaman casts a magic missile at you and you use your Reaction to cast Shield, you have used your reaction so when the familiar's turn happens, you will not have a reaction to use to Attack."

6,"Generally these "" After you bring her all the things the last thing that you remember is a explosion now all of you are separated  ""  aka ""BLAMMO! something happens over which you have no control"" scenarios are not greeted well by players - it is the bad kind of railroading that you hear people complaining about - ""lack of player agency"" -- unless you had peppered lots of clues up to this point so that the BLAMMO was not a surprise and the players could have taken precautions that prevented it.  So your premise would need to have an alternate option if the BLAMMO doesnt happen.

And almost always having players all separated into different spaces makes leading the game  a bitch for the DM trying to juggle what is happening in 3, 4, 5 different places and boring for the players because now they are sitting around doing nothing for all of the time you are DMing content for the people who are in other spaces.

Soooo if as a DM i picked up a couple of adventures, and this was the premise for the first one, I would immediately put it down to check out the other one as more likely being something I would rather run. As a player after hearing the premise of the first one I would also pass the other one to my DM as something I would most likely rather play.

The party has slain a few dragons over their adventuring career, the Monk/Ranger even took the opportunity to craft a special dragonforce gauntlet to better help fight off dragons, which happened at level 11 just as the party hit tier 3. Most importantly, this weapon gains its charges from the breath weapon of dragons. For those interested, [I shared the magic item here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/9c3w7j/oc_homebrewed_magic_item_perfect_for_dragonslayers/)

Just the other week, the party hit level 17, giving the Warlock access to his 9th-level Mystic Arcanum. He wants something versatile to get the most out of the spell slot, so he decides to take True Polymorph.

It was this combination of True Polymorph and the Monk/Ranger's Dragonforce Gauntlet that led to a beautiful moment of emergent gameplay. The Warlock, having realised that the gauntlet was charged by dragon's breath weapons, noticed that he could turn another party member into a dragon wyrmling of any species and tailor the charges inside the gauntlet by blasting the Monk/Ranger to better prepare for upcoming encounters. Now the party has an excellent combo that they can use in their downtime that encourages them to work more closely as a party whilst also greatly improving their overall effectiveness. As a DM, I was very impressed.

What other interesting tales of emergent gameplay have you experienced as DMs, especially over long campaigns?"
7,"In my setting, I like the creation of magic items to feel a lot more involved. As a result, I often have characters supply specific rare materials in order to create magic items. Sometimes these resources come from creatures directly (such as dragon scales or Umber Hulk chitin) but other resources are more traditional materials. Xanathar's Guide introduced some nice rules for such a system on page 129, but outside of Mithral and Adamantine, D&D 5e doesn't really mention many materials that are useful for creating magic items. So I decided to create my own magical resources for my setting and share some of them here. Hopefully, these are useful for inspiring your own work or perhaps you'll feel inclined to include them directly.

#Elven Gossamer

Many centuries ago when the Weave was stronger, the elves were capable of creating a type of magical silk that made incredibly tough armour and exquisitely comfortable clothing. Creating elven gossamer now seems impossible, so all sources of it are kept as prized possessions or looted from tombs and ruins. The Drow seem to have retained the ability to make a material similar to elven gossamer, sometimes called Dark Gossamer or Drow Silk. The Drow make this from spider silk and imbue the material with Lolth's dark blessing. However, any magic item creating with this dark gossamer permanently loses its magic when exposed to sunlight for too long.

Elven gossamer makes very strong light armour and can even supplement medium and heavy armour creation when combined with mithral. Additionally, most magic items created with elven gossamer are Boots and Cloaks of Elven Kind.

#Luminous Platinum

As the myth goes, luminous platinum was showered across the Elam Desert by the god of good dragons Bahamut. The god cast some of his own scales, some as large as buildings, and they crashed through the sand forming rich veins of this mystic metal. Due to its appearance, luminous platinum is often mistaken for mithral but luminous platinum is considerably denser and lacks the untarnishable nature of mithral. In ore veins, luminous platinum glows a faint blue, making it easy to spot in caverns.

Luminous platinum is highly prized for its use in arcane focuses. Some of the most powerful wands and staves are crafted using the metal and it seems to have an innate property connecting it to the weave. Due to its connection to Bahamut, luminous platinum wands are very popular amongst draconic sorcerers. In addition to arcane focuses, luminous platinum is sometimes minted into coins. These coins are known as ""Bahamut Scales"" and they have a value of 50 gold pieces. Due to their rarity and somewhat exclusivity to the Elam Desert, they are often kept as prized trinkets by nobles in other lands.

#Sentient Timber

Powerful and ancient Treants are created from some of the strongest nature magic found within the Weave. When slain, their timber can be used to create powerful magic items associated with nature, but it is equally useful for creating sentient magic items as the timber is already accustomed to containing a life essence. Due to most Treants being good-aligned, killing them for their timber is generally considered an evil act and many enchanters will refuse to use the ingredient in their craft. Rarely, a treant will willingly shed a branch from itself to reward loyal servants, most often powerful druids and other guardians of nature.

Sentient timber is often used to create druid focuses as well as wooden weapons and shields. Many of these magic items exhibit some form of nature magic within them. There is a popular legend of a powerful monk that would patrol forests armed with a sentient timber quarterstaff.

#Shadowed Iron and Shadowed Timber

Sometimes when crossings to the Shadowfell open, the dark energy seeps through and manifests inside iron ore veins or through forests. Both materials adopt a black colour and their ability to reflect light is greatly diminished. Due to its association with the Shadowfell, both shadowed iron and shadowed timber are seen as products of pure evil by many. Both materials are incredibly popular amongst followers of the Raven Queen as they seem to make superior holy symbols for her clerics and paladins.

Due to their ties to the Shadowfell, both shadowed iron and shadowed timber are ideal for creating magic items that benefit stealth or magic items designed to inflict necrotic damage. Magic items created from these materials seem to have a latent effect that induces depressions for their users.

***

Hopefully, these magical materials are inspiring for your own creations. I had a lot of fun writing them and using them within my campaign so far, it would be awesome if other DMs can benefit too.

If you have some interesting materials in your own setting, feel free to share them below and get a discussion going!"
7,"I'm currently drafting up the layout for an upcoming dungeon my players will be facing and I'm looking for suggestions for monsters to use inside.

For some more information, the Sorcerer is Lawful Evil, has access to summoning elementals and creating constructs as well as a tight contact with Tiamat allowing Abishai to summoned forth. Helmed Horrors are some of my favourite monsters (as the party already know) so they will absolutely be making an appearance.

7,"I am fleshing out the Swords of Fortune, one of my setting's factions, with additional NPCs and I would like to partly crowdsource the creative process. In summary, the faction is a Monster Slayer/Bounty Hunter guild leaving its members to vary wildly. There is more information on the guild itself below.

***

#What is the guild?

The Swords of Fortune were established in the decades after the Age of Dragons ended. At this point in history, the role of “dragonslayer” became totally symbolic with dragon sightings becoming increasingly rare as they were hunted to near extinction or driven off. The first hall was founded by Andriu of the North, Duke of Lordsgate, who was a powerful dragonslayer himself. He founded the faction with the initial goal of preparing against potential future threats and his paranoia of the dragons returning was well known.

Between all the halls belong to the faction, it is estimated there are as many as 800 guild members. Each member of the Swords of Fortune belongs to a hall. Most cities and large towns on the continent have a hall belonging to the guild. The hierarchy within the group follows a strict chain of command. Each hall is led by a Blademaster and they report to the Blademaster General. This title is held by the Duke of Lordsgate, a tradition that has remained in place since the formation of the guild.

The faction is very orderly and its hierarchy is absolute. Although they are Lawful Neutral overall, certain halls will lean more towards good or evil depending on the leadership at the time as well as the culture of the settlement the hall is located. Traditionally, Aurikfell’s hall is renowned for virtue as a result of the mountain dwarves innate tendency towards good.

Despite their nature of eliminating creatures they are not assassins and many members would be offended to be regarded as such. Additionally, members can only carry out missions against approved quarries and members will be punished for completing contracts not assigned to them.

#What am I looking for?

I'm looking for a short description (3-5 sentences) of an NPC or PC of your creation. Due to the nature of the guild, there are few constraints as to what this character may be, though if there are races/classes not presented in my setting I will change them to something more suitable.

If anyone has further questions about the guild, I am happy to answer them to the best of my ability.
"
7,"##Just how important is each ability score? Is one way more powerful than the rest? Can any of them simply be ignored?

On this subreddit and other forums, I frequently see discussions concerning the balance of each of the ability scores in D&D 5e. Most seem to suggest that Dexterity is overpowered and Intelligence is underpowered and that Charisma is way overused for spellcasting. I have always considered that the ability scores within 5e are fairly balanced, so I spent some time thinking just how useful each ability score in different types of encounter. 

The three encounter types considered are Combat, Social, and Exploration. The musings below are intended to be general and will not apply to everyone. It should be noted that encounter types can be (and often are) combined to produce unique experiences in sessions.

Each ability score will be marked out of 5 in terms of how generally useful it is in encounters.

***

#Combat Encounters

Combat encounters are the most common encounter type in D&D 5e, though the gap has certainly closed since previous editions. A combat encounter generally involves the party fighting against monsters without dying themselves.

**Strength (3/5)**: In combat, strength is used for melee attacks. The weapons that utilise strength (maul/greataxe/greatsword) generally deal more damage than ranged weapons or finesse weapons. Strength is also used for the best armours in the game with a strength score of 15 allowing unimpeded movement while wearing plate armour (unless you're a dwarf). In addition to weapons and armour, strength can also be useful for grappling and shoving other creatures which can be very beneficial to the rest of your party. Strength is also used for resisting these effects should your opponent use these tactics against you.

Strength saves aren't common at all, but they do come up against many beast-type monsters that have charge/trample attacks. Having a good strength saving throw is useful for avoiding the extra damage that can come from these effects.

Overall, strength is useful in combat, but a lot of what it achieves can be replaced with dexterity.

**Dexterity (5/5)**: Dexterity is an incredibly useful stat in combat. It is used for both ranged weapons and finesse weapons which makes weapon choice versatile for dex-based adventurers. It is also very popular amongst dual-wielding adventurers as many light martial weapons also have the finesse trait. Adventurers that aren't a Tortle or using heavy armour rely on dexterity for their armour class. Even adventurers using medium armour will want to have a 14 in their dex to ensure they are well protected.

Before combat even begins, each character uses their dexterity for their initiative check. The benefit of acting before your opponent is a great boon in combat and it is another reason why dex stands out. Dexterity also benefits a characters stealth, allowing the benefits of hiding during combat encounters. Dexterity can also be used to escape grapples and avoid being shoved, but unlike strength it cannot be used to initiate such attacks.

Dexterity saving throws are also incredibly common, a lot of monster abilities and spell effects call for dex saves meaning that players may want to think twice before dumping dex.

**Constitution (4/5)**: Hitpoints. Everyone has them and no one wants to run out of them. In addition to hitpoints, constitution saving throws are common against effects that deal poison or necrotic damage. If you're battling undead, being able to resist their hitpoint draining abilities is incredibly useful, making constitution even more relevant in undead-heavy campaigns.

Rarely is constitution an adventurer's highest stat, but it is almost always 2nd or 3rd.

**Intelligence (1/5)**: Unless intelligence is your spellcasting ability, this ability score is rarely important in combat encounters. Intelligence saving throws come up rarely against creatures like Mindflayers, but for most adventurers Intelligence saves will be a rare sight indeed.

**Wisdom (3/5)**: Wisdom saving throws, like dex and con, are some of the most common saving throws. Any effects that target your mind can be warded off with a successful wisdom saving throw. In addition to a common saving throw, a good wisdom score benefits perception and makes it harder for creatures to use stealth against you in combat. Do you have an unconcious ally that needs to be stabilised? Wisdom is used to stop them dying out.

**Charisma (1/5)**: Much like intelligence, charisma rarely comes up if it isn't used as your spellcasting ability. Charisma saving throws are uncommon, though slightly more frequent that int saves. If you want to be avoid being banished, possessed or affected by Bane, a charisma save is required.

***

#Social Encounters

Social encounters, like combat, come in many different forms. They can range from haggling with a merchant all the way to bargaining with Asmodeus himself.

**Strength (2/5)**: Being able to keep a creature restrained during a social encounter can certainly be useful, but it may not apply to all such encounters. Some DMs may allow a Strength (Intimidation) check during a social encounter, making the ability score a little more useful but it certainly isn't the prime stat for such encounters.

**Dexterity (2/5)**: Using stealth to sneak in on a conversation or using sleight of hand to hide items on your person away from the sight of a guard are both useful. Outside of these two, dexterity just isn't as useful for social encounters as it is for combat.

**Constitution (1/5)**: Social encounters rarely rely on an adventurer's hitpoints. The only possible application I could think of was constitution checks to outdrink a rowdy tavern-goer in order to gain information, but this really is an edge case. Con just isn't as useful here.

**Intelligence (3/5)**: Though not as useful as other mental stats, Intelligence can be very useful when preparing for a social encounter. Knowing who to talk to and what to say when you're there is a must have when dealing with a politically-involved campaign especially. Additionally, intelligence is great for creating disguises and forgeries for the party which will make gaining access to people and areas much easier.

Intelligence no longer affects the languages an adventurer knows like it did in previous editions, but identifying an unknown language with an intelligence check may certainly be useful to the party.

**Wisdom (4/5)**: Wisdom is used for an adventurer's insight and perception abilities, both of which are useful when dealing with social encounters. In addition to spotting others and trying to assess their behaviour, social encounters may also call for wisdom saving throws to avoid effects that will charm or otherwise alter the mind of an adventurer. The relevance of wisdom saving throws in social encounters makes the ability score slightly more useful compared to intelligence.

**Charisma (5/5)**: Charisma is THE social ability score. Persuasion, Deception, Performance, and Intimidation all rely on this ability score and each of these skills can be used to great effect in social encounters. Charisma is also useful for picking up news, rumours, and gossip which can provide new leads for the party to achieve their goals. Sometimes effects like a Zone of Truth will be present, again requiring a good charisma to resist the effect the spell creates, though this is uncommon.

***

#Exploration Encounters

Exploration encounters can take as little as a minute or as long as a year, depending on what is required. They generally cover getting from A to B safely.

**Strength (3/5)**: Strength affects your carrying capacity, allowing you to carry more equipment (and treasure) while exploring. Additionally, athletics can be used for climbing, swimming, and other physical activities when barriers are presented during exploration encounters.

**Dexterity (3/5)**: Dexterity can be used to travel stealthily, should that be required. Additionally, skills like acrobatics can be used to get across unstable rocks, balance over vines or to navigate safely over thin ice. Dexterity is also useful for disabling/disarming traps that the party may come across while traveling.

**Constitution (2/5)**: Constitution is a must when traveling in extreme environments such as an arctic or a desert, but these may never come up for some parties. Exhaustion can be lethal so being able to resist it is certainly useful, though it can be remedied with adequate clothing, food, water, and shelter.

**Intelligence (3/5)**: Intelligence can be used to make knowledge checks that may assist in finding the correct path for the party. For example, a good history check may lead to knowing about a lesser known path, allowing safer travel through the lands lorded over by a red dragon. Additionally, Intelligence (Arcana) is useful for disabling magic based traps. Investigation may also be relevant for identifying hidden passages or illusions.

Though a rare occurrence, should your party ever find themselves on the astral plane, their intelligence will control how quickly they can move (equal to 3 x Intelligence feet). Suddenly the wizard is zipping around the battlefield, while the raging barbarian seems relatively sluggish.

**Wisdom (5/5)**: When out in the wild, Wisdom is king. It is used for the survival skill which can be used to navigate and search for food and water. Perception is also useful for spotting/hearing threats while on the road. If the party come across dangerous beasts, animal handling can be used to calm them down and potentially avoid a combat encounter. If your party doesn't have a competent navigator for your wilderness journeys, you're as good as dead.

Additionally, when traveling through magical terrain, wisdom saves are common for resisting certain effects such as nightmares.

**Charisma (1/5)**: Charisma sadly isn't as useful in exploration encounters. Looking through the books, it can be used to resist magical terrain effects much like wisdom can (see The Abyss, Arborea and The Beastlands optional rules in the DMG), but it certainly isn't as prevalent.

***

**Summary:** Overall, Dexterity is a very strong stat, but looking in the context of all 3 pillars of the game, it could be argued that Wisdom is more useful overall. That is simply an opinion, however.

I look forward to what everyone else thinks of the ability scores in 5e and what they are useful for. Criticisms and corrections are absolutely welcome, I am aware that I have biases towards usage of stats in certain encounters.

Lastly, I hope that this post may be useful to DMs that are concerned about certain stats taking too much of the spotlight in their games."

7,"I see no problem here, in a setting where gunpowder is freely available and the character is proficient with alchemist's tools, why shouldn't they be able to make their own gunpowder?

7,"I would say you could have handled this better.

For one, the character attempting to scavenge the exact ingredients of gunpowder without ever knowing what it is is a classic example of the player metagaming. They are using out of game knowledge to inform a characters decisions, and I think it is wrong for you to encourage this further by getting the player to research it so that the *character* would know. 

There are some instances where it is okay to just say no. If you don't want gunpowder in your world, you politely tell the player that it doesn't exist and move on. If they act maturely, they should understand and continue on with the game.

If you do want gunpowder in your world, by don't want it to be so easy, perhaps it is a very hard recipe to find or requires specific knowledge (perhaps a ritual, as if it were a magic item, this is a fantasy game after all). If that is the case, I recommend reading up on the Church of Gond and Smokepowder in the Forgotten Realms.

In my own game, I had it so that smokepowder was a closely guarded secret held in Gond's domain on the Plane of Mechanus. As a result, very few knew of its existence and even fewer knew how to obtain or make it. That changed when Duergar looted the secret from Mechanus with the help of a powerful Beholder, but that is another story."
7,"I understand why, but it is important to note that it is a rule that totally clashes with 5e's design philosophy.

There are very few features that confer penalties to checks, especially compared to older editions of the game. Arbitrary realism quickly bogs down the system, and is best avoided by using abstraction rather than such pointless rules."
7,You wanted to remind people of its usefulness by penalising PCs for wearing backpacks?
7,"This is just bad, honestly. It's pointless minutiae that only serves to hamper PCs and for no real reason. There are already encumbrance rules in the PHB, have you read over those?"

7,"To be fair, both definitions are equally correct based on context.

The Bag of Holding absolutely is not on a different plane, however, so it wouldn't be correct to say its contents are positioned outside of the plane the bag is on."
7,"Inside the plane that a Portable Hole leads into, sure.

The key is that the plane the portable hole leads to doesn't move, and moving the portable hole itself does not move the plane. That is not true for a bag of holding, however, its contents are stored in the bag itself and therefore move with it. 

I feel like the difference in rarity and the requirement of a flat surface and some actions justify this ability."
7,"Discuss this with your DM.

Going by the Monster Manual description, being a high level Wizard willing to commit abhorrent atrocities is a good start."
7,"A portable hole opens a door to a different plane, so you could put Spell glyphs in there just fine and access them inside.

However, if you were to then move the spell Glyph outside of that plane, it absolutely would be more than 10ft for the purpose of Glyph of Warding. Crawford has tweeted about the intention of distance and travelling between dimensions before."
7,"Extradimensional just means that it is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.

To be more specific, extradimensional space does not necessarily equal a pocket dimension. It certainly doesn't exist outside of the plane the Bag of Holding exists on either."
7,"A bag of holding is not a pocket dimension. Nowhere in its description does it state that. 

All it is, quite simply, is a bag that is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. Objects placed inside are still on the same plane."
7,"> I'm trying to figure out a way to be able to cast glyph of warding on an object and get around the 'can't move ten feet from where it was cast' restriction

You can't. 

Making a Glyph of Warding, putting it inside a bag and then moving that bag more than 10ft ends the Glyph of Warding."

If you're having issues with murderhobos, consider how much you care about your players' characters.

It might just be that your game isn't engaging your players as well as it could be."
7,"No worries, it's a common stumbling point for many. I know I struggled to get it when I was first introduced to it in the WH40K TTRPG system."
7,"You have a dice set that generates a number from 0 - 9,999. That is 100 times greater a range compared to a percentile dice set, which is 0 - 99"
7,"I know you have the right dice, who I was replying to was talking about something totally different.

15 in the percentile system would be a 10 on your percentile dice (d10 incrementing in 10s) and a 5 on the d10. One dice represents the units, and one the tens. 

Alternatively, you can use two standard d10s and have one colour for units and one for tens.

Like already mentioned by /u/SmoothieFakk, you want to roll 1 - 15, of which you have a 15% chance when considering a range of 100 numbers."
7,"You must be thinking of a different set of dice. A percentile dice goes from 00 to 99, with 00 representing 100 where relevant."
7,"I'd still consider just how much threat 20~ CR 1/4 monsters will add to an encounter. It isn't insignificant, especially at 7th level.

I would also consider just how comfortable you are with the party potentially obtaining the Wand too. If you don't like that thought, have it disintegrate upon the Warlock's death. Perhaps it was a cheap facsimile and the real, more powerful wand is elsewhere."
7,"I also forgot to mention time limits. If the party know they have 2 hours to stop a ritual, then they'll have to be more careful how and when they rest."
7,"Look at roaming monsters, every dungeon/hostile area should have them. Prebuilt modules will have some great examples.

In my dungeons, for each 10 minutes the party spends there, I roll a d20. On a 17 or higher, or varying depending on dungeon/area, I roll again on the roaming monster table. This table will be a collection of 6-10 preplanned encounters that wear the party down more. 

A short rest is one hour, and that is 6 d20 rolls. If you're making an encounter on a roll of 17 or higher, that's a 75% chance of at least one random encounter, forcing them to use more resources and making resting more dangerous."
7,"If you want to be more melee focused, more levels in Rogue for more sneak attack dice will help.

Alternatively, take spells that augment your melee ability. Shadow Blade is excellent, as it gives you a finesse weapon you can use to apply sneak attack damage. There are also spells like magic weapon or elemental weapon that can improve your weapon's damage."
7,"This is a classic example of a general rule vs. a specific rule. It isn't that they contradict, but rather are intended to work together.

The general rule is for spell scrolls. To copy a spell scroll into a book, the Wizard must succeed on an ability check. 

The specific rule is when wizard's copy spells into their book. Wizards can copy spells of 1st level or higher, if it is of a spell level they can prepare. Cantrips are below 1st level spells and wizards do not prepare Cantrips, so as a result there is no way that a Wizard can copy a cantrip into their spellbook."
7,"Firstly, if you don't want your players to become Werebears/Weretigers, don't make combat encounters with those.

Secondly, a character becoming a lycanthrope clearly isn't a threat in your game. You need to make it obvious that upon changing they are no longer in control and are a hazard to their own allies, especially in the case of Werewolves."
7,The monster manual details each dragon's typical personality very well.
7,"Of course a black dragon could make a lair underwater, it is an environment they do very well in. A sunken keep sounds just right for a black dragon too.

Breath weapons can be used underwater just fine. RAW, creatures gain resistance to fire damage while submerged in water, but acid damage is unaffected. 

You may rule that a dragon half submerged in water being attacked by creatures on land has cover. This is exactly what is done in the Forge of Fury and it is one of the best settings for a black dragon encounter that I know of."
7,"It's more art than science, honestly. Reading through published adventures, both official and 3rd party, will give you some ideas of how it can be done. I also recommend reading through Chapter 7 of the DMG which covers dungeon loot and treasure very well."
7,"Yes, so long as they are attacking with a finesse weapon. Reckless Attack is a very valid way of giving yourself advantage as a Rogue."
7,"I'm no expert on multiclassing or optimisation, but [this Giant in the Playground post](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?502248-Ultimate-Optimizer-s-Multiclassing-Guide) is ideal for players looking for advice on multiclassing in 5e. It goes into detail about all the combinations, so definitely check it out."
7,"5e is built with the assumption that a party faces 4-6 encounters between each long rest. You cannot adequately challenge the party with one deadly encounter, especially if that party is level 20.

Instead of having one encounter that features Tiamat, an ancient red dragon and 5 minions, space them out across other encounters. Have a trap room or some other hostile area to pass, requiring them to expend resources. Do that, and you'll now have more encounters and a more complete dungeon."
7,"> Can a character mount another character. 

Generally, no. A mount has to be one size larger and have an appropriate anatomy to serve as a mount. This has some DM fiat included, mind. See PHB 198 for more. 

> Advantage from being in a vehicle in combat? 

Unless the character has a feature that gives them benefits while being in a vehicle, no. Obviously, speed may be an advantage and some vehicles will offer cover to creatures inside them. Again, that depends on the vehicle. 

> Vehicle speed

Depends on the vehicle. Animal-powered vehicles will likely go at the speed of the animal, or perhaps half that speed if the animal is overencumbered. 

Some vehicles, like ships and airships, will have set speeds they can travel. DMG 119 can help with this. If you're looking for more specifics in regards to waterborne vehicles, definitely look up the Of Ships and Sea appendix of Ghosts of Saltmarsh. 

> Can a strong character pull a chariot? 

Of course. See PHB 176 to figure out how much a PC can drag."
7,"Inspiration should be used as an incentive for players to roleplay. This is especially true for newer players.

Makimg inspiration instead be earned by rolling a Nat 20 doesn't encourage players to roleplay, it just encourages them to roll more d20s somehow. Some classes, such as those with Extra Attack or bonus action attacks, will benefit from this house rule way more than others."
7,"In my opinion, there are better ways to make a game fun that adding lethal slapstick to comedy."
7,"Instantly missing is bad enough, I think that further punishing that quickly becomes arbitrary and silly. And at higher levels where characters are making more attacks, it doesn't make sense that a master swordsman is now more likely to chop his own finger off.

For that reason, natural 1s on attack rolls are nothing more than misses at my table."
7,"The main issue I see is the interaction of stowing/drawing weapons in regards to freeing hands. This weapon only serves to eliminate that drawback and with no penalty to balance it. Two weapon fighting relies on the wielder having two weapons, after all, letting them achieve the same with one, albeit two handed, weapon could be a little messy. 

I think you might enjoy looking dual weapon rules from previous editions. I think a dual scimitar may be somewhere in the Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron, so look there."
7,"Could you clarify whether you want this mechanical change to have one weapon to be used for two weapon fighting or not? It isn't exactly clear what your intentions are, for all I know it could be to abuse a mechanic you haven't mentioned."
7,"> Miniature could be used as a wizard, oracle, witch, Avian, Aarakokra, Kenku, or Tengu.

This is in the description of the product on the website. Obviously, not all of those feature in all editions of D&D, but it's pretty clear what the mini could represent."
7,"Older editions had rules for dual-weapons, but no counterpart yet exists in 5e.

As for a PC gaining the benefits of Two-Weapon fighting all while having a free hand, absolutely not."
7,"The flaw isn't with the damage of the natural weapons itself, but rather with how you are perceiving hitpoints as an abstraction.

Hitpoints are not meat points, they are an abstraction of a creature's luck, will to fight, mental state, energy, etc. This is explained on PHB 196.

As for tearing a human in half, that would be the case most of the time. Commoners (MM appendix B) have 4 hitpoints. A Tarrasque can easily deal enough damage to instantly kill them, likely ripping them in half or however the DM describes it. An adventurer with say 100 hitpoints is much more capable of fighting and as a result can avoid those killing blows more deftly, as a result of luck, physical exertion or some other detail abstracted into their hitpoints."
7,"The tweet linked in the other comment simply isn't relevant to your comment, sadly. Mearls' answer was that when a Wall of Fire is put down on a grid, it can either be orthogonal or diagonal. He never said that it can be a curve.

You'd really need to ask the designers this question yourself, honestly. As you have seen, this comment chain has been an inconclusive mess.

Edit: As for the line debate, the reason that line doesn't appear in Wall of Fire is because it has different dimensions. Lines have a length and a width, with no other parameter. As a result, they are always cylindrical in 3D space. Wall of Fire describes a 60x20x1 ft wall, it would not be helpful to use the description of lines here as it is specific to a different shape of spell effect. I really should have mentioned that point earlier, but oh well."
7,"It definitely added another level of challenge for the party, but nothing beyond their ability. The mixture of rage and burrowing through the ice did prove to be a potent combination, however, as they downside of reckless attacking was often offset by the dragon being readily able to retreat and only worrying about attacks of opportunity. It was a lot more interesting to have a dragon that was more focused on close combat, rather than flight and their breath weapon."
7,"I have had a dragon with Barbarian levels once. That was a lot of fun, especially for playing up the bestial aggression that white dragons have.

Making a dragon with Paladin/Cleric levels that is dedicated to Tiamat or Bahamut is also really interesting too. A Dragon with a paladin's auras makes them and their minions all the more threatening and will definitely throw a new challenge at your players."
7,"There's nothing implying the wall can be a curve. There is a fair deal implying that it is either a straight wall or a ringed wall (i.e., the spell literally describing those shapes).

If a wall is described as being 60ft long, 20ft high, and 1ft thick, it is most sensible to assume that it is straight. Allowing these measurements to be flexible leads to some odd situations, such as having a wall that arcs around its length or its height. Does it make sense for a wall of fire to instead be a tunnel of fire? I would argue not. 

Like I said, if the spell was intended to create curves, it would either explicitly say so, or it would be really easy to get a designer to clarify. Older editions, which are generally more verbose and descriptive, also describe the wall as being like a curtain or line, and much more clearly imply that it is straight. If 5e intended to change this behaviour, wouldn't it make more sense to be explicit about it?"
7,"That argument can similarly be applied to it not being a curve, honestly. I think it is fairly well implied that the dimensions of the wall create a 60ft long wall, not a 30ft wall that turns left and extends for a further 30ft, or whatever other variation can be made up to be.

Like I said earlier, I would love to see any sources stating otherwise, but there no relevant sage advices or tweets that support a curved wall of fire."
7,"Picking levels as you go is fine, though I would be wary of spellcasting modifier if you want to focus in on that. Fortunately, 5e is a lot more forgiving in terms of multiclassing and character building. It's considerably harder to make an ineffective character in 5e compared to older editions, especially if you're only split between two classes."
7,"For generic fighter types, I use the guard statblock and change weapons/armour/equipment as necessary. I find it works well as a squire statblock, all things considered.

You may also want to bump up the guard's charisma to reflect their Paladin status, and perhaps even give some of them Paladin spellcasting."
7,"No Urban environment by RAW in the PHB, you're right. That said, it's always wise to work through these things with your DM. I think it's fine, but I can see why it isn't in the PHB by default. 

It's a hard justification to say that Urban is a ""natural"" environment :)"
7,"While I agree that walls can be any shape, I think it is fairly well implied that the Wall of Fire fits within the neat shape provided by its dimensions, not some squiggly deformation of that.

If the Wall was intended to be a curve, then why does the spell have to specify that it can also be a ringed wall of a 20ft diameter? Surely with your interpretation the wall could just be curved into a circle of approximately 20ft diameter?"
7,"Nor does it say that it creates a curve of some description. I think the intention is pretty clear that it is straight, except from when it forms a ring, but it would be nice if some other source indicated otherwise."
7,My point is that I don't think it's valid to quote Mearls when he wasn't supporting the idea that a Wall of Fire can be a curve.
7,"If you look in the spell AoE section in the PHB, lines are straight. Mearls was stating that, on a grid, lines do not have to be orthogonal, they can also be diagonal."
7,"For spell effects, a line is always straight from its source.

The Sage Advice referenced in the other comment is still accurate, Mearls was stating that lines can be diagonal on a grid instead of strictly orthogonal. 

RAW, if a spell effect says ""line"", that is a straight, mathematical line. It is not a curve, or a series of connected lines (zig zag)."
7,"I'm not too familiar with the combination to give a proper insight, but you might get a lot of great insight if you post this question over on /r/3d6.

Obviously, a Ranger/Sorcerer multiclass is a little MAD, but if it is just a dip in either class then fully into the other class, having a lower spellcasting score for the dip class should be fine."
7,"They can't suffer from exhaustion by forgoing long rests, but they still need to take a long rest with food and water in order to recover from exhaustion."
7,"What you're describing actually sounds quite similar to what is mentioned in the character description/background advice in the Monk section of XGtE. It has a table with various animal styles, similar to real world kung-fu. You could always have one Open Hand Monk fight with tiger-style and another with mantis-style, even though they follow the same tradition.

If you are instead looking for a subclass of monk that has options at various subclass features, perhaps using Way of the Four Elements as a guide may help."
7,"There's a miscommunication here.

OP isn't planning making a PC and using it as a monster statblock. This is generally a bad idea, something we agree on. 

Instead, they are taking an existing statblock (MToF Deathlock) and adding class levels to it. 

It's a perfectly valid way to create monsters and is explicitly recommended in the DMG. Of course, the product of adding class levels to a statblock can be tweaked further, which I am sure OP will do."
7,"Contrary to the other comment, giving monsters class levels is a great idea! It is outlined clearly in the DMG and is a great way to quickly make new monster types from existing templates.

However, I would be wary of giving such a relatively low CR monster such a powerful artefact. It absolutely will raise its CR, but will make for a very swingy encounter. 

Additionally, do you really want a level 7 PC welding the Wand of Orcus?"
7,"As I understand it, a soul that passes into an Outer Plane after adopts a physical form, but this seems largely dependant on the outer plane. In the case of good/neutral aligned planes, this generally seems to be a form similar to their original body (heroes manifesting in Ysgard seems like the best example here). 

However, for an evil-aligned plane the results seem to vary. The Nine Hells treats souls in a very ""industrial"" sense for example. A soul might be confined to the Styx, may manifest as a Lemure or may even be turned into a soul coin and used as currency or as fuel."
7,"There are some planes that make specific reference to humanoids existing on them, at least in the 5e DMG.

For example, Arcadia specifically references Dwarves that exist on the plane and are special as they instead have the Celestial type. I imagine Bytopia is similar, but with Gnomes instead. Acheron would be chock full of Orcs and Goblinoids. Ysgard would be filled with fallen, humanoid heroes.

From all those explicit examples, it seems like it would be more strange to *not* see humanoids in the outer planes."
7,"Except that's not how the Half-Orc feature works at all.

Savage Attack lets you roll **one** of the weapon's damage dice on a crit and add it to the total. Assuming you're using a shortsword and get sneak attack, that's 1d6 + 10d6 on a successful attack, or 3d6 + 20d6 on a critical hit. How did you get 60d6?"
7,"If Person C wants to end Person B's grapple on Person A, all they have to do is move either Person B or Person A outside of the grapple range of B. 

The best way for Person C to end this grapple is to make a shove against either B or A. Alternatively, C can grapple B and just move them, as this doesn't also forcibly move A and therefore frees A from B's grapple."
7,"The Brute subclass was released as a Fighter archetype in an Unearthed Arcana document quite a while ago. 

I can't remember where and who by, but I did read something along the lines of ""if a UA feature isn't updated or officially published after a year, assume it has been dropped"". To my knowledge, the Brute subclass wasn't nearly as favourable as the archetypes that made it into XGtE and only the Circle of Spores from that UA has been progressed (see: Ravnica). The School of Invention may make its way into Eberron, though it does seem to me that its best ideas have been absorbed into Artificer."
7,"Not really, the party found it much more interesting than that as a result of the weapon's sentience. The party's monk actually ended up taking 4 levels in Ranger, initially just because they wanted to unlock the weapon's secrets."
7,"Because the bow was made specifically for a Djinni's tracker, and as a result was only suitable for a Ranger."
7,"I'm the DM for my group, the players just decide amongst themselves who each item should belong. Generally that means the item goes to who will benefit most from it, but the PCs often swap items around between themselves. 

When awarding magic items, I don't consider the makeup of the party at all. Instead, magic items are decided based on the nature of the dungeon and how likely the item is to be there. For an example, I had a Blue Dragon that lived on the Plane of Air prior to returning to the Prime Material. Amongst her possessions was a sentient shortbow that housed an air elemental. The item could only be attuned to by a ranger, but I didn't change that fact because the party had no ranger."
7,"Class features still work while wildshaped, so if you want to be a literal Kung-fu panda, then Monk and Circle of the Moon Druid is a great combo."
7,"I had a Rare ""Potion of Magic Replenishment"" and a Very Rare ""Potion of Greater Magic Replenishment"".

Both potions functioned similarly and had the same writing as the Pearl of Power (allowing higher level slots to be replenished by lower level slots). 

The first replenished a spell slot of 1d4 level or lower, the second replenished a slot of 1d6+1 or lower. They couldn't add an extra spell slot, only replenish an expended one, so rolling a 4 when the caster only had a 1st level slot expended would restore that 1st level slot."
7,"It's an outlandish request, that's for sure.

If you're playing in Adventurer's League, absolutely not. No such player race exists. 

If you're playing outwith AL, then ask your DM."
7,"The naval weapons may be accurate in AC 4, I don't know. Most of my naval warfare knowledge comes from the British fleet under Nelson, and from that I am certain that mortars were feature primarily in the sieging of ports rather than against ships.

With a mortar, it helps to be relatively still, which isn't a real hindrance while sieging a port. However, in a naval battle, movement and mobility is key (and if you read up on the many victories of Nelson and Sydney-Smith, that's a key factor in their approach). 

Additionally, cannons on ships are arranged by deck. It is very hard to fire a mortar on a ship from anywhere but the top deck, which isn't space efficient and is horrendously vulnerable."
7,"I'd avoid having range affect damage, no other ranged weapon does that and it doesn't even make sense for the mortar.

Unless a different shell is being launched and as a result has a lesser range, if that's what you mean?"
7,"To my knowledge, ship-mounted mortars were primarily for attacking land targets rather than other ships, especially coastal fortifications or amassing troops. There might be some utility to fire a mortar into a more densely packed formation of ships, but if you look at warships specifically designed to attack other ships, you'll find that it was an assortment of more regular cannons in their compliment and not mortars."
7,"I would combine the entry for both the Cannon and the Trebuchet in the DMG's siege weapons to make something that is suitable.

I'd use the same damage/attack modifier as a regular cannon, but I'd change the range to be 800/3,200ft, while being unable to attack targets within 60ft. You could also modify it further with explosive shells that force a Dex save and deal piercing damage instead. 

If you want to go a little further with it, I'd perhaps also use the scatter dice for artillery as featured in WH40K. Not related to D&D exactly, I know, but I have used these dice to great effect for mortars in my own game."
7,"There is no official Discord for the subreddit (as mentioned in the FAQ), but there are plenty of communities in other places. Search around and hopefully you'll find something you like."

7,"Yes.

Unlike the Two-Weapon Fighting rules, no feature says they do not add the modifier."

Carpenter's Tools seems generally more for furniture or other areas of joinery and Woodcarver's Tools applies more for whittling wood instruments, bows, staves, etc. Crossbow quarrels could certainly be a Woodcarver's, Smith's or Tinkerer's tools in my eyes, especially with the lack of Fletcher's/Bowyer's tools."

7,"If you treat the lore surrounding ancient figures as mythology rather than accurate, factual history, it all makes a little more sense. I treat the published lore as certain viewpoints that certain people hold rather than concrete history, and that approach makes the apparent contradictions make way more sense. 

The general point is that Gith's exact story isn't entirely well documented, all that is certain is that she went to the Nine Hells and secured an agreement with Tiamat that led to the Githyanki gaining access to loyal red dragons. 

Either story of her fate after could be true, depending on who you ask. Like many stories in our own world, the truth is often impossible to discern and there are often variants and disagreements, especially with anything remotely mythological.

Edit: The above is largely rambling, it turns out that the Monster Manual was changed in a 2018 errata (after my MM was printed) to read ""Vlaakith returned"" rather than ""Gith returned"". This makes more sense as that whole paragraph implies that Gith never went to the Nine Hells but rather sent Vlaakith as an ambassador of sorts, which once again contradicts MToF which makes it clear that Gith visited the Nine Hells and not Vlaakith."

You can also find ways to impose disadvantage on the Rogue's ranged attacks, and make it harder for them to reliably get sneak attack on every turn they have."
7,"And not to forget the legendary adventure ""Expedition to the Barrier Peaks"". An adventure set in a crashed spaceship that features androids, power armour, laser weapons and alien creatures, and yet it works just fine within the D&D system."
7,"I ran a game in a homebrew setting that functioned as a fusion of Final Fantasy 7 and STALKER. I don't know what term is best to describe it, but it had a magepunk aesthetic in a style similar to Eberron. There are the firearm rules in the DMG and the renaissance firearms can be slot right in with existing equipment and don't shake up the game too much, honestly. 

In my setting, the bullets were made of charges that propelled shot with concentrated weave energy, but gunpowder works just fine too."
7,"There are a few options as many cultures have some sort of ""glorious battlefield"" afterlife.

The most Norse of them all is the Outer Plane of Ysgard that is home to slain heroes that wage constant battle against giants and dragons on the plane. Any culture following the Norse pantheon or a deity like Tempus is likely to desire their soul making its way to Ysgard. 

In a similar vein, the Orcs and Goblinoids have their deities waging an endless war on the plane of Acheron. Hobgoblin especially may be likely to see Acheron as a reward for their mortal service in war."
7,"A Wisdom (Medicine) check is useful for stabilising a downed PC, but that's just one of its uses.

In my games, I have asked for Wisdom (Medicine) checks for when a PC was trying to identify whether or not certain villagers were afflicted by a disease. I have also asked for an Intelligence (Medicine) check for a PC trying to recall knowledge on how to cure a specific affliction."
7,You could give the Shadar-Kai in MToF a little homebrew feature that lets them trap the souls of humanoids they kill. This fits in with the theme of the Shadar-Kai and the Raven Queen and gives you a small range of CRs to play with.
7,"I think the first issue is feeling the need to end a campaign at level 20. You can end a campaign at level 11 just fine, and if you want to keep that feeling of progression going you can start the second campaign at level 12.

In regards to avatars, these can surely be handled better as powerful NPCs assisting the party rather than the PCs becoming level 20 arbitrarily. Though a different theme, Storm King's Thunder has many points where the party may be accompanied by an allied giant who is considerably more powerful than any PC at that point. Perhaps you can use that as inspiration? Fair warning, powerful NPCs can sometimes overshadow the PCs, so be aware of that before using them."
7,"Creatures are forced to make a save on the start of every turn they can see the Medusa and are within 30ft. They are dangerous monsters, but I love to use them. Some players may find the difficulty of curing petrficiation frustrating, however, especially at early levels where it is basically a death sentence."
7,"A jump from level 11 to 20 sounds a little underwhelming to me personally. That's 9 levels of adventuring (potentially a year or more in my experience) that is just being glossed over all just to make an ""epic finale"". It might be awesome, but it isn't earned and that is the part that worries me most. 

Why not approach the situation differently and have a dungeon/final boss that is challenging for a party of level 11 and still as epic?"
7,"I don't own the book myself, so I can't give too much insight honestly. That said, if you're a fan of the Sword Coast or just want to make a campaign setting that takes elements from the Sword Coast it might be worth your time and money."
7,There is also the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide which contains some more player options (some of which are republished in XGtE).
7,"Read PHB 194-195, specifically the section on Unseen Attackers and Targets.

If you can't see your target, you have have disadvantage on the attack roll. If your target can't see you, you have advantage on the attack roll. The section also handles guessing where a target is, but unless the creature has taken the Hide action while heavily obscured, a PC may still know their location in a Fog Cloud even when they can't see them.

****

To address your specific situations:

- A creature averting their gaze ""can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn"", so refer to Unseen Targets. The attacker has disadvantage on attack rolls and can't target the medusa with spells that rely on sight. 

- The Gnoll attempting to attack a Monk within a Fog Cloud would be an Unseen Attacker attacking an Unseen Target. The disadvantage/advantage cancel out and the Gnoll makes their attack roll normally."
7,"Without sounding too broad, you have to make something that the players are interested in and want to engage with. That means tailoring your content to entertain the players, rather than just hoping that what you have made will resonate with the group.

In your next session, try including something to specifically interest those players. It might give them their chance to be in the spotlight for that session and might encourage them to engage with your game."
7,"The back of Xanathar's Guide has a few pages listing names taken from various real world cultures that you can use for your own character.

Alternatively, stealing names (or parts of names) from existing media is great too."
7,"Build the campaign in the direction that the players want. If your party really enjoys dealing with complex traps, give them a dungeon with plenty of them. If they enjoy hunting dragons, give them some dragons to hunt. By including more of what the players enjoy, your players will continue to enjoy the game more.

For the world itself, I recommend letting your players have some direct agency over the world. If a player mentions a location, NPC or faction in their backstory, let the player flesh that part of the world out. It will make your world more varied and richer for it."
7,"Playing such an abnormal character will require working with your DM, so ask them instead of a reddit community.

To my knowledge, there is no official animated armour character race, but you could look for a home brew creation. Alternatively, check out Eberron's Warforged as that will fit your needs too."
7,"Damn, I am glad it worked! I hope all your future sessions go as smoothly!"
7,"As a DM, there are three things that I love my players to do.

The first is just to ask questions about the environment. Whether that is asking about some quality of a dungeon, some quality of an NPC or something about a rumour they heard. It often means an ability check, but it allows me to give the players information without any unsolicited lore dumps. It also makes me think the players care, which is nice.

The second is when the players actively tie their characters into the world. Whether this is just having them be from a specific region I told them about or having their character backstory be tied to the plot, it allows me to do a lot more with the sessions.

The third is when the players go off role-playing between themselves in a session. When this happens, I don't have to do anything and I can spend the time prepping the next encounter or I can just stand back and enjoy the moment."
7,"Use what inspires you.

Take a horror movie, show, story, painting, whatever and steal directly from it to make your own adventure."
7,"Look up Matt Colville's ""Delian Tomb"". It's a very simple dungeon perfect for 1st level. Scaling is easy to as its just a case of adjusting the number of goblins present."
7,"> Why not?

Because I don't want a level 1 spellcaster to be able to charge it up as much as a level 17 spellcaster. 

As for the other tweak, please reread it in full. I would be changing the item to be a ring augmenting other melee weapon attacks, rather than making the item a weapon itself. The base 1d8 force damage is similar to a Paladin Divine smite (again, as I mentioned), where a level 1 spell slot deals 2d8 force damage, 2nd does 3d8, 3rd does 4d8, etc."
7,"Rolling for stats won't break modules, though DMs should be aware that a party that universally rolls well might have a slightly easier time with the module. If that's the case, it is easy enough to compensate by adjusting the difficulty of some encounters. This is also true for parties that roll poorly for ability scores."
7,"I like both of these and will likely use them in my own campaign at some point.

I think the Magician's Knuckles can be better balanced by only storing a single spell slot rather than levels of spell slots (ie, no stacking 9 level 1 slots to make a 9th level slot). I'd also change the damage to be 1d8 + Xd8s with X being the spell slot stored in the device. That is just personal taste as keeping it in line with the Paladin Smite and Eldritch Smite is more intuitive. Additionally, rather than treating them as a discreet magic weapon, I'd let them be channeled into any melee weapon attack. That allows the item to exist as a ring, rather than a weapon and proficiency does not become an issue."
7,"Cast Zone of Truth

Hope they fail the save (they will have advantage, IIRC) 

Ask them ""Are you a snake person?"""
7,"I'm of the opinion that slavery has been done often enough in fantasy, and for many today it isn't a particularly relevant issue.

I find issues like contrasting cultures or religions much more interesting, especially given many of our own world's current conflicts. Class conflict is also an interesting one as it has many historical stories to pull from and is incredibly relevant in today's world."
7,"I wouldn't have the Zombie Beholder be there at the start of the encounter with the necromancer and some other minions, that is definitely stacked against the party.

However, a Zombie Beholder would be a great minion elsewhere in the dungeon. You could even have it so that the necromancer will desperately call on their enthralled zombie Beholder if the party attack them, further encouraging the party to think tactically and avoid such a situation."
7,Become a Wizard of the School of Abjuration and have fun with Counterspell and Dispel Magic.
7,"Some people don't know that the subreddit exists. You can always help out in the community by linking to the subreddit when you see such questions, if you'd like. :)"
7,"If you're in the UK, make sure to find out when the Fresher's/Society Fayre is. Most universities have them or something similar and your university may have a tabletop or role-playing society."
7,"Adventures often reference things in the DMG like madness rules and non-SRD magic items, that's the only reason I pointed it out."
7,Probably because a d10 is the only standard D&D dice shape that is not a platonic solid. That lack of symmetry compared to the other dice does make it stand out.
7,"A Potion of Stoneskin I would put at Rare if it functions like a Scroll of Stoneskin without the spell list restriction, but I would put it at Very Rare if it functioned like some other similar potions and didn't require the drinker's concentration (see things like Potion of Invisibility or Potion of Flying).

Petrification is a very powerful condition, so a poison that can apply the condition immediately I would consider Very Rare or perhaps Legendary. If it functioned more like the spell Flesh to Stone, Very Rare is still reasonable. If it is a temporary Petrification, perhaps Rare is suitable.

Edit: corrected a term"
7,"None.

Tieflings cast Hellish Rebuke as a racial trait without the need for spell slots. Barbarians do not get spell slots from their progression."
7,"My bad, I should have realised that before using so many acronyms. Here is a cheat sheet:

DMG = Dungeon Master's Guide

MM = Monster Manual

PHB = Player's Handbook

WotC = Wizards of the Coast"
7,"The core rulebooks are a must for most premade adventures. Descent into Avernus will most likely reference existing material in the DMG and MM without giving you copies of them. It may not reference as much of the PHB, but you will likely want a copy of that too anyway.

Dice are great, but rolling apps exist too if that is required. Character sheets can be printed from WotC's site with their freely available pdfs. 

There is the Starter Set and the upcoming Essentials Kit, but neither will give you everything you need to run a premade adventure."
7,"I know it isn't the most technological solution, but I find it very convenient to delegate music playing to one of the players. I group playlists on Spotify and simply request a certain playlist that they can set to play for me.

If you have an Amazon Echo or another home assistant, you could also set playlists by voice command."
7,"Adding to the suggestion of Wight, I would also consider checking out the Zombie Beholder if you're looking for less intelligent undead."
7,"[Here is a link to the sub's getting started guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/wiki/getting started), I highly recommend that you check it out."
7,[Here is a link to the sub's starter guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/wiki/getting started). It is very informative and covers almost everything you need to know to get started.
7,"Placing a railroad adventure inside an open world does not stop that open world from existing. You really seem to be conflating a sandbox and open world here, that is the point I am trying to make that you are ignoring. These are different terms in game design."
7,"There are a few misconceptions here that I'd like to clear up to make it more obvious what I'm saying.

For starters, that is quite a restrictive definition of open world. Open world can still happen within a defined context, often a specific area of a map in regards to a ttRPG. In the case of Storm King's Thunder, the open world is the Northwest Sword Coast, and there is a reasonable degree of exploring around the area. The party could wander outside of that bounds, nothing would break, but of course that content isn't handled within the scope of the adventure. The fact that the adventure book is not infinite does not remove the fact that it is an open world.

What you are arguing is that prewritten adventures are railroads, and to an extent, I agree. There are certainly less built in sandbox options to prewritten adventures and that is likely because the writers have an intended path for the adventure to take. 

In summary, there are two spectrums. The first goes between absolute railroad and absolute sandbox. The second goes between open world and discreet levels, though this spectrum tends more to be separate modes rather than a continuum. Prewritten adventures (as written) tend to be railroads set inside open worlds, which is what I think you are describing albeit with some confused terminology. It seems that you are using ""sandbox"" and ""open world"" interchangeably when that isn't always the case."
7,You seem to be misunderstanding what open world means in the context of games. I think you're certainly in the minority when it comes to believing that published adventures don't support an open world game.
7,"Adventure books are not gospel, you don't have to abide by them at all. If you find a pre-written adventure restricting, change it. I'm pretty sure almost every adventure published has a similar disclaimer in its opening somewhere too, so I'm clearly not the only person who thinks that. 

In addition, ""open world"" in games is the opposite of ""level-based"". Looking at OP's other comments in a wider context, I think they are instead trying to figure out how to make their game more of a sandbox than a railroad. Sandbox isn't necessarily synonymous with open world, though they often come together."
7,"""Open World"" is sort of a default in D&D games. It only exists as a theme in video games due to the obvious limitations they have compared to tabletop RPGs.

Is there anything you're doing in your game that you feel is restricting this default open world element?"
7,All the feature says in regards to bonuses is a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon. It mentions nothing about applying this bonus to spells cast when using the weapon as a spellcasting focus.
7,Does the feature say it adds +1 to spell attack rolls?
7,"A ranged weapon that turns each attack into the equivalent of 1-4 dagger attacks will be quite powerful, perhaps even too powerful when considering things like Extra Attack with Crossbow Expert.

In terms of numbers, it's an average of 2.5x the damage of a dagger based on the average of 1d4. At the higher end when characters have 20 Dex, this weapon would deal on average 18.75 per attack. Compare this to the Heavy Crossbow's 10.5 average damage per attack and it is clear this weapon could outshine others."
7,"Yes, of course, but I couldn't even guess when.

It would be naive to assume that 5e will last forever, but I can see room for a 5.5e if the designers want to get as much out of 5th edition as they can."
7,"I really enjoy using Google Drive to manage my campaign setting. Using both Docs and Sheets linked together to represent areas, npcs and other things, I can easily navigate between the information I need.

For maps, I don't really have a singular physical region map as I am horribly unartistic. When I do make a make I intend to show to the players, I will draw it onto A4 paper and tatter it up a little. This makes for a nice prop for the players and it looks more like an object created in the world rather than a metaoverview of the region the party is in."
7,"If you're burnt out from the game, take a break. Let one of the players take over as DM. If none of them want to DM, meet up and play some other boardgames instead for a few weeks until you feel more motivated again.

If you come back and still feel unmotivated, consider a fresh start."
7,"Pact Magic spell slots can cast non-Warlock spells, Spellcasting spell slots can cast Warlock spell slots.

Multiclassing does not affect how your spell slots recharge, if Bard spell slots come back on a Long Rest, a level in Warlock doesn't change that.

As for replacing known spells, class descriptions state when that can be done. To my knowledge, that is always when you gain a level in that class, not another class."
7,"It sounds like your problem is more between the group and the DM, so talk about it like adults.

Antagonistic DMing is nothing new, but it could be an issue that your DM isn't aware of, so politely bring it up with them, ideally away from the table at first."
7,"I included my experience with tabletop gaming and DMing on my CV, it doesn't take up much space and touches on many of the relevant niches of the jobs I was applying for at the time. It only ever came up in one interview, mind, and only because an interviewer was interested (and also not the job I currently have).

The important thing is to make sure that you can identify how D&D/TTRPGs is relevant to the role you're applying for. This was easy enough for me as I was primarily applying to graphics programming and game engineer roles. There may be some relevant crossover for data analysis, especially if the role demands teamworking and verbal communication, so try and find that."
7,"No worries, I'm always happy to share my experiences with the XGtE magic item crafting rules."
7,"As presented in XGtE, recipes are just a suggestion anyway. You can use them for some magic items and not for others.

In my game, magic items of rare and above require the PC to track a recipe down (or experiment and make it, in some cases), while magic items of Uncommon and below do not require a receipt."
7,***frantic beeps and boops***
7,I always find rogue Modrons to be a great way to spice up any quest. Perhaps they find one wandering the grounds near Thundertree desperately trying to evade capture and find purpose.
7,"It really depends on what you want out of your character. Do you want some neat warlock abilities? Do you want more versatility out of combat with Rogue features?

If you're looking for optimisation advice, /r/3d6 is great for that."
7,"The adventure certainly opens up a lot more once the party reaches Phandalin. That does come with the new issue that the party will have to be more proactive in order for things to happen. That means visiting places in town, talking to NPCs and most importantly reminding themselves why they are there.

That said, if the party are unengaged and aren't sure what to do, you can be proactive and have action come to them. Just like the goblins ambushing them at the start, have an NPC approach then and ask if they saw Gundren on the road, or ask why they look so disheveled and accuse them of being redbrands."
7,"It's pretty simple for me, I just like seeing the reactions of my players. Smiles, looks of shock and awe, and laughs, they all make the game worthwhile for me."
7,"For a White Dragon, I used ""Ryllvanguur"" which I think is a portmanteau of ""Terror Wing"" translated from Icelandic.

For a Black Dragon, I used ""Unagskaal"" which is a deformation of Night Skull, the same dragon that I lifted the encounter from in another module (Forge of Fury, maybe). 

Though not 3 syllables, the Red Dragon currently terrorising my party is Hariqtherax, which is a little closer to traditional D&D dragon names."
7,"Players really shouldn't be relying on the features of their character to determine what is fun, to be honest. 

Without sounding too harsh, if they found it slow and boring it was likely more down to your DMing style rather than the level you're playing at. If you're new, that is to be expected, you will learn how to make a more engaging game as you gain more experience as a DM. Playing at higher levels doesn't magically fix this.

In regards to LMoP not having ""story or gameplay value"", you will need to explain what you mean by this. LMoP has plenty of story in it with a good handful of NPCs and quests. However, it is the DMs job to make that come to life. Again, this is something that will be developed through practice and experience."
7,"Check out the Treasure Hoards in Chapter 7 of the DMG. You can appropriately stock a lair based on the CR of the monster inside it.

As for what loot works best, each dragon has different tastes. Read through their entry in the monster manual and use that to inform your decision."
7,"Focus on Fighter, but perhaps also consider Bladesinger as an option for extra melee power"
7,"I really like the Monk archetype. I don't think it's too overpowered, though I am interested to see how its level 17 feature plays out as it seems very powerful with the 6 attacks.

The Barbarian seems open to some exploits with the Spell slot recharge feature. That said, I think an easy fix is to limit its use based on con modifier."
7,"It's completely down to personal taste. Your choice of instrument proficiency does not impact how your character functions mechanically, but it may influence how they are roleplayed."
7,Do you want your Gish to be more sword-swingy or more spellcasty? That answer should drive the character you make.
7,"I recommend they check out the Rogue Assassin. It's the perfect subclass for playing a hitman style character, right down to the disguises and poisons the character uses."
7,"Weird seems to imply that the source of the fear is the origin of the spell itself as it seems that the illusory fear persists while the spell is active.

That said, I can easily see how some might interpret the source to be the caster themselves. There seems to be a little wiggle room in how the spell is written, perhaps deliberately."
7,"It happens to all of us, so I wouldn't feel bad about it. Even Matt Mercer has been open about his experiences of perceived lackluster DMing.

My advice is to focus on what went well and consider what went wrong to learn from it. Maybe it was just an unexplained experience and a one off. Perhaps it was something that can be learned from. In my opinion, it's most likely the former and nothing to beat yourself up about. Future sessions will go differently, and hopefully for the better."
7,"Assuming 5e

You could read over the basic rules if you want some sort of overview into how the game's mechanics work. They're freely available on WotC's site. 

That said, if you're all new I wouldn't worry too much about it. You'll all be learning the game at the same pace most likely, so I'd just be open to sitting down and trying to make sense of the system as a group."
7,"I have a similar feeling after quite a lot of my sessions. I have been DMing for two years and every now and then I'll kick myself over a missed opportunity or an encounter that fell flat. That said, every time it does happen it's important to step back and focus instead on what went well. Perhaps an encounter went better than expected or maybe the players just had a lot of fun. 

The mistakes can be used to improve future sessions, sure, but dwelling on them will only make you worry unnecessarily, especially when your main worry as DM should be ""Did the players have a good time?"""
7,"Definitely feel free to make your own characters for LMoP, both groups I played in did so. Again, the basic rules can help with this.

The premades have some built-in ties to the adventure's story, but you can just as easily do that with your own characters."
7,"I highly recommend the 5e starter set for any new DM. I have ran it as both a player and a DM and the adventure is great at introducing newcomers to the game and its rules. It's also fairly inexpensive, I recently purchased it as a gift for my younger brother at about £18.

For other starting off points, you can always get the 5e Basic Rules for free from WotC's site which will let you start a game easily using a leaner and more approachable rule set. You can even download apps to role your dice, but if you do want to buy your own a decent plastic set can be purchased fairly cheaply. Paper and pens can be used for maps/character sheets and bottle tops make cheap, reusable miniatures. Basically, you can get into the game for free, more or less."
7,"Surely you have some idea of who the group is before playing, so ask ahead and see what they expect newcomers to bring.

At my local gaming shop, newcomers are often lent dice and access to books to make sure they can play, but this will differ in other groups."
7,Calculate the CR for the level 11 fighter you made (in the DMG). That will give you your answer.
7,"Absolutely, not every feature of an NPC has to follow existing rules for PCs. If I have a powerful Druid and I want to make it obvious that he has absolute control over his environment, why not let him summon a storm once per day as a feature?"
7,"Here are two encounters from my recent ""Old Mage's Tower"" dungeon, hopefully they'll help you.

I really like using Spectators as guardians over certain locations. With the party size and level, you may wish to use two or bump up the CR. In my dungeon, the Spectator presented himself as ""The Doorman"" and was responsible for making sure that only college affiliates could pass the chamber he guarded. He was very talkative too, which made for an interesting social encounter. The party also realised that the spectator wasn't very perceptive and associated anyone with blue or grey robes as being college affiliates, and as a result he was easily tricked by the party's use of night gowns. 

The second encounter was a spawning stone of Mephits used to protect a corridor. Essentially, a fixed number of Mephits will be guarding a location with some sort of spawning stone in the room, and on initiative count 20 the spawning stone will aim to replace as many of the Mephits as possible. Taking 6 as an example, 6 Mephits guard the chamber, the party understandably initiate combat. Mephits are easy for them to take down and 4 die within the first round of combat. On initiative count 20, roll a 1d6 and that many Mephits reappear (so long as that wouldn't put the total mephit count over 6). The trick is for the party to disable the spawning stone, which can be handled a few ways. Perhaps the party just need to damage it, or maybe it's a skill challenge (similar to XGtE's complex traps). You might even rule that Dispel Magic disables the stone, which is fair as it still requires the party to expend a resource."
7,"A dough hook could be used as a sickle, I suppose.

There are always an array of knives to choose from for cutting bread, butter and pastry too, so daggers are certainly an option."
7,"That's a very good question, actually.

I guess it makes more sense if you think of snakes ""standing"" as them coiled with their head raised and ready to strike. From that pose, it seems perfectly conceivable that they could then be knocked prone, even if they lack legs."
7,"That just seems like a justification for adjusting the respective hit points of each creature, rather than their weakness to fire."
7,"If you're looking for a point of reference, Ice Mephits are vulnerable to both fire and bludgeoning damage. This makes intuitive sense as they are made of ice.

That said, golems are also generally magical in construction and likely have some compensation for fire damage in their design.

If it were my design, I'd at least give them some form of weakness against fire damage, whether that is something like vulnerability or perhaps a feature that is shut off for a turn when fire damage is taken. This at least makes sense to me, if I didn't want the golem to be weak to fire they'd be make of something else (like stone)."
7,"Yes, nothing about the Font of Magic feature puts a limit on what spell slots can and can't be turned into sorcery points. There is a limit in the other direction where only spell slots up to 5th level can be created from sorcery points. Keep in mind that you can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level."
7,"Yes, as nothing about the Arcane Ward feature specifies that the spell cast has to consume a spell slot nor does it exclude ritual spells. Casting Abjuration spells as a ritual or with the Spell Mastery feature, you can create or recharge the ward."
7,"Read the multiclassing rules for spellcasting on PHB 164, everything is explained there.

You cannot cast a 3rd-level spell using a 1st-level spell slot, spell slots can only be used to cast spells of levels that are equal to or less than the spell slot's level."
7,"You don't need a Rogue or Bard to have characters capable of doing well on Investigation checks. As it is an ability check, you can always have a Cleric or Druid cast Guidance or Enhance Ability.

Additionally, parties aren't meant to be strong against every possible thing the DM could throw at you. Your party is weaker at investigating traps/secrets, but so what, you'll do fine without it. If you're really concerned, take the skilled feat and gain proficiency in Investigation or use Ability Score Increase to boost your Intelligence score."
7,"Magical items can still take damage like any other object, but they are generally resistant to damage (DMG 141). How many hitpoints an object has is up to the DM, but it is generally defined by the item's size and sturdiness (DMG 247).

Of course, if the bag is destroyed, all items inside are scattered into the Astral Plane."
7,"Read the rules, especially the ""Quick Build"" on PHB 52. Everything you need to know to begin with is in the book."
7,"If your concern is ""Is it breaching copyright to have a podcast featuring official material being played?"", the answer is no.

If you want to run an official adventure or run a game within an official setting and then make that a podcast, you're absolutely free to do so. It only becomes a breach of copyright if you do something like stream every page of the PHB, therefore distributing the material."
7,"As the attacks of Lycanthropes aren't magical by default, that does mean they are immune to the attacks of their peers.

That said, if a Lycanthrope needed to kill another Lycanthrope, why wouldn't they obtain access to magical weapons?"
7,"This isn't even a hot take, it's very clearly inspired by JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. That's quite neat, though, it's a very interesting monastic tradition."
7,"Rise of Tiamat includes information on how DMs can run the adventure for parties that haven't already played through Hoard of the Dragon Queen. Read through that section (it is quite brief) and use it to inform yourself as to whether or not you think the adventure fits. It is completely possible to run the adventure without it's prequel, though."
7,"> Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way

From that, it seems pretty implicit that appearance isn't altered (with the exception of the silver cord). 

That said, I can see some interesting things happening from Astral Projections providing a reflection of the creature's nature."
7,"Ask your DM, they know the answers to your questions."
7,"I deliberately didn't mention Warlock as they do not have Mage Armour on their spell list. Instead, they can cast it through the Armour of Shadows invocation."
7,"If you're looking to see whether or not a character would have knowledge about a specific monster, the DM should ask for an Intelligence check of some description rather than players reading the Monster Manual and applying that knowledge. A DM might ask for an Intelligence (Religion) check for a PC to recall information on Undead or Fiends, or they might ask for an Intelligence (Arcana) check to recall information on Constructs or Elementals, to give some examples. 

Interesting that you mention Rangers as their favour enemy feature gives them advantage on all Intelligence checks made about their favoured enemies."
7,"If you have been playing the game for any decent length of time, owning your own PHB is absolutely a good idea. For one, you get to directly support the creators of the game you're playing and secondly you don't have to leech off others at the table or resort to piracy.

I am interested, how do you play the game without a PHB?"
7,"My bad then, I perhaps came off as more cynical than was warranted.

Both campaign ideas are pretty distinct, with one being high magic and the other potentially being a lower magic setting, and a modern one at that. In my experience, 5e works much better for the former. For the latter, I'd consider a more suitable system for that type of game, Shadowrun springs to mind though I haven't played it myself."
7,"I completely understand where you're coming from, a character should not be defined by whatever quirky race the player could find. Many newer players seem to rely on that as a crutch for character design without first considering anything ""real"" about their character. In my experience, it's much more interesting to play something more grounded in the setting that is defined by their personal story, rather than their peculiar appearance. 

That said, if it takes the ability to be a cat-person or an elephant-man to get new players involved with the hobby, then I'm all for it. Most new players settle into making more substantive and interesting characters eventually, so let them play all the anthropormphic animals they want in the meantime, I say."
7,"Mage Armour lasts for 8 hours, which can cause some issues. If they're taking an hour to short rest too, then that's adding a whole other hour that not much is getting done, which could be important for some quests.

More importantly, spellcasters generally don't get spell slots back on a short rest. Of course, Wizards and Land Druids can use their Arcane Recovery/Natural Recovery to recover spell slots on a short rest (and can't do so until they finish a long rest), and using either feature for the sake of 1 level 1 spell slot seems wasteful."
7,"It sounds like the party have mostly been experiencing Uncommon magic items so far?

With them being level 8/9 and having just taken on a blue dragon (though ancient at that level sounds a little dubious), it seems like you should consider awarding the party with a Rare magic item. The DMG has plenty of suggestions and you can of course customise those further. If you want to, you could also create a homebrew magic item.

For any magic item, I recommend coming up with a story for how it got to where it is. In this case, how did it get to the dragon's lair? For significant magic items, this makes them even more special."
7,"If it sounds fun to both you and your players, then it's a good idea. 

I don't think you need the opinions of people who are never going to play in your game to decide what is best for your table."
7,"That's exactly what ability checks are for, to be honest.

If the player at any point goes ""What would my character no about X in regards to the Blood War?"" then it is the DM's job to either tell them what they would know, or request an Intelligence (Religion) check to see if they would know anything. 

For knowledge that requires a check, the DC can be fairly arbitrary, though there is a rough guide in either the PHB or DMG for setting any ability check DC. If they pass, they know, if they fail, they don't. You could also adjust the result based on the specific check outcome, which could make the result more interesting.

If it is ever important knowledge behind an ability check and they fail, at least tell them something along the lines of ""your character doesn't know, but they know that they can find the answer at X"". That approach stops blocks in the story and can lead to new adventure hooks."
7,"It depends on a variety of things.

Do you want to challenge your players with combat encounters? If so, considering having monsters come in waves. 

Do you want to have multiple combat encounters per long rest? In that case, don't let the party long rest every session and consider a long rest every 3rd session or so.

It could be possible that you just don't want a combat focused game, or to leave out threatening encounters in favour of more dramatic ones. There are a lot of variables, so do whatever you find fun."
7,"At the very least, some interest in RPGs generally is very useful when getting into D&D. That said, there are limits present in cRPGs which some new ttRPG players often forget are no longer in place, so my advice is don't let yourself get bogged down too much with the mechanical side of the game."
7,"I see what you mean, but ""Necromancy"" in the sense of Wizardry is clearly more malign in nature and is clearly what OP's question is about. The average citizen of Faerun doesn't care what spell school is being used to defile corpses, I'm sure all malign magic can be branded necromancy to some. 

While revivification/resurrection spells are in the school of necromancy, most healing spells are evocation spells."
7,"Extra Attack only applies when you take the Attack action on your turn.

Making one weapon attack as a bonus action is not the same as taking the Attack action."
7,"The Sword Coast villifies necromancy fairly unanimously, to be honest. You'd have to travel to places like Thay to find supporters of it, namely with the head Red Wizard Szass Tam being a lich and a prominent necromancer."
7,"A musical druid could work really well, honestly. You could take the Entertainer background and flavour yourself as a Druid using music to promote an advocacy for nature and peace. You could similarly be a Bard with the Folk Hero, Sage or Outlander background and achieve a similar goal too. As you can tell, 5e can be very open to diversity in character design, especially when it comes to backgrounds. 

I can't speak much of the Circle of Spores, however, I haven't read it since it was a UA document. To be honest, I can't speak much of Druids as they're one of the classes I haven't had a chance to play yet. I like the Circle of Dreams, but whether it fits a reggae character or not I don't know."
7,"Bard generally can be good with both, especially because of Magical Secrets. Like I said earlier, I think Glamour and Lore both fit well, but if you're looking for more spell variety for healing, then I recommend College of Lore.

Interestingly, there aren't any Bard Colleges (to my knowledge) that are explicitly tied to nature. For a Bard, that means expressing a connection to nature through your background."
7,"A lot of reggae seems to resolve around themes of piece and love, rarely is it violent. Perhaps those are view that your bard could embody?

The bright colours and charming nature of reggae could lend well to a College of Glamour bard. You could also focus in on the stories of a specific people (in the case of real-world reggae, this is often the Caribbean Islands and Rastafarianism), so perhaps College of Lore would fit well.

What I notice most about already published bard colleges is that they have nothing to do with specific music or aesthetics. Making a College of Reggae just doesn't make sense to me."
7,"One big problem I see about Rangers is that two of their primary core features are tied to non-combat encounters that might not always be relevant. I'm talking about Natural Explorer and Favoured Enemy. For players looking to play Rangers, it is their responsibility to ask the DM what environments and enemies will be most prevalent in order to get the use of these features. There's no point taking Desert as a favoured terrain if the adventure takes place in the Underdark.

In regards to their balance in combat encounters, I disagree that their terrible or underpowered (especially when considering the XGtE spells and archetypes). They have many interesting features that set them apart from Fighter and Paladin and out of combat they only become more interesting with how their features and spells complement non-combat encounters. That said, there are some types of campaigns that can just be boring to be a ranger in. Is that perhaps the case with your own game? 

Have you asked your players why they don't play ranger? Have they ever actually played a ranger? Is their opinion perhaps not one from experience and instead formed from the viewing of a biased YouTube video that seeks to jump on the ""haha, ranger bad, beastmaster sucks, only play revised ranger"" band wagon? In my experience, a lot of players get their opinion on certain D&D features without ever actually experiencing them, and it can be very toxic."
7,"It runs exactly like how you'd think, some of the party is in one place and the rest of the party are in another. This could be two rooms in a dungeon, two stores in a city or even two settlements in a region.

A good rule of thumb is to switch scene as required every five minutes or so in order to avoid one group being bored and left out. It can sometimes be confusing, but it isn't unmanageable. 

There is an exceptional extreme case where the party might be split for a full session, in which event it might be worthwhile to run two sessions, one for each subgroup, aiming to reunite them at then of the respective sessions."
7,"I played a strength-based Ranger recently and I got a lot of enjoyment from two-weapon fighting and using javelins or other thrown weapons when a ranged option was required. I still carried a longbow in the event it was ever needed, of course, even with a low 12 dexterity score.

Because I still had a positive dexterity modifier, I did get a benefit from medium armour, one that never justified taking the Heavily Armoured feat to me. However, your experience may be different if you want to lower the dexterity score further in favour of another ability score.

For archetype, I played Hunter but I was torn between that and Gloom Stalker. It entirely comes down to what that character is like, however, so take that in mind when creating them rather than exclusively ""what is optimal""."
7,"If you have ten that you're happy with, definitely stick with them. You can always focus on a smaller segment of those (say 3 or 4) to flesh out your campaign's starting area. As the campaign progress, you can continue worldbuilding as the game goes on and flesh out states as required."
7,"I have found no more than 7 to be an ideal number for unique kingdoms/factions within an area, especially when it comes to detailing their various conflicts.

Being ambitious with the world is fine, but it's all fruitless of the players never experience it or every detail is too lacking in substance because you spread yourself thin."
7,Why do you need 19? That seems like an unreasonable number that you'll struggle to create unique identities for and that the players will be very unlikely to interact with each one.
7,"That is not how saving throws work.

The only time a natural 20 affects the outcome of a saving throw is with death saves."
7,"You're not wrong, but it is also very low. If combat is still ongoing, it's very likely that the Wizard will just go down again anyway."
7,"Only Potions of Healing are listed in the PHB, you're right, but they're just one of many healing magic items presented in the DMG. 

Potions of Healing are common, but a consumable item that only heals between 4 and 10 hit points shouldn't be any rarer honestly. Compare that to other magic items such as Keoghtom's Ointment, the Staff of Healing and more powerful potions and it's pretty clear that an ability to heal doesn't decrease an item's rarity.

As for their ability to ""generally be purchased in low magic settings"", that seems to be a fairly baseless claim as widely available potions is not a mark of a low magic setting."
7,"Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. The dungeon is a crashed spaceship complete with alien creatures, androids and laser weapons. It's perfect science fantasy for D&D."
7,"I disagree, no Common items are nearly as powerful as the proposed item, and even the Hat of Wizardry in XGtE requires attunement and a successful ability check to cast Cantrips. In addition, a daily spell of a very useful adventuring spell has to be Uncommon, in my opinion. 

I have seen no indication that healing gets rated lower in rarity, where are you drawing that conclusion from?"
7,"The dragon will likely be burrowing under loose snow or ice so won't likely be leaving a navigable tunnel behind it.

Compare that to monsters like the Purple Worm which can explicitly burrow through solid rock and leaves a tunnel in its wake."
7,"Best thing to do is just compare them to magic items that already exist.

A magic item that allows a Cantrip to be cast as well as a single 1st-level spell per day sounds like an Uncommon magic item to me. It's roughly as powerful as the Circlet of Blasting overall, imo."
7,"I'd certainly read up on Conan the Barbarian and Swords and Sorcery settings, that seems to be what you're looking for.

In regards to heavy armour, I wouldn't go gung ho and remove them just to fit ""historic standards"". If you're having fantastical mythological monsters, why not do the same for armour? It seems very feasible to have bronze plate armour in such a setting, and by extension things like iron golems could instead be constructed of bronze."
7,"Circle of the Land. The extra cantrip, natural recovery and circle spells make for a very good spellcaster."
7,"The app certainly isn't handling multiclassing correctly.

If you look at PHB 164-165, you'll see that you should be a 2nd level multiclass spellcaster. Spells are known and prepared separately for each class, though."
7,"Assuming 5e

Its alluded to in the Monster Manual. What weapon/armour proficiencies monsters have is entirely up to the DM."
7,"Considering that the base number of items that a character can attune to is 3, having this require a minimum 18 Intelligence score seems crazy.

If you're looking to reward higher intelligence scores without penalising some players, perhaps consider tying the intelligence modifier to tool/language proficiencies. For example, a character with a +3 Int modifier could pick up two extra language proficiencies and a tool proficiency.

As already noted, utilise intelligence in encounters:

- Have combat encounters that require Intelligence saving throws. 

- Have exploration encounters that require Intelligence (Investigation) checks (especially for identifying the mechanisms in traps/secret doors, and Perception is NOT a replacement for Investigation). You could also have traps that require Intelligence (Arcana) checks to disable. 

- Have social encounters that require knowledge checks, such as Nature/Religion/Arcana."
7,"Have you read the description of Liches in the Monster Manual? They eat souls, pursue dark magic and fraternise with evil figures like Vecna and Orcus, that's pretty evil."
7,"As good as Moon Druid is, I'm not sure what makes them immune to being Counterspelled?"
7,"The DMG and MM already seem perfectly aware of this fact, however. If you look at the section that details the impact of resistances/immunities on a monster's effective HP and by extension CR, it is explicit that the modifier reduces as the monster's expected CR goes up."
7,"As handy as that poll is, I don't think it as at all indicative of most ""adventuring days"". For one, less than 3,000 people responded, it's not a high sample size.

Additionally, many seemed to conflate the concept of ""session"" and ""adventuring day"", the latter of which can be spread over multiple sessions. This is reflected in the replies to the tweet itself and Colville himself mentioning on a stream a while back that he should have specified he didn't mean ""combat encounters per session""."
7,"Obviously, memes and inexperienced DMs are not a good source for deciding what is and isn't balanced.

So long as you remember to adequately challenge a party, there's no reason that spellcasters should overshadow martial classes to the degree that some like to believe."
7,"It seems a little arbitrary, because many powerful spells often have costly components that already can't be replaced with a spellcasting focus.

That said, I'm unsure as to why you think there is such an imbalance between martial classes and spellcasters. From my experience, that only seems to be the case when parties are not challenged properly over and adventuring day and spellcasters are allowed to expend a lot of resources in each encounter."
7,"Wish is a 9th level spell, regardless of what spell it replicates. As a result, it is not eligible for use with Contingency.

That said, if you're playing a Wizard, you might prefer Clone as a backup for stopping your Wizard dying. Chances are, if your Wizard dies and Revivify brings them back to 1 hitpoint, you're not likely to survive for much longer if combat is still happening."
7,"8 is a nice level for tier 2 one shots. Players will often find that there's plenty room for versatility if they decide to multiclass but single class PCs also get to enjoy the second ASI.

If 8 is too much of a jump, level 5 is ideal as it introduces the features of tier 2 (extra attack, third level spells, upgraded Cantrips)."
7,"Hey Satine, what is your favourite monster to run in a D&D game? Whether that is for role-playing them or using their abilities in a combat encounter, I'd love to hear your answer."
7,"If you are concerned about DMing, buy the DMG and refer to it when you need to. A lot of the answers to many common DM questions."
7,"I'd refer to the DMG firearms rules. It recommends either going easy and treating martial weapons proficiency as also being proficient with firearms or requiring characters to train in a specific firearm to become proficient.

If this is for a homebrew game, you might want to decide for yourself which class grants which firearm proficiency."
7,"Hitpoints are an abstraction of both fitness and health, as I alluded to in another comment.

Rather than make my own remark as to how a PC would know how fit and healthy they are, I'll steal what was writing a few comments up:

> Not to mention the old trick of ""On a scale of 1 to 203, I feel like a 20""."
7,A PC would know how fit and healthy they are and could communicate that. A player can voice this in the abstraction of hitpoints.
7,"If the answer to the question ""Is this information that the PCs would know about themselves?"" a yes, then I don't see it as metagaming.

As a result, players telling each other how many hit points, spell slots, etc to each other is fine, so long as both characters are in a position to communicate such information effectively."
7,"DMG 133 = page 133 of the Dungeon Master's Guide

It describes how to award treasure and how much of it to award. It is well worth reading in full. 

You can also get a condense version of the chapter as part of the Basic Rules, which are available on WotC's site."
7,"This was a pleasure to read, I'm glad you and your players enjoyed the homebrew. It really does mean so much to read stories like these. 

Making a MK2 version would be straight forward enough, and if you're taking a techy route with it, perhaps consider a Recharge (5-6) Rocket Strike AoE attack?"
7,"I think one thing that high fantasy often does poorly is military engagements. As I see it, ready access to magic and the occasional flying mount (or even airship) would make combat seem more like modern warfare. Eberron does this excellently, especially with all the different flavours of fantasy army at play.

As a result, I imagine ""behind enemy lines"" operations could rely heavily on magic, especially illusion and enchantment spells. I imagine that sneaking into an enemy fortress with the assistance of invisibility and flight would be very interesting indeed."
7,"Assuming 5e

Seeming would work, but RAW it couldn't give a Guard Drake illusory wings."
7,"I recommend reading through Chapter 7 of the DMG, it explains all you need to know about magic items, how to award them, and how to make them special.

Alternatively, a condensed form of the treasure rules are available for free in the Basic Rules."
7,"Creatures are not objects, that is a pretty solid rule there. Individual body parts of creatures aren't objects either, unless it is severed and dead."
7,"That they do, thanks for pointing that out!"
7,"That sounds exactly how I imagine divine casters go about making magical weapons and armour, to be honest. Talk to your DM about magic item creation using downtime. 

There is also the spell Magic Weapon, but to my knowledge it isn't on the Cleric spell list. I know that Forge Domain Clerics get Magic Weapon as a domain spell and their Blessing of the Forge feature is also great for making magical weapons and armour, though RAW it does not apply to shields."
7,"The ""Your issue isn't a problem because my issue is worse"" approach is not a good way of helping anyone."
7,"Roll damage dice at the same time as the attack roll. It's a small change, but it really does save time.

Similarly, spellcasters should roll damage before knowing of their target(s) pass or fail their save."
7,"Yes, and studying history never once helped in such a situation.

Hence why I said that a general Intelligence check is normally best for recalling information."
7,"I interpreted the ""unless otherwise noted"" part as referring to the ""one Metamagic option"", of which Empowered Spell is an exception.

I can see how it could also be applied to when the spell effect happens, though."
7,"I'm not saying that you're wrong, but I'd really like to see a clarification from the designers. It's easy for DMs to rule either way and the language of the rules wouldn't need to be changed much to make it clear one way or the other."
7,"That is true, but the rules for Metamagic generally mention you can only use Metamagic when you cast a spell and mention nothing about while it's already in effect."
7,Metamagic is only applied when casting the spell. Damage dealt by Shadow Blade is dealt with subsequent attacks and not the Cast a Spell action itself.
7,"If it's your own history, why is an ability check being asked for?"
7,"I think many are confused by the question itself, it isn't entirely clear what OP is asking for."
7,"I gave my party a quest to recover wyvern eggs on behalf of the wyvern cavalry. Each egg was worth 750gp and that seemed balanced enough to me. For perspective, the party was leve 15 at the time."
7,"I'm quite okay with WotC limiting the half-races available in the PHB. Keeping the more popular half-orcs and half-elves while discarding the others allowed them to focus more on the core races.

Adding new half-races in as homebrew should be straight forward enough, however."
7,"Canonicity is very subjective as it varies from setting to setting, so I wouldn't let yourself be bogged down by it.

[Half-Dwarves at least exist within the Forgotten Realms](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Half-dwarf), and I can't see any harm in incorporating them to your own setting. Of course you'd need to find a homebrew or make your own, but I can't see that being too hard."
7,"Half-Orcs are interesting in that an Orc can breed with any humanoid and produce either an Orc or a Half-Orc as offspring (MM 245). I find it interesting that the PHB and XGtE imply that it is exclusively humans rather than other humanoid races.

To my knowledge, a Half-Elf is only produced between variations of humans, elves and half-elves.

Stretching beyond those bounds should create any problems, and I am certain that older editions had ""Half-Dwarves"". I cannot remember what they were called, however. I think some settings treat Halflings as Human/Dwarf offspring, however."
7,"Only Monks can make Unarmed Strikes with their bonus action due to their Martial Arts feat.

Unarmed Strikes do not qualify for Two-Weapon Fighting as they are not light melee weapons."
7,"Their magic still comes from their study and understanding of magic. Their magic doesn't come from their spellbook, it's just a place for them to store spells that they don't have committed to memory.

Adding spells to a spellbook represents an involved process of practicing the spell and inscribing it into the spellbook in such a way that the wizard can prepare that spell in future, or cast it as a ritual if possible."
7,"No, as Ghosts are not magical, but rather ""supernatural"" in the same way that Dragons are."
7,"That's one major positive that comes from rolling ability scores, every now and then you'll get a character with great average ability scores that makes these outlandish multiclass ideas feasible.

I'd say go for it, if it makes sense to you and sounds fun, no one can stop you! (except from maybe your DM, but they shouldn't!)"
7,"It will be easier, sure. More party members tends to do that.

Scaling up LMoP is easy enough, however, [and someone has done all the hard work for you here.](http://haluz.org/lmop/)"
7,"Give your combat encounters goals that are more diverse than ""eliminate the enemy"". This is true for both the goal of the party and their opponents.

Perhaps instead of ""kill the goblins"", it's a case of ""don't let those goblins flee and alert their allies!""

Instead of the bandits' goal being ""kill the party and loot their belongings"", it could be ""down one of the party members and attempt to run off with one of their magic items.""

For another encounter, it could move from ""kill the cultists"" to ""destroy the ritual circle so they can't summon a demon to make the encounter harder"".

Instead of a dragon waiting idly in its lair to be killed by the party, have the dragon preemptively attack the party then flee once it's at half HP. It's unlikely to kill the party, but they will likely expend resources and will be more vulnerable to the dragon's minions. Also remember that monsters have hit dice and can also benefit from resting.

You could also make the combat encounters more dynamic by incorporating elements of social encounters into them. Perhaps one of the opponents is a long-term rival of the party or a party member? Perhaps the minions in the encounter will immediately surrender and offer their services if their leader falls before they do? Perhaps the opponent is incredibly cocky and sure to win and will take time on each of their turns to taunt the party and remind them?"
7,"No, as their Shapechanger feature is not described as magical.

Compare this to the Shape Change feature of metallic dragons which is explicitly magical and would be affected by an Antimagic Field. 

I think Werewolves have bigger reasons to be fearful of the tower."
7,DMG 274 will be your friend here. It goes over how to calculate the CR of homebrew monsters.
7,"Recalling generic information is normally just an Intelligence check with no skill proficiency being applied.

If that person is a historical figure or perhaps they're connected to a known family (noble family or a prominent clan, for example), then consider allowing information about such figures to be Intelligence (History) checks."
7,"Making characters will be straight forward enough, you have a PHB already so all you need now is some time, a few pencils/pens and some paper.

For materials to help run a session, I recommend using [the basic rules](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules). Inside, you'll find excerpts of the DMG and MM if you're not fully committed to buying them yet. Best of all, it is a free resource.

I can't speak for the Essentials Kit, but the Starter Set for 5e is very good for helping new DMs get a game going with new players."
7,"What do you mean by a free action?

When an attack of opportunity is provoked, you use your reaction to make a single melee weapon attack. It is not the Attack action."
7,"It's very useful for the first round of combat, especially when threatening elements or lair actions are at play (they act on Initiative Count 20, generally).

Speaking from experience, high initiative is very useful in dealing with complex traps like those in XGtE. I ran one in my game where on Initiative Count 20 of the first round the trap room's doors would slam shut and be locked. Of course, one character rolled a 23 initiative, meaning they were quick enough to act before the doors could close. As a result, they were able to dash out of the room and avoid the trap's damage where they could safely assist from outside. A niche example, I know, but it goes to show that it matters sometimes."
7,"Pros of Strength:

- Higher damage weapons

- More variety in reach weapons

- Shoving/Grappling

- Heavy armour with no speed penalties, with higher ACs compared to light/medium armour

- Lifting heavy objects

- Ramming stuck dungeon doors open

- Climbing

Pros of Dexterity:

- Better ranged weapon options

- A more common saving throw

- Initiative

- Stealth

- Other skill proficiencies that come up less frequently

While Dexterity is certainly more universally useful, the running idea that it is a super stat and outpaces every other ability score is largely overblown. [A while ago, I wrote a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/acxd0z/how_important_is_each_ability_score/) that aimed to give more nuance on each ability score in relation to the three main encounters, and it elucidates the reality that all ability scores have their place in the game (**especially** when you look outside of combat)."
7,"Access to one additional Metamagic option at the cost of a feat seems fine, honestly.

If they're exchanging an increase in their ability scores for more flexibility, then I see it as fair, and one additional metamagic won't go breaking the game."
7,"RAW, if the petrified, wildshaped Druid is reduced to 0 hit points (bearing in mind that they would be resistant to all damage), the would still revert to their Druid form.

Wildshape ending has no effect on existing conditions, so the reverted Druid would still be petrified. 

If they are killed while petrified, petrification does not end (unless the source of petrification says otherwise). Permanent petrification is a deadly condition, as you can see. 

What I recommend instead is a quest to let the party find/make a salve of Greater Restoration or to find a spellcaster NPC capable of casting the spell."
7,"Yes, as you're making a melee weapon attack, anything that could apply to a melee weapon attack can be used. There are some exceptions, such as if the feature requires the Attack action to have been taken.

Cantrips increase in power based on your total level, not individual class levels."
7,"Start small and work out from there.

Rather than focus on a large world all in one go, really focus in on your starting location. Have a small town with maybe a dozen NPCs but put extra effort into making each of them seem real to your players. Like the PCs, each of your NPCs will have their own unique interaction with the current conflict (the adventure). A greater sense of verisimilitude in a small location is far superior to and empty sandbox and the latter is a common trap for fantasy settings especially."
7,"It sounds like a solid foundation for a long term campaign, honestly. Good luck!"
7,"It gets three legendary actions every round, they refresh at the start of the Beholder's turn.

Removing Legendary Actions from a Beholder would roughly half their offensive CR."
7,"Those all sound excellent, each character has a direct, explicit connection to the campaign in some way, which is already more than my players began with."
7,"In regards to subraces, if it's similar enough to an existing subrace that doesn't quite justify making a brand new subrace, just use an existing one. In my own setting, High Elves come in two distinct types with Dale Elves in the North and Sun Elves in the South. Mechanically they're identical but they have their unique histories and culture.

In regards to your plot outline, make sure to consider how the party actually fit in with the campaign. There's no point making a rigid story, you might as well write a novel.

In regards to getting the players started, give them the introduction to your world, the local area, and the upcoming conflict. Get them to make characters explicitly tied to any combination of those three. If they're new, I also recommend starting at level 1. It makes your life and your players' lives easier. There's rarely little to be gained out of starting at 3rd level other than skipping out on ""tutorial levels"" (whatever that means) and it just skips out on exciting adventure at lower levels by making the players play characters that never get to reflect on humble beginnings."
7,"I recommend reading through the DMG as both encounter design and trap design are covered in good detail. This also includes trap damage and DCs, based on their relative threat.

If you want to go a step further, XGtE also does a great job of assisting encounter design and introduces guidelines on making complex traps, traps that are just as interesting as full combat encounters."
7,"It comes down to personal preference, different people find different feats to be overpowered in different contexts.

I honestly don't find any of the feats to be that overpowered, but I do think that Sharpshooter ignoring 1/2 and 3/4 cover all while ignoring range penalties is a little too good compared to other feats. One good houserule I saw was using only one feature of Sharpshooter at a time, so either ignoring cover, ignoring range penalties, or the higher damage attack."
7,"You're right that Matt Mercer often gets ribbed for mispronouncing sigil, but he said in an interview somewhere that it's because he first heard the word ""Sigil"" in Planescape Torment."
7,"Chapter 7 of the DMG covers all three of these questions in great detail, certainly better than a single reddit comment can summarise.

You can absolutely homebrew your own magic items, and I highly recommend every DM does so."
7,It's almost like the different editions want to tell different stories rather than rewriting the same material...
7,"In the 5e sources at least, it's pretty clear between the Monster Manual and MToF that the Gith liberated themselves under the leadership of Gith. If other factors weakened the Illithid and their empires at the same time, they don't seem to have been the main instigator in the Gith's liberation and it is at least implied that the Gith's uprising led to the collapse of the Illithid rule across the multiverse.

The origin story is even muddier, and better for it in my opinion. Nothing is known about the Gith prior to their enslavement, not even their original name. All that is certain is that the Mind Flayers changed them and at the very least were the source of their psionic powers."
7,"I've been reading up on the Gith lately in relation to part of my world so I highly recommend reading through the Gith chapter in Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes. Some old Spelljammer modules are also useful resources, as is the Fiend Folio if you're lucky enough to get a chance to read it. The Fiend Folio was the first D&D book to feature the Gith and it's immediately clear in that book just how science fantasy the Gith are meant to be.

For a rundown, I'll attempt to answer the questions in a rough order. Firstly, the point about slavery vs. ceremorphosis. I am of the opinion that a Mind Flayer colony cannot turn absolutely every humanoid captive into a Mind Flayer. It seems to be quite a resource-intensive process and the Mind Flayers are at least aware that more Mind Flayers in the colony means more brains to harvest, which becomes unsustainable quite quickly. Instead, slaves such as the Gith and the Duergar can prove useful for building Mind Flayer lairs and protecting the colony while being cheaper to sustain than a full Mind Flayer. They're also useful test subjects, and that approach at least seems a plausible origin for the Gith and the Duergar's psionic abilities.

The story of the Gith really begins around the time of their uprising and the race even takes their name from their legendary eponymous leader ""Gith"". There's little information before this point, and I doubt it's that interesting anyway, or at least better left up to mythology and interpretation. Using their numbers and their psionic abilities, the Gith quickly overwhelmed the Illithid in what seems to be a bloody rebellion. The rebellion was successful and the Gith were free, but the split occurs almost immediately. Gith and her followers (who later would become the Githyanki) desired to conquer the Multiverse much like their overlords once had in an act of revenge. However, Zerthimmon (who would later lead the Githzerai) disagreed with this warmongering attitude and desired a life of peace and seclusion for the Gith. This act birthed an endless civil war still seen in the multiverse.

Both factions of Gith will attack each other mercilessly, but they will almost always set aside their differences if it means attacking a Mind Flayer colony, such is their hatred for them. This bloodlust coupled with the hatred of Mind Flayers and a militaristic ideology actually makes up an interesting ""Rite of Passage"" in Githyanki culture where a Githyanki must prove themselves by bringing a slain Mind Flayer head to Vlaakith, the Lich Queen of the Gith. Vlaakith is an interesting character all in herself and how she came to replace Gith is best discussed elsewhere.

Summarised, the Githyanki are a militaristic faction hellbent on revenge and supremacy, much like their former overlords. They ride around the Astral Plane on Astral Skiffs and Barges with Red Dragon allies (yet another interesting story) and enjoy nothing more than hunting decadent luxuries and slaying Mind Flayers. The Githzerai seek an enlightened life and they seem to enjoy the challenge of controlling chaos. It seems directly fitting that their livelihood consists of shaping the plane of Limbo to accommodate their needs, even if they are incredibly ascetic. There are some small factions of Gith that see each other as equals and seek cooperation, such as the Sha'sal Khou, but again that's another tangent that is best discussed elsewhere."
7,"Having a narrative-centric game is completely fine and I'd argue that such a game warrants a lesser focus on balance in combat. After all, in such combats the focus is largely on using your cool abilities to beat up bad guys rather than a tactical struggle.

You're right to point out that it comes down to DM'ing style, but if you're all having fun with it then there's no harm done."

7,"Your DM being lenient with encounters and long resting will cause bigger problems in later levels. If spellcasters don't have to worry about resource expenditure, balancing encounters becomes more difficult and martial characters such as fighter tend to look weaker as they are designed to be more consistent over the course of an adventuring day.

Basically, if a low level Ranger can always cast Hunter's Mark in encounters, the DM isn't challenging the party."
7,"If you're not interested in RAW or with the Prestidigitation cantrip, just go ahead and do it. No one can stop you."

Sure you can give them the cantrip without actually knowing it by letting them mimic spells they already know, but I would just ask them to learn Prestidigitation."
7,Sounds like you're looking for the Cantrip Prestidigitation.
7,"You have to consider two things here. Firstly, you're using spell slots for Hunter's Mark which makes the damage output only sustainable for a few encounters at most. If you're able to use this every encounter, your DM isn't making you face enough encounters between Long Rests.

Secondly, both Hunter's Mark and Two-Weapon fighting compete for the use of your bonus action. You can't be using them both in the same turn. 

Is the multiclass good? Yes. OP? No."
7,"Considering that AC is treated as a total abstraction of a creature's ability to dodge, absorb and deflect blows, it seems quite unintuitive to then separate it into two ""ACs"" for dodge and block respectively. I see why you've created this rule variant, but it's ultimately clunky in practice and poorly worded in description.

As for the usefulness of armour, I'd argue that isn't just early game that heavy armour is superior. Plate and a shield nets a character a solid 20 AC, while studded leather and a shield still requires 20 Dexterity to even get 19 AC. Most characters relying on light armour might also not have proficiency with shields, or will have their hands unable to use one (either by a ranged weapon or two-weapon fighting)."
7,"This just sounds like it would add time to combat (especially having to figure out if an attack hits, misses, glances, and by how much the damage is reduced).

Additionally, this also makes heavy armour less powerful than dexterity, and if there's one thing that's true about 5e it's that Dexterity doesn't need more power in combat."
7,"To my recollection, Aragorn is literally called a ""Ranger"".

7,"The furthest my players went off-piste during a session involved Goblinoids and regicide.

My party were adventuring in the Underdark and had just been ambushed by a flock of goblins riding giant wasps. The goblins themselves had clearly adapted well to life in the Underdark as their skin was significantly paler than their surface brethren and their eyes were wide and bulging to see in the darkness. Rather unlike them, they left one of the goblins alive after the encounter. The goblin, shocked, thought that the party were simply food and never meant to be so vicious. For a relatively merciful turn, the party offered to protect the goblin in exchange for guiding the party to his tribe.

The party arrive to the undergoblin warcamp and quickly learn that the goblins and their domesticated wasps are accompanied by a legion of hobgoblins who have similarly adapted to life in the Underdark. There are no bugbears to be seen and the party learn that they were too slow to adapt and too brazen in combat and found themselves extinct at the hands of Drow. The undergoblins were led by a powerful and respected hobgoblin warlord that was able to keep the tribe prospering in the Underdark, but they still struggled against their neighbouring Drow. My intention was that the party might find seemingly nonhostile goblins endearing, might stay to trade and would continue on their way after a session. My assumptions were wrong.

Instead, the party's fighter and rogue plotted to assassinate the hobgoblin warlord, creating a power vacuum that they could abuse to either distract the Drow or somehow fill. I hadn't prepared for this at all, but I rolled with it, having the two party members mount on a stealth mission into the warlord's home. The rogue successfully eliminated the warlord but the fighter was caught skulking around the perimeter and the warlord's death was immediately attributed to the fighter on account of the suspiciously ""overground"" wounds left on the warlord. At this point in the session, I had to take a break so that I could plan ahead and so that the rest of the party could plan accordingly. I made it clear that regicide was not a crime that would be taken lightly, even in goblinoid society.

Following on from the break, the party were facing the execution of the fighter. The warlock was keen to avoid this at all costs and offered to mediate the issue and avoid the fighter's death. Through some clever thinking and the ability to convince the hobgoblin lieutenants that the warlord's death was a sign of the tribe's weakness and a flaw the Drow could exploit, the party were able to convince the tribe to potentially be an ally. An alliance would come at a cost however, the party had to repay part of their debt by locating a nearby Drow outpost and eliminating the Drow mage in residence. The party setting off into the Underdark again with their quest from the Hobgoblins marked the end of the session.

This major disruption led to the party eventually leading a feuding army of goblinoids through the Underdark and besieging the greater Drow settlement in the area. It was unexpected, but the ability of both my players and myself to be flexible in the situation led to an incredibly memorable month transpiring."
7,"Diving right into a homebrew campaign is fine and certainly doable, but if you are looking for a great introduction campaign, LMoP is perfect for walking new DMs through the process of running a game.

7,"Yes, LMoP is great fun, I have played through it twice and each time was enjoyable.

Those that say it's too long are speaking nonsense, it's quite short and might only take a total of 16-20 hours for a party to complete.

On paper, 3 level 7s will find a CR 13 Adult White Dragon to be a Deadly encounter, but they absolutely could succeed. Rolling LR to 1 or 2 is a good move, though, especially given the smaller party. Stick with 3 if they do roll in with an additional NPC, however.

Perhaps they can take advantage of the dragon's low intelligence and bait it into an advantageous position for the party. Perhaps they can do some research ahead of time and locate items that make dragonslaying easier (such as a Dragon Slayer sword or Arrow of Slaying), or perhaps they can prepare spells or find items that help them resist cold damage. That way the party gets the satisfaction of a victory that was won by their own wits, rather than the encounter being easy, or worse yet ""designed for them to win""."

7,"That's completely fine, thanks for clarifying! If anything, that approach is ""the normal"", whereas awarding experience equally (even to dead PCs) is a houserule. From my experience, the latter seems to be more popular purely to avoid asynchronous leveling, but a level disparity of 1 or 2 won't cause major issues, honestly."

If you're interested in reading the source, [here is a link to the relevant post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6lvo4x/tales_at_the_campfire_getting_players_in/) that Dael used for her own system."
7,"That presents another issue I often see, people often conflate the concept of ""a gaming session"" with ""the adventuring day"".

You're absolutely right that there was a poll done that indicated a majority of just over half of tables running 1-2 combat encounters per session, with the other polls taking 3-4, 5-6 and 6+ in varying amounts. However, that's only 1-2 per session, not adventuring day. An adventuring day represents the adventuring done between the end of one long rest until the end of the next, and that adventuring day could be split over several sessions with a specific table not taking a long rest until the end of a 3rd session, if need be.

Interestingly enough, I find that most DMs struggling to have challenging sessions often run 1 or 2 combat encounters each session but also end every session with a long rest, therefore failing to test the party."
7,"> How do you reconcile the lack of adaptability lack of at will powers

Firstly, I don't. To make it clear once again, I find the lack of social/exploration encounter traits for the Dragonborn lacking.

> Your assuming that all of your enemies will always fail their saves which is not the case scale that 14 back to 7 and then compare it to taking a swing with a piece of metal doing 2d6

I'm not always assuming that enemies fail their saves, I explicitly mentioned in the comment that it can still do damage against a successful save while weapon attacks aren't doing damage on a miss. Your insistence on 7 damage seems to assume that both targets pass, so surely it's only fair to make the same assumption that all weapon attacks miss, no? From there, it's fairer to assume that attacks hit and saving throws fail, in which event a 7+Str is comparable to 14 damage, especially considering the 14 damage requires the expenditure of a resource.

You're absolutely right that Tieflings get 2 spells, one as a 1st-level spell and the other as a 2nd level in some cases. However, they don't replenish until after a Long Rest. Compare this to the Dragonborn which get their singular breath attack back on a Short Rest and the fact that the system is balanced around the assumption that adventurers Short Rest twice between each Long Rest. In reality, and from the designer's point of view, you're comparing the Tiefling's three spells to the Dragonborn's three Breath Weapon attack.

I failed to address the point regarding all the Tiefling variants, which was an oversight on my part. Firstly, looking at the PHB we only have one Tiefling and one Dragonborn, the base for each class. Most of the Tiefling variants were presented in MToF, and I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that a dragon focused sourcebook is in the works that could include Dragonborn variants similar to those Tiefling variants. Perhaps WotC will have Dragonborn variants that are more akin to those of Abeir, who knows."
7,"[I addressed most of these points in another comment already](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/cjr726/ochomebrew_intensified_dragons_breath_revised_a/evh097j/), one which was a reply to you.

Again, I think Dragonborn is perfectly comparable to some Tiefling ancestries, namely the Mephistopheles Tiefling. However, I think they lack something for social/exploration encounters (a point I have made clear in at least 4 comments in this thread alone). I don't think addressing this lack of social/exploration features with more powerful combat features is a good idea (unless the intention is to give players the option to rely more on their breath weapon, again a point I have already mentioned elsewhere).

To combat the insistence that the Breath Weapon is a waste of an action, it's important to consider that it won't be used unless 2 or more targets are available. As you point out, that's 7 damage per target, so assume 14 damage for two targets. At least some of that damage is guaranteed too due to targets taking half damage on a successful save, while missing an attack deals 0. If you're lucky, you could be getting as many as 6 creatures, which is certainly a situation where Breath Weapon is intended to shine."
7,"The Breath Weapon isn't even bad though, after 5th-level it's basically a single use of Burning Hands every Short Rest and it gets better from there. Dragonborn are perfectly comparable to Tieflings in many regards, so I'm uncertain as to why many are keen to dunk on their Breath Weapon. My instinct is many playing a Dragonborn Sorcerer or Paladin where their Constitution score will likely be their third-highest ability score.

I think the bigger, more often overlooked issue of the Dragonborn is that they get no racial bonuses to social/exploration encounters. If you want to address their balance with regard to other race options, giving them something for those encounters is better than overpowering their already balanced breath weapon."
7,"The core rulebooks are a great start, so since you have the Player's Handbook you'll want to invest in the Monster Manual and Dungeon Master's Guide.

A first adventure is also required, and it doesn't need to be anything too spectacular. Make a local area, have a villain or an evil faction and a source of tension for the party to resolve. Dress it all up with sidequests and NPCs and you have yourself a great foundation for a campaign. It could be something as simple as a Hobgoblin Warlord's expansion threatening a small farming town's livelihood, causing some brave townsfolk (the party) to take up arms.

If you want to go beyond that, I recommend writing down your own world, perhaps even with a world map if that interests you. That sort of stuff is all peripheral though, and certainly isn't required to being the campaign."
7,"Steal your puzzles from other sources.

Professor Layton games and Zelda dungeons are my go-to, but any sort of game with puzzle elements is great for inspiration."
7,"I think my main criticism is being completely lost on many here. I understand that OP is being creative, and I clearly appreciate that. However, I don't think it's exactly fair to title this feat as a ""balanced"" breath weapon when it only exists to deliberately overpower it."
7,"Definitely treat that part of the adventure as an absolute sandbox where the players are encouraged to search around and talk to NPCs for their next quest or clue. If it does get to a point where they are lost or unsure as to what to do, you can have an NPC approach them and try to get the momentum back."
7,"No recommended order, or even requirement, of events. The first time I played through LMoP, we ignored Thundertree entirely and only visited Tressendar Manor because we saw it on the map and wanted something to do."
7,"I agree, I never said it wasn't."
7,"The Bag of Holding describes it as a random location on the Astral Plane. As I interpret it, that would open a gate to somewhere else on the plane."
7,"I've discussed these points with OP in the adjacent thread.

The Breath Weapon shouldn't be compared to class features, it should be compared to other racial traits. Comparing the Breath Weapon to the racial spellcasting of some Tiefling ancestries is a much fairer comparison, and it's clear from such a comparison that the standard breath weapon is fairly balanced and that the above feat is only recommended if you want to allow a Dragonborn PC to truly rely on their breath weapon instead of their class features."
7,I love the tables in XGtE for encounter building. They remove the faff and hassle of number crunching and replace it with easily referenced tables to build encounters. You can find them in Chapter 2 of the book.
7,"> Missions wrapping together?

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this. If you're asking if quests beginning in Phandalin end in Phandalin, this is generally the case as adventurers will want to return to the quest giver to receive their reward.

> NPCs/DMPCs

What you're describing here is traditionally referred to as a ""DMPC"", or a DM player character. Generally, they are not recommended because of the obvious biases that the DM will have in regards to running such a character. NPCs that travel with the party are fine, but they need motivations beyond ""I must travel with the party."" For NPCs, creating them using PC rules is completely fine, though you could also use the NPC statblocks in the Appendix B of the Monster Manual.

Overall, most of your questions can easily be answered by referring to the index at the back of the Basic Rules or the PHB and reading the relevant rules."
7,"While raging, Barbarians have resistance to piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage.

Totem Barbarians with the Bear feature at level 3 upgrade this to resistance to all damage except psychic while raging.

There are no RAW Barbarian subclasses that make this resistance constant, but 20th level Barbarians can rage an unlimited number of times."
7,Where in the PHB does it state that? I have never seen it before.
7,"No worries, that addresses my initial concern then. So many feats like this aim to provide a ""fix"" for the Breath Weapon, even though it's fine as is. If this is just aimed to deliberately overpower the trait, that's fine.

In regards to it being less useful into tier 2 and beyond, I'd argue that's by design. If you compare the Breath Weapon to class features, of course it pales at higher levels. I think the feature is better compared to the Innate Spellcasting traits of other races, however. Making that comparison, it's easily seen that the Breath Weapon is generally more powerful than racial spellcasting, especially the closest comparison of Mephistopheles Tieflings in MToF.

FWIW, the Dragonborn breath weapon is still incredibly useful at higher tiers in my experience. This is especially true when martial characters such as Paladins, Fighters and Barbarians are facing up against numerous, weak minions."
7,"My point was more what flaws, if any, do you see in the feature that help justify the creation of this feat?

I really like Dragonborn too, one of my setting's largest civilizations is composed of them. That said, I think their weaknesses stem from their total lack of features that are useful outside of combat, buffing their breath weapon doesn't provide a solution to that. Unlike other player races, Dragonborn get nothing that help them in social/exploration encounters."
7,"What exact issues do you have with the current Dragonborn breath weapon? As I see it, it's balanced already as the breath weapon isn't intended to be a replacement for class features but rather a useful tool in some situations. This feat just serves to make it much more powerful than it should be, in my opinion. 

I have been running a Dragonborn in my campaign for two years and I have never found the breath weapon to be underpowered. My only gripe with the race is that there are no social/exploration traits for them, unlike other races."
7,"RAW, there are no restrictions as to what weapons characters might use while mounted.

7,"In my experience, scheduling is the number one issue in maintaining a long term campaign. My current campaign has been running for two years and I think a reliable schedule has been the core of that.

A committed group is also essential. You need a DM that cares about running the game and you need players that care about their characters and the world."
7,"In addition to PHB 6, contests are also covered on PHB 174:

> If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest.

For Grapples, the most common contested ability check, that means that ties result in nothing changing. A creature trying to grapple does not grapple, or in the case of a creature using their action to escape a grapple, they fail to escape."
7,Primarily conjuring spells might cause an issue. I think it can be argued that there's a good reason that Sorcerers don't traditionally get access to many of those spells.
7,"I was more thinking specifying a cast time to avoid the potential interpretation that mirroring spells that normally take 1 minute or longer to cast would be allowed.

I would argue that 2 sorcery points to mirror a 1st-level spell being the same as a 9th-level spell doesn't make too much sense, for obvious reasons. Making mirroring spells like Foresight or Wish cost more seems like a reasonable change."
7,"Not so much the creators in general, but rather Gygax's vision was closer to the world of Conan the Barbarian and Jack Vance's novels rather than the more fantastical setting of Lord of the Rings. To say Gygax didn't like LotR is a stretch."
7,"I'm not entirely sure Tolkien's approach to worldbuilding and storytelling would be all that great for DMing, to be honest.

His approach to worldbuilding was a very involved one where he created entire languages and mythologies just to base his stories in. I'm sure there are plenty anecdotes of him being fairly charismatic and engaging, but I'm not so sure his talents as a writer directly translate to the qualities that define a good DM."
7,"Does this work against all spells within 60ft or only spells that target the sorcerer themselves? I'm guessing it's the former?

I can't see any balance issues at all, honestly. Spending two sorcery points just to cast a spell that you might not otherwise have access too doesn't sound too broken. I think it could be clarified that the spell must require an action/bonus action, just to be more airtight.

I'm confused as to why it consumes 1 sorcery point and then another sorcery point on the next turn though? I think using a reaction to ""copy the spell in memory"" and then on the next turn spending a spell slot and sorcery points equal to the spell's level (cantrips count as 1) to cast it seems fairer. I'm also assuming that normal spellcasting rules apply with components being required as normal?"
7,"I have a big backlog of undead encounters, but this one is definitely being added to it!"

7,"If you treat the ground as one giant object (which in a sense it is), then ghosts moving through it should be fine.

When I run creatures with Incorporeal Movement, I have always allowed them to travel through the ground as required, bearing in mind that it's dangerous for them to end their turn in the ground. Whether or not this is RAW or RAI, I don't care, it works and hasn't caused any issues at my table."

7,"Tunnelling through a castle wall would be quite challenging, especially given that some are several feet of limestone thick. There's a reason why catapults and trebuchets were popular in medieval times. Digging through with manual tools could take days, honestly."
7,"There's a resemblance to a younger Sean Bean here, very nice artwork!"
7,"Is your table even practical at all? You've taken a fairly reasonable linear scale (damage/fall height) and transposed it to an arbitrary equation that has many more factors and has to be referenced whenever a fall happens.

I think the only other rule that needs to be reasonably considered is the rule for falling flying creatures when they're knocked prone. Subtracting flight speed from the distance fallen before calculating damage is elegant and works seamlessly with what is already there."
7,"Not RAW, no.

There are rules to avoid falling prone when landing on difficult terrain after a jump (a DC 10 Dex (Acrobatics) iirc)

Of course, using the Acrobatics skill to safely land from a height makes perfect sense. I like to set a DC equal to the height fallen to land safely without taking damage. A 20ft drop would require a DC 20 Dex (Acrobatics) check, for example. It works well, so I recommend it."
7,"The Hexblaxe patron's specifics are intentionally left vague, it isn't clear if the patron is some shadowy, metaphysical concept, a specific sentient weapon, the Raven Queen, or some variation of those.

This gives you some options to decide what the patron is specifically, and I recommend all Warlocks work with their DM to create their own, unique patron as it should be an important character much like the Warlock themselves. 

For jumping off points, you can read about the Raven Queen and her Shadar-Kai in Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, the Shadowfell is covered in the DMG as well as in MToF, and of course there is the flavour text available for Hexblades in XGtE. 

Hexblades can still take any pact they wish. They are not forced to take Pact of the Blade, but it just happens to be one of the most popular combos."
7,"I have been DMing the same campaign for two years, and there have only been 5 PC deaths despite a relatively constant level of threat across the tiers. Every time a PC died, both myself and the party were fine with it. A PC death can often be a spark for new stories within the campaign, so it can often be a good thing. 

In later tiers, death becomes easily resolvable. Spells like Revivify and Raise Dead become readily available in Tier 2 and as a result, only 3 of the 5 PC deaths have actually been permanent. 

If I were to run a game where no PCs died because I made the game easier, the players would know straight away and I think their experience would be worse for it. That is just my opinion though."
7,"Firstly, is it the player or their character being stubborn?

If the player is being difficult, remind them that it's a group activity and their stubbornness will negatively affect everyone else's fun. 

If the character is being difficult, perhaps they're role-playing a flaw. However, if it is bringing the game to a halt, remind the player that they created an adventurer."
7,"You learn Mage Hand both from Tiefling (Mammon Ancestry) and Mage Hand Legerdemain. You can cast them using either your Charisma or Intelligence score respectively, however there isn't any difference for the purpose of Mage Hand. As a result, you effectively only get two new Cantrips from Arcane Trickster 3.

Selecting another Tiefling ancestry would change the cantrip you start with, of course."
7,"Narrow corridors or bridges might be a good start. Avoiding having a combat encounter's environment be the same as every other one is a must.

You could also change the enemies you use, there are some monsters that actively punish clustering round them from aura effects or other abilities. Salamanders, Remorhaz, Balor, and my personal favourite the Venom Troll all come to mind."
7,"Cover rules should apply even if it is just one sizable creature blocking the way. ""Another creature"" is actually listed as an example of what might count as half cover.

If a target creature is surrounded, then making a melee attack isn't possible unless you have reach over the blocking creatures or can somehow move one of the creatures out of the way. Letting creatures squeeze in and out to make attacks can make for very messy scenarios when dealing with hordes of creatures especially.

Edit: PHB 191-192 describes how many creatures can fit around another creature under the section on Space. This obviously changes with both target creature and surrounding creature sizes."
7,"http://criticalrolepodcast.geekandsundry.com/

https://critrole.com/podcast/

Episodes are split between G&S and Critical Role's sites, with the more recent episodes being on Crit Role's website. They are available for download to listen offline."
7,"Alert means you cannot be surprised while you are conscious. Surprise is determined at the start of a combat encounter before any attacks go off, and there are no attacks before combat.

I recommend reading PHB 189 for more information about determining surprise in combat."
7,"In the descriptions of the Eladrin, their meals are described as being very heavily seasoned to the point that all non-Fey food tastes completely bland to them. Perhaps the Fey meal features rare herbs and spices from across the continent?"
7,"As it doesn't specify taking the Attack action and making a melee weapon attack, casting Booming Blade/Green-Flame Blade both qualify for the Centaur's charge feature as you make a melee weapon attack as part of the spell."
7,"Two actions to make special attack really doesn't work well with the system's action economy.

As pointed out already, Recharge (X-Y) or features with limited use do a better job of providing more powerful attacks without skewing the action economy."
7,"You joke, but there are some players that need warning signals to be that obvious! Haha"
7,"No, you either pick the Lizardfolk Natural Defence or the Barbarian's Unarmoured Defence for your AC calculation, they do not stack."
7,"Some parts of the world should be explicitly dangerous, the same way that parts of the world are peaceful.

The important thing for the players to consider is that retreat must always be an option. As DM, it's your job to make sure they know this and to communicate when an encounter may put them out of their depth.

Sticking with your example, perhaps the town has local rumours of a nearby cave riddled with webs stronger than steel wire and with spiders that can cut down a troll. This signals to the party that the cave is dangerous, but perhaps worth investigating at a later level. But say they do venture towards the cave, what now? Communicate even greater danger. Perhaps they near the cave and they see a dying manticore caught in a gargantuan web, clearly woven by a spider the likes of which they have never seen. As it stands, a Manticore might already be a fair challenge for the party, so these spiders will likely make quick work of them. But say that still doesn't stop them, the danger needs to become present. Perhaps they face up against a Drider (CR 6) who has the explicit goal of driving off the invaders. At that point, you make it clear to the players that the monstrous spider is deadlier than anything they have faced so far. Should they fight it, that's their decision. If they retreat, that's good, it gives the party something to work towards. If a PC dies, they were warned!"
7,"If you want to limit how magical PCs can be in a low magic campaign, you could implement some restriction such as PCs only being able to learn up to 4th level spells or perhaps you can only be the equivalent of a 7th-level spellcaster (as per the PHB's multiclassing table). It could just be in your world that it is impossible for a mortal to be a more powerful spellcaster than some arbitrary limit that you set."
7,"Yes, and you'd also get the advantage on Dex saves as well as the extra action granted by Haste."
7,"As you're a Paladin, have spells like Shield of Faith and Aid prepared. Other than that, your AC will be pretty highly optimised on account of using the very powerful Warforged."
7,"Assuming 5e

It is just a melee weapon attack as your reaction. It is not considered the attack action."
7,"""Surprise round"" doesn't appear in the 5e core rulebooks, it is a holdover from previous editions.

Mechanically, there are differences between the Surprised condition and a surprise round, especially important when dealing with the Rogue Assassin feature."
7,"You need to make it clear that creating magic items requires a lot of knowledge and is a difficult process. These might only be a Mace+1 and Breastplate+1, but those are relatively rare items in the world. Your PCs might have never seen them before, so a lot of the work goes into how you describe the appearance and history of both items. 

Players quickly become jaded to magic items when they're just ""Weapon+1"" or ""Armour+1"" when they can be so much more. That mace, perhaps it is imbued with an adamantine core so that its blows may shatter the toughest of dragon scales. Perhaps it has scripture dedicated to Mystra on the haft revealing an ancient prayer once thought lost to the ages. That breastplate, perhaps it's crafted from a single plate of Umber Hulk chitin, giving it the appearance of bronze but making it more resistant than any steel so far witness by the party. Your descriptions make these items come to life, not the numbers on the handouts.

Additionally, you can always frame it that the Forge of Spells is waning in power. However, despite years of neglect it is still capable of imbuing items with relatively powerful magic, so imagine what it must have been like in its prime?

Edit: You don't even need to do the effort of paragraph 2, the adventure does this for you!"
7,That is precisely my point. Some players and DMs are comfortable with the idea that they understand a rule without referencing it or reading it in full.
7,"In my experience, most people who get confused by that spellcasting rule only get confused because a DM/player attempted to paraphrase it to them rather than them actually reading what is written in the book.

It's this exact course of action that leads to people getting confused about the Surprised condition and why the term ""surprise round"" so often comes up."
7,"Which edition?

Assuming 5e: Do they have vulnerability to radiant damage?

5e Vampires aren't vulnerable to radiant damage, but it does suppress their Regeneration feature."
7,"Bards don't need to play their instrument to perform a spell's material components, it's a common misconception. Bards can hold their lute in one hand and still supply a spell's material component just fine."
7,"Scotland, that is as specific as I'm willing to be. :)"
7,"I'm flattered! I already have a steady local group that I would never change, but I'm always happy to share my own experience on this subreddit."
7,"DMG 135 has a recommendation for magic item prices. Uncommon magic items are between 101-500gp.

XGtE elaborates further on this by making magic item trades require downtime. I recommend reading through XGtE 126 for more information and ideas for your own campaign."
7,"In my setting, elemental confluence produce extreme weather. Air yields extreme gales and hurricanes; Earth yields dust storms and earthquakes; Fire yields heatwaves, wild fires and volcanic eruptions; Water yields tsunamis, floods and storms.

For the Feywild and Shadowfell, I use a slightly modified long term madness. When resting near Fey Crossings, mortals may experience bouts of mania or obsessiveness. When resting near Shadow Crossings, mortals may experience bouts of depression or hopelessness.

For the Abyss, I like using the Abyssal Corruption of the Sibriex or the Indefinite Madness tables from the DMG."
7,"For religious groups, the worry isn't the content of the media itself, but rather the group's (or religion's) inability to control the content of the media.

If you compare Scrooby Doo to something curated specifically for a strictly religious audience, the difference is clear. The movie series ""God is not dead"" is quite a humorous example. The messages and morals in such content are clearly designed to align with their beliefs exclusively and allow no room to challenge existing beliefs, other than for the purpose of making their own beliefs seem all the more righteous."
7,"Your ruling was fine. If you retcon it now so that sorcerer is dead, I don't think your players will be too happy."
7,What do you find fun?
7,Play whatever you find most fun.
7,"It's classically used for poking the floor, walls, and ceilings of dungeons ahead of you to help detect any traps.

You could also use it to check pools of water for hostiles or simply to check if it is a safe depth."
7,"This is a very vague question.

We know literally nothing about your campaign, the adventures, the party or the BBEG. 

Do you have any ideas as to how you might lead into the next adventure?"
7,"If you're dealing with a crazy religious family, what they don't approve is going to be completely fluid and will not have any grounds in rationality at all.

Storm King's Thunder should be fine, as would Princes of the Apocalypse (perhaps dressing up all the Tharizdun references to be sure). That said, don't be surprised if the family have some kneejerk reaction to D&D and reference the satanic panic regardless of what you run."
7,"Only alignment and personality are retained when a creature is affected by True Polymorph. Existing spellcasting traits are not retained.

If you target a wizard with True Polymorph and turn them into a Mind Flayer, they lose their own spellcasting and would instead adopt the spellcasting traits of the Mind Flayer."
7,"Compared to other Artefacts presented within the DMG, this is quite a weak item. 

Advantage on some spell saves, a reduction to spell copying costs (but not time), a daily 5th-level spell, and advantage on Intelligence ability checks using certain proficiencies would put it at Rare, or Very Rare at a push.

It is an interesting item though and with some appropriate lore, I'm sure it would fit in well to your game."
7,"To avoid multiclassing, you could talk to your DM about playing as a Githyanki. That gets you both a bonus to Str and Int as well as proficiency in Light/Medium armour. From there, all you need is the Heavily Armoured feat for the heavy armour proficiency.

As already mentioned, War Magic is great for playing a defensive wizard and spells like Blur or Mirror Image will make you even more survivable. Abjuration is also great for being a tank, in a pinch."
7,"Nothing RAW one way or the other.

Ask your DM."
7,"Rounds are mostly useful abstractions in combat encounters. If you're casting a ritual in combat, then yes it will take ages (but then again, why would you?) 

Out of combat, assume time flows normally without worrying about rounds.

So long as you maintain concentration and can provide the components over the duration of the ritual, there are no limits to what you can do. You could be cast a ritual while walking along a road, if you really wanted to."
7,That is the spell working as intended. Prepare Plane Shift if you plan on staying inside a Demiplane.
7,"It gives you proficiency in Nature/Survival if you don't already have them. In addition, proficiency bonuses with ability checks using either skill are doubled. This does not stack with Expertise as the two features do the same thing."
7,"Perhaps they kept a record of the nature of their Demiplane and what it hid in an encoded tome allowing another spellcaster with the ability to cast the spell access to the Demiplane?

Alternatively, perhaps the Demiplane withers after time due to neglect and its contents are ejected into the Astral Plane. You could have a Githyanki barge find the hidden treasure and then cast in with the rest of the treasures in Tu'unarath."
7,"I use electrum to indicate that something is likely belonging to an ancient civilization. Much like the players, the current kingdoms and empires of my setting also find the currency unwieldy and confusing so they don't mint the coins. Of course, the metal is still valuable and the currency is seldom refused.

However, if the players find a tattered coffer of electrum coins in a dragon's lair, they can be pretty certain that the coins are ancient and rare. Merchants, shopkeepers, and travelers will often carry electrum coins as symbols of Tymora in the hopes that bad luck avoids them."
7,"Firstly, the only RAW here is how you write it. If playing the flute only counts as your turn's object interaction, that's up to you and it's perfectly valid.

If you're instead letting a PC use the flute to gain the benefit of Greater Invisibility without using their action at all, then it certainly gets more powerful. The ability to use your action as normal and then immediately become invisible will be useful in combat."
7,"Having to play a flute to maintain Greater Invisibility isn't very useful. For one, you're making noise. Your hands are also occupied by the flute itself, as is your mouth, so doing anything useful such as attacking or casting other spells is now impossible.

It's a good joke item, however, but that's about it."
7,"> I don't know if the idea of alien technology or super computers from the distant future/past is too crazy for a d&d campaign

Nothing is too crazy for a D&D campaign. [A classic module written by Gygax himself was literally a crashed spaceship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedition_to_the_Barrier_Peaks) that functioned as a dungeon, including futuristic devices like power armour and laser weapons.

DMG 268 has a good guide on how to go about including alien technology into your own setting, I highly recommend reading through it."
7,"Work with the players and what they have made. If they want to spend their time screwing and looting a path through the setting, let them do that. It will likely create some serious trouble for them to deal with, but that's what adventuring is about."
7,"I use electrum in my games, so that's at least one."
7,"[ Any ]

Does anyone have any links to resources on the written Gith languages? I've been reading up on the Gith in MToF recently and the written language is referenced on page 90 but there are no visual references"
7,"It's important to consider that Crawford was replying to a question that specified two ""loaded"" hand crossbows."
7,"No worries, I think the concepts are often poorly named, as picking up a blue shell while you're last in Mario Kart is an example of a ""negative feedback loop"" while a squaddie dying in XCOM is an example of a ""positive feedback loop"". It's a common sticking point in many game design lessons that ""negative can be good"" and ""positive can be bad""."
7,"In the case of a hand crossbow using the Repeating Shot infusion, it would be able to be fired while the other hand is full.

However, if the hand crossbow in the off-hand is a standard, uninfused hand crossbow, it still cannot be reloaded.

FWIW, Arcane Armament only specifies that at least one attack must be made with a magical weapon. Both attacks could be made with the infused hand crossbow, if desired."
7,"I don't think it would require updates to the core rulebooks. It could likely be brought out in a playtest UA, to be honest.

In game design, a negative feedback loop describes a situation where the game is more likely to return to a ""balanced state"". For the bloodied condition, this is where taking damage often gives you abilities to stay alive or monsters becoming more deadly as they take damage. The items in Mario Kart are another excellent example of a negative feedback loop.

Contrast this to a positive feedback loop where success increases the chance of success and failure increases the chance of failure. The XCOM games and other strategy games are great examples of positive feedback loops, as are things like killstreaks in the Call of Duty games."
7,"I really like the bloodied mechanic from 4e, adding it back into 5th Edition would not be a tall order at all though. Some creatures like the Quaggoth even have features that come into effect when being reduced below a certain HP. Adding similar features to other monsters and homebrewing bloodied features for classes wouldn't be as hard as you make out, I think.

It certainly was more integral to 4e's design, I'll concede, but that's largely because 4e was heavily designed around the negative feedback loop that the bloodied condition provides."
7,"If the hand crossbows are both loaded before you attack, yes. They cannot be reloaded until a free hand is available though."
7,"Though there's nothing RAW about this, but in my game if creatures are trying to communicate while speaking in different, but related languages, I let them make an Intelligence check to attempt to understand the literal meaning of what they said or a Wisdom (Insight) check to understand what they intend. I normally make the DC 15, but that can go up or down depending on the languages at play and the character's experience."
7,"Yes, but it does not remove the ammunition property of crossbows.

Crossbow Expert allows you to make more than one attack on your turn with a crossbow by ignoring the loading property. It does not let you reload without using a free hand."
7,"Unless a feature removes the ammunition property of a ranged weapon or if the weapon/character has a feature allowing it to be reloaded using the same hand holding the weapon, you cannot effectively dual-wield crossbows.

The ammunition property of ranged weapons requires a free hand for reloading."
7,"These can all be achieved within 5e by creating adventures and campaign settings.

Nothing you mentioned is specific to the system itself."
7,"What you're describing is often referred to as ""theatre of the mind"", so called because all the action happens in everyone's collective imagination without the reliance on a grid and miniatures.

Putting emphasis on the relative distances between the monster(s) and the party is important, so you may need to spend more time describing that in the encounter."
7,"RAW, I'm inclined to say yes.

Nothing about the Ring of Spell Storing says that the spell cast has to be cast using a specific feature or that it excludes casting into the ring from magic items. Disguise Self is a 1st-level spell, so it's eligible to be cast into a Ring of Spell Storing and it takes up one slot worth of space.

Of course, you would have to use the base DC of the Hat of Disguise, [which would be the spell save DC of a spellcaster or 8+proficiency from a non-spellcaster.](https://www.sageadvice.eu/2015/11/27/hat-of-disguise-dc/)"
7,"If you're the DM, read through the adventure and find out.

If you're a player, let your PC find out for themselves."
7,"That's sort of what I was getting at without explicitly stating, but thanks for making it obvious.

The best part about the ""walls"" of the encounter being troops is that they can move and change the bounds of the encounter."
7,"Yes, you can. (assuming you mean Extra Attack and not Multiattack) 

If you really wanted, you could replace both of the Attack action attacks with shoves and make three shoves in your turn."
7,"Cinematic battle scenes. Think of every Hollywood depiction of a battle you have seen, quite often its two large armies clashing in the background while the ""champions"" of each side fight in a convenient clearing in the melee. Here the champions are the party against whatever encounter monsters.

When I have run cinematic battles in the past, I had encounters happen as normal within a bound defined by the clearing. On initiative count 20, I rolled a d20 to see if anything happened. On a 1-3, for example, the enemy gain some ground and something bad happens to the party. On an 18-20, the allies gain ground and something good happens for the party.

Here, a 1-3 might be something like arrow fire raining on the party members, or a ballista bolt being fired at one of the PCs. It might even be enemy minions coming from the melee surrounding them into the main encounter itself.

An 18-20 would be the opposite. Perhaps a rallying cry comes forth and the PCs have advantage on the first attack roll they make on their next turn. Perhaps it is allied archers firing on the enemy champions? Obviously, these results change depending on the parameters of the battle.

With every success the party has, reflect that in the lines shifting as the allied advance nears victory. Also give them objectives like capturing siege equipment or securing advantageous ground. This effect could decrease the enemies reinforcement chances or increase the allies chances."
7,"Lair actions? Absolutely, they can be nice too. I think the perfect example of lair actions comes from the dragon statblocks. Their inconsequential enough not to bump up a dragon's CR for that encounter and they all follow a similar pattern: One lair action deals damage, one presents an obstacle, one debuffs an enemy creature.

With a Chimera, perhaps the inherit their lair actions from the dragon component of them. By default, a chimera would get the red dragon lair actions, but with my homebrew, they would get the black dragon lair actions."
7,"XGtE has a table for solo encounters. For a challenging encounter at those levels and numbers, I recommend CR 9. If they are more competent or decked out with magic items and you think they can handle it, consider CR 10.

I forgot to mention earlier, but when dealing with boss monsters at CR 7 and above, absolutely give them legendary actions. I gave my Chimera a few legendary actions and it definitely helped make the combat more memorable."
7,"Seeing that you have added in an edit for level, be very careful with a Beholder. Level 5s will be annihilated, perhaps consider one of the lower CR Beholderkin in Volo's or a Chimera (tweaking the monster's it is made up of can change the CR too)."
7,"I have used all three, and they certainly each cover different tiers of play.

I don't like using solo mind flayers. If I use them, it has to be a full mind flayer colony. That means various mind flayers with class levels, intellect devourers, thralls and an Elder Brain are all there. 

Beholders are great fun, when I ran one it had taken over a Duergar stronghold. Under its control it had an army of Duergar as well as clockwork soldiers (from Tome of Beasts) to protect the lair. The item the players were tasked with retrieving was also at the core of the Beholder, as the item had manifested itself into the monster.

For Chimeras, I love changing what their constituent monsters are to make them more interesting. The most recent was a Black Dragon, Cave Bear, and Spider hybrid. It was as terrifying as it sounds.

As for which one is most fun? The Chimera made the best combat encounter but the Beholder had the best lair. For so long the players thought that a psionic Duergar King was the evil monster guarding the artefact, but they immediately knew something was wrong when they saw the former king as an insane, rambling husk of his former self in one of the chambers."
7,"I wouldn't allow that, no.

Major Illusion, as designed, is very powerful in social encounters and has some use in exploration encounters. Giving it extra utility in combat makes it more useful than it should be."
7,You could read through Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage and decide for yourself which ones you like best?
7,"Not inherently. I'm sure even the most lawful good paladins enjoy slaying fiends and undead alike. 

The lines start to blur when the targets are less recognised as evil, but I wouldn't attribute a ""thrill of the hunt"" attitude as an evil one.

Killing isn't a moral issue, but murder would be viewed as an evil act."
7,"Whenever you take damage and are concentrating on a spell, you roll a Constitution Saving Throw. The DC is equal to 10 or half the damage taken, whichever value is higher.

In the specific instance you quote, an 8 on your concentration check would fail, as it is lower than 10.

For all other saves, you need to roll at or above the DC (meet, or beat). This is true for save/check DCs, and hitting AC."
7,"Oh they're not mine, I'm sure they're explicitly stated in the production of the movies. I likely picked it up from some behind the scenes footage, I absolutely can't take credit for the thought."
7,"Does training need an ability check? Probably not. If you were to pick one, however, just make it an ability check using the ability that the class depends most on. Str/Dex for a Fighter, Cha for a Bard, Int for a Wizard, Dex/Wis for a Monk, etc. 

In my games, I let the players train up NPCs in whatever skills they have. By spending some gold and some downtime, they can train an NPC to be a lesser version of their own class. I always rule that they must have at least 5 levels in the class to be considered ""experienced enough"", and every 5 levels thereafter allows for better training.

Taking a Warlock as an example, they spent a month training up a new cultist to lead their devil cult while they're off adventuring. As a cult leader, the NPC got access to a diluted form of the Warlock class (essentially, a level 1 Warlock). The specific levels of the NPC doesn't actually matter too much, but it does help convey the fact that they are a dilute version of their master's class.

I think your approach with a Wisdom check was good, but I'd definitely consider allowing other ability scores if the player's reasoning is sufficient. I also think spending downtime and gold is important here too."
7,"Surely they would all use some variation of banners and heraldry? If it's good enough for one culture, the idea would spread and quickly be adopted by other cultures, especially when identifying allied buildings/people by sight is important.

Perhaps the colours, patterns and symbols would vary wildly between them. Dwarves will likely favour tools as their symbols, such as anvils, hammers, axes, etc. Elves may chose to adopt symbols closer to nature or the Fey such as rivers, eagles, sprites, etc. 

For patterns, I like what the Lord of the Rings movies did. The Dwarves had artistic features that were very reminiscent of the art deco movement, while elves had artistic features more closely resembling to art nouveau movement."
7,"Object damage types are covered on DMG 247

By default, all objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but as already pointed out, glass would likely have a vulnerability to bludgeoning damage (and perhaps also thunder damage).

Iron having resistance doesn't really make sense, perhaps just increase its hit points instead?"
7,"That 2-week figure comes more as a limit for empires, not kingdoms. Empires are significantly larger, compare something like the Roman Empire to the early medieval kingdoms of Britain."
7,"If the roads are damaged and the terrain counts as difficult for the purpose of travel, then it certainly seems feasible. 3-6 weeks still sounds very distant, though, that's 250-500 miles even when considering difficult terrain. Perhaps putting everything closer will be more reasonable?"
7,"It seems so, though it isn't entirely clear if the second part of Improved Pact Weapon applies to all Pact Weapons or just weapons created with the pact weapon feature.

As a Flame Tongue has no bonus to attack/damage rolls by default, making it your Pact Weapon while you have the Improved Pact Weapon feature would make give it a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls."
7,"I recommend reading through the guides on magic item distribution and perhaps also creation in both the DMG and XGtE. The guides/tables for how much magic items of which rarity a party could expect at each tier of the game is a useful way to structure your adventure's rewards.

Giving them +1 Weapons and Armour is fine, but you have to consider that it will make the party more powerful, meaning encounter balance has to be reconsidered. To also quote Syndrome, ""When everyone's weapons are magical, no ones are."" Magic items are best used when they are infrequent and special. If it is nothing but a ""Sword +1"", then the party won't really connect to the item itself, they'll only focus on the mechanical benefits of it and you may find them playing the game just to chase magic items.
[
I wrote a relevant comment to a post yesterday on the matter of magic items and how to make them special](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/cgby1z/weapons_for_my_group/eufyrt8/). It's useful here and I don't want to just copy it entirely."
7,"I can't remember where I read/heard this, but a good principal for Empires is that you should be able to reach any point on the Empire's frontier from the capital within 2 weeks. This gives a range that obviously fluctuates with terrain and available technology, as well as the exerted pressure from other empires' borders.

In my setting, the main Empire the campaign revolves around has good roads and horses are fairly common. As a result, each frontier sits approximately two weeks on horseback from the capital with each being 200 to 300 miles away.

For a smaller kingdom, frontiers 60-120 miles away work well too, especially if there are many kingdoms on the continent.

That said, I recommend creating a large world that the players primarily focus on a small region in. That gives you one really detailed area for the adventure which the players will appreciate with a larger world in the background that will give the players a sense that the world is really vast and alive."
7,"Starting level is entirely up to you and your group. Personally I prefer starting at level 1, but I understand why starting at level 3 is so popular. You could even start at level 10 or higher if you really wanted to.

To determine starting level, ask two questions:

- What level do the group want to start at?

- What level are you comfortable starting the campaign at?"
7,"No worries, it is really easy to miss. I only picked up on it when I went about homebrewing a Warlock patron too."
7,"It really depends on what your party can contribute to encounters as well as your own personal preference.

Generally, having one spell of each of the categories you list should be useful as a base, then pick whatever works best from there. 

As a sorcerer, your metamagic may inform your spell choice too. Heightened spell may appeal more if you focus on debuffs while distant spell may appeal more if you focus on support/damage spells."

7,"The Expanded Spell List doesn't make any sense as the majority are already on the Warlock spell list and available to all Warlocks.

Instead, look at the PHB patrons and note how each expanded spel list simply adds to that Warlock's spell list by adding spells that are not available on the default spell list or via Eldritch Invocations."
7,"Not to sound glib, but the basic reminders are the combat and spellcasting chapters in the PHB. Is there anything specifically that is causing issue?"

I don't mean to discount random tables and lists either, reading through them for inspiration is always great, especially to get a feel of what you could do."
7,Oathbreaker Paladins get Inflict Wounds from their oath spells.
7,"I'm really not a fan of these giant lists of lifeless random encounters. Most of them consist of combat encounters that range wildly in difficulty and the rest consist of social/exploration encounters that might not hold any relevance in my world.

Instead, I like to create a list of 10 bespoke encounters that are tailored to the area the party is in. They could be anything but it is important to tie them into the area, and possibly even the adventure as a whole. Ten might not seem like a lot, but you have to consider that you're very unlikely to go through more than ten encounters in one session. When you want an encounter to happen, pick one from the list (you can even roll a d10 if you really want to).

Once you have used an encounter from your random collection, get writing more encounters until you have a list of 10. With this method, nothing gets wasted but the overall level of quality is considerably higher than procedurally generated lists or random tables."
7,"It looks like you'll want to homebrew your own archfey. Look through the monster creation guide in the DMG and decide what the King and Queen may fight like. You may want to start off with which character class levels each monarch may have and build around that concept. You may like to use the MToF Eladrin statblock as is or you can use them as a strong foundation. 

For the rest of the court, take the NPC statblock in the MM and apply any relevant Eladrin/Sprite/Pixie templates to them. The head of the court's guard can be represented by the Knight statblock, the court wizard can be represented by the Mage statblock and the Guard/Scout statblock cam represent other soldiers. Of course, you may want to modify their features/traits/equipment as you see fit."

7,"It isn't their job to be well-versed in planar lore. That's why they can learn more about that in the world, which is your job."
7,"A PC can easily know how many hitpoints they have based on how wounded or weary they are. They could similarly know how many spell slots they have based on how mentally drained they feel. Both can easily be communicated to other PCs too.

""Level"" is an entirely different sort of abstract, imo. Sure experience can be quantified, but it can also only be relative. One fighter may know that they are a more experienced warrior than a town guard but less experienced than a legendary knight, but would they be able to translate that relative scale into ""level""? This line of thinking is reflected in the Battlemaster feature ""know your enemy"", which can only be used to identify a target creature's fighter levels or total levels relative to the Battlemaster and not absolutely.

Wishing for peak fitness, peak knowledge, etc. will likely incur some tragic unforeseen consequences, as outlined by Wish being more likely to fail based on how great the wish is."
7,"Perhaps the journal has a dead end, but points towards the PC's father's planned expedition to a specific plane. I imagine some drama would spawn from the PC realising their father has embarked on a poorly-planned expedition to Acheron or the like."
7,"Give it a shot, absolutely! At the very least, you'll learn a lot from improvisation of that degree that will help every game you run in the future."
7,"You can view DM styles as being on a spectrum.

At one end you have the extreme railroad where player agency is nonexistent and the only content present is content the DM has prepared for the players to go through. Here the DM is overly strict and the players can feel like they're not getting a chance to play their characters how they want and they lose interest.

At the other end, you have the extreme sandbox where the story development is entirely player-driven and the DM improvises a lot almost to the point of exclusivity. A new problem is present here where the DM often produces something that is directionless or too ""random"" and the players lose interest.

Realistically, all DMs are somewhere between the two, and you'll find out for yourself which you're most comfortable with. Each DM will also shift slightly depending on the group and what the group enjoys playing. The players need the room to create a story that works around the framework the DM sets out.

In regards to an extreme sandbox, I have played in a game where the DM tried this and it didn't work well at all. It relies on an extremely creative DM that can adjust to any and every situation while still keeping the story flowing. In my experience, it was directionless and confusing and it all fizzled out after 3 sessions."
7,"Don't just make the magic items you award direct mechanical benefits all the time. You'll quickly find that your party's power creep starts shooting off and encounter builders and set-pieces will be much harder to plan.

Instead, treat your magic items like NPCs. That means asking yourself questions about them and answering them to produce a ""character"" for the item. What does it look like? Who made it? Who was it made for? What was its original purpose? What is the item made with? Where will the party find it, and how did it get there?

Here you have two situations:

Situation 1, the party find a Shield +1. That's cool, they identify it, the cleric dons the shield and off they go. Boring.

Situation 2, the party find a glistening shield bearing Helm's symbol. Despite being in a long-neglected tomb, the shield has not tarnished at all and is in better condition than most of the party's gear. One character asks if they know more and after a successful Intelligence (Religion) check it is revealed that this shield was once wielded by Ser Valus, a renowned warrior of Helm that was renowned for saving a local town from an arrival of demons. Another character identifies that the shield was forged by ancient dwarves in a far off stronghold and that its mithral gilding not only gives it excellent protection but also make it notably lighter than most other shields. But how did it get here? And what was the fate of Ser Valus? Much more exciting that way."
7,"Perhaps it literally is just research on the plant's growth. It could be that the development of the flower on other planes could similarly be applied to the development of mortals on certain planes?

For an Elf, that could mean researching how the plane an elf is brought up on affects them. The Shadar-Kai grow up in the Shadowfell, the Eladrin in the Feywild and the Sea Elves in the Plane of Water. What would happen if elves were to mature in Limbo or Bytopia?"
7,Bugbears first appeared in 1975's Greyhawk supplement alongside classic monsters like the Beholder.
7,"It falls under one of the things Wish explicitly leaves up to the DM.

In game, how would a PC know what something as abstract as level is? All they could do is wish to be more experienced, and that could have obvious side effects."
7,"Illusionist could still fit a ""god-challenging"" wizard. Perhaps they use their illusions to provide an allegory for mortals that the gods are constantly trying to trick them, and all they need to do is see through it?"
7,"I think Divination certainly makes the most sense, especially considering the parallels that can be drawn to theology, philosophy, and metaphysics in our own world."
7,"I think any Wizard can work best. What you're looking for falls under background, perhaps your wizard is a sage studying the metaphysical in order to better understand how the gods aren't relevant to mortal lives?

If you are hellbent on defining this character through their Arcane Tradition, perhaps Divination suits best? Perhaps their predictions about reality come from very accurate mathematical or astrological models, compared to the seances of clerics or the omens of druids."
7,That's ignoring one very important detail. That payment is just for proving the lord that you did slay the dragon. Everyone knows that the real money in dragonslaying comes from looting their lairs and selling their organs.
7,"You're ranting here. 

You need to take a step back, chill out, and have a reasonable chat with your DM and the other players about the attitudes at the table."
7,"Strength saves often come up to avoid being knocked down, to resist being bound or to resist being forcefully moved.

Various beasts have the ""Pounce"" feature which forces a Strength Save or knocks the target creature down and the spells Entangle and Gust of Wind also force Strength Saves."
7,"I think it is intentionally left up to the DM as it will depend on the visibility of the terrain, as defined by weather, topography, foliage, etc.

7,"As the name implies, failing to stop the ritual in Rise of Tiamat can have some very negative repercussions.

Alternatively, make your own doomsday campaign."
7,"Cleric/Monk has some good synergy as you can build around a strong Dex/Wis just fine. 

Monk gives you good mobility and melee talents with some extra mobility/spellcasting from Shadow Monk.

Cleric gives you great support features, especially for healing and countering undead, while Grave Cleric makes you very useful for keeping your party alive and enhancing your party's damage.

They synergise really well and both fit in really well with the lore of the Raven Queen. If you haven't already, I highly recommend checking out the lore of the Shadar-Kai in MToF. You could even use Shadar-Kai as your player race option, the Dex and Con bonus being useful for such a multiclass."
7,"That's sort of where my thinking stems from too. Unless you're playing a system where superheroes exist (something akin to Daredevil or X-Men springs to mind), portraying disabilities as giving enhanced abilities just shows a total disregard for real disabled people.

That said, in systems like Mutants and Masterminds that have a built-in points system where maluses can be used to gain other strengths, it totally works there."
7,"The way to balance it is not being blind, to be honest. If you give PCs superpowers for disabilities, it sets a bad precedent and can come off as insensitive.

That said, the decision is yours as DM."
7,"Ask your DM.

If a player wanted to play a blind PC in my game, they'd have the blinded condition permanently until their sight was restored with Regenerate or some other similar spell.

Giving a blind PC blindsight plays to the very negative trope of ""disabilities are superpowers"", which I really don't like. Blindsight is also a very powerful sense that players would seldom ever have access to."
7,Have you talked to your DM about this? Asking a public forum will likely get you some very biased opinions that will not yield a healthy discussion with your DM in future.
7,"Perhaps their most elite soldiers have armour that is enchanted to let them cast Globe of Invulnerability on themselves once per day?

Wands of Detect Magic and Wands of Dispel Magic are also useful tools for going up against spellcasters of all ilks.

For mundane countermeasures, give them the ability to disarm opponents so they can remove spellcasting focii and manacles/gags to restrict somatic and verbal components respectively."
7,"Small correction, 500gp would be $25,000 per your calculations.

A range of $25,000-$45,000 is still quite broad, but I think it's still reasonable overall given the wide range of cost of living in our own world. That range is much more reasonable than your original estimate of $160,000"
7,"From the webpage we know that:

- The book includes both Hoard of the Dragon Queen and Rise of Tiamat

- It has a fancy new cover

- It includes errata and a reworked opening chapter

Anything else is speculation."
7,"It's on the image of The Great Wheel on PHB 303 along with the Positive Plane. They are also referenced in DMG 43.

You won't find much information on what it is like to visit there, as they're likely extremely hostile places for mortals that only need to exist to satisfy certain multiplanar metaphysical concepts.

The Negative Plane is detailed slightly in the Nightwalker's entry on MToF 216. The Negative Energy can be reach from the Shadowfell as the barrier there is thin. Such an act is described as ""tantamount to suicide"". If they aren't destroyed outright, entering the plane traps the mortal and unleashes a Nightwalker into the plane in their place. To return the lost PC, the Nightwalker must be lured back into the Negative Plane."
7,"It generally depends on the character and the context they are in. I can only provide examples from my current campaign.

Firstly, the rogue multiclassed into fighter after training/adventuring alongside the fighter in the party for some time.

The Monk multiclassed into Ranger after they spent a lot of time trekking the desert and trained how to slay dragons better. 

The fighter multiclassed into Paladin after following their devotion to Tempus and traveling to a Temple of Battle to swear an Oath of Conquest.

You can see why the books have no rules for these situations, but it is at least alluded to on PHB 163 in the green box."
7,"- Get the Elder Oblex to have Memory Drained the local lord or guard captain. They will have also used Detect Thoughts as much as possible to know everything there is to know about their victim.

- The Elder Oblex creeps through the sewers and pipes using its Amorphous trait and by casting Dimension Door to move around, aiming to get to the surface where its victim once was.

- The Oblex then poses as said character and tasks the party with finding a missing person in the sewers or busting an underground smuggling ring, etc.

- (Bonus points for having this take place somewhere that the smell of sulphur is overpowered or otherwise insignificant, e.g. strong-smelling flowers, an apothecary, or somewhere with gunpowder.)

- The party track signs through the sewers and near the Oblex's lair

- Inside, they see the unconscious, or at least weary, quest giver and the air around them grows cold and there is a faint smell of sulphur.

- To best use the Oblex, also make attempts to have the party separated so the Oblex can better dispatch them."
7,"Firstly, as you're dealing with homebrew, always ask your DM these questions.

To answer the question ""Can a dragon shapechanged as a humanoid use their breath weapon?"", the answer is no. Change Shape is very specific about what is kept and what is replaced. When a dragon uses Change Shape, their statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class abilities. The feature is very specific about what you retain between forms. That means no breath weapon in humanoid form and, most importantly, no gaining Druid class features when Changing Shape from dragon to dwarf. The latter is likely why you'll want to talk to your DM.

Unless the Dwarf has blindsight or an immunity to fire damage, both of those are lost too."
7,"FWIW, multiclassing into Fighter will not get you the heavy armour proficiency. You'll want the Heavily Armored feat instead.

For fighter dips, 2 or 3 levels is generally best. 2 gets you action surge (and second wind and a fighting style from fighter 1), while 3 gets you your archetype feature. As a Bard, you probably want to keep your spellcasting as effective as possible, and going 17/3 will mean you can still learn 9th level spells."
7,"In the case of such a boat, depth probably measures the hull without considering how tall either the mast or cabin are. Draft also measures the distance between the waterline and the base of the hull, a term you misused here. 

As for the entire post, you're definitely overthinking it."
8,"Almost all pro wrestling matches follow a specific formula: Babyface shine, heel tactic, beatdown, babyface comeback, finish.

For those not familiar with wrestling terms, a babyface is a good guy and a heel is a bad guy.

The match opens up with the two opponents on even footing. The babyface opens up with some flashy cool moves and it's clear that, out of the two of them, in a fair match, the babyface will win every time. That's why the heel has to resort to underhanded tactics--throwing them outside of the ring and into the barricades, doing moves onto exposed concrete, using weapons when the ref isn't looking, distracting manager, eye pokes, whatever. Occasionally you have a heel that is actually just so much bigger and stronker than the babyface that they don't even need to be truly underhanded, just outpower them by being fucking hueg. 

Now the babyface is in a vulnerable position. Now the heel can put pressure on them--a hold, beating them down, further outside of the ring torment, whatever. Any attempt by the babyface to gain ground is summarily threatened.

Then, by the power of the crowd's sympathy for the babyface, and his own burning spirit, his fire, his sheer force of will and his ability to simply *overcome the odds* he is able to turn the tide. The heel is on the ropes! The babyface is winning! The crowd is out of their seats!

Sometimes, depending on how long the match is going to be, and in order to control the response from the crowd, the heel cuts off the babyface comeback. The comeback wasn't enough so he gets back to the beatdown. The crowd is rooting *even more* for the babyface now, because his odds are increasingly stacked against him. But eventually the babyface is able to fight back again--whether by turning the tide from using a weapon the heel originally brought in, or having a friend come in to even the odds (perhaps the heel's faction ran in earlier in the match and has been interfering; now the babyface's old tag team partner has returned from injury and is able to drive them off!) or again, sheer force of fucking will, the comeback happens again and comes to a full burn.

Now the finish. If the babyface is going to win, he usually pulls off his finishing manuever and summarily defeats the heel. Depending on the pacing of the match and how many ""false finishes"" (moves or sequences where the crowd believes it to be over only for the heel to kick out at 2) they want, the heel might overpower himself out of the finishing move or counter it, or even kick out of it if the finisher is not protected well (some finishers are rarely kicked out of; others get kicked out of all the time so it's not a surprise when they don't finish the match). Then perhaps they are able to do their own finisher only for the babyface to kick out, or reverse the setup for that finisher into their own finish or a secondary finisher they have (many wrestlers have multiple finishes; for example AJ Styles has the Styles Clash, Phenomenal Forearm and Calf Crusher, a submission move). 

If the heel is supposed to win, perhaps they counter the babyface finish and defeat them with their own; perhaps they counter the finisher and then roll them up quickly with a pin combination and cheat by putting their feet on the ropes or using the babyface's tights for leverage. Maybe the heel faction storms the ring and beats down the babyface, ending in a disqualification. Lots of ways a wrestling match can end, depending on the future storyline.

How does this relate to D&D and 5e combat?

I structure my important encounters the same way. The first round or 2 is for the players to establish their grounding--a babyface shine. They fire off a cool ability or two thinking they're gonna end this quickly. This also allows me to establish what the monster's basic to-hit rolls and damage is gonna be like--""He hits with 18+7; you take *rolls* 16 damage."" Now they know what he is capable of, and start developing a strategy.

By the 2nd round I usually want to use the monster's special ability. Most monsters have something cool they can do, whether it's at will, 1x per day, etc. Sometimes it's just a spell, sometimes it's an ability like an Umber Hulk's Confusing Gaze feature, or a Death Knight's Hellfire Orb. This is beyond what the players were expecting and can basically be interpreted as a heel underhanded tactic--something they can do that the players cannot that unbalances the fight in the monsters' favour.

Now the beatdown happens. Mook monsters have their go at the players and, if possible, the big monster has its shot to attack a vulnerable player and mess up their day. Ideally by now, someone has hit death saves and the players are scrambling to get them back up, radically destroying their perfect plan!

The heat is on and the players are fucked. They're going to need to use something to turn the tide, whether it's a crazy magic item they've been saving, a big level 5 spell they only have 1 slot of, or simply effective use of action economy to rebalance the encounter by killing enough mooks that they'll mitigate all the damage and only have the big monster to worry about.

Now it's the comeback. The players get to do all their cool shit and pay back this bastard monster for casting Banishment on them or forcing them to attack their friends or whatever. The players are really excited because now they're seeing this monster get its ass kicked!

Depending on how long you want the combat to go on for--maybe this is a miniboss, maybe this is your BBEG and this is the final encounter of an arc or the whole campaign--you can cut them off. The monster has another ability, or a lair action happens, or they have a legendary action that they haven't busted out yet. They have another *interesting thing* to keep the fight evolving and changing, so that the players' plans keep having new problems pop up that they haven't accounted for, keeping them on the ropes and trying to figure out how they're going to get out of this.

It's important at this phase to not push them back so far that they can't recover. Things busted out at this phase should basically just be minor setbacks, complications--I don't like to set players into death saves in this phase.

Finally the players are having their comeback. Unfortunately D&D doesn't really have ""finisher moves"" so in some ways the ""finish"" of a fight can seem anticlimactic as a BBEG can die to a single well-timed sword strike, instead of a crit or a big flashy spell or something. This is actually fine if you let your players describe how they kill their prey after a huge fight, which I always do!

In a pro wrestling match, this is where the heel might cheat to win and get one over on the babyface, but chances for that to *actually happen* in a campaign are very rare. In most situations, you don't want the players to ""lose."" *Maybe* your BBEG is a spellcaster and he teleports or Dimension Doors away at the last minute, robbing your players of the satisfaction of killing him in order to fight another day--a perfectly viable heel tactic, Ric Flair would be proud. But 95% or more of the encounters your players will be in will be against monsters they intend to kill and that a summary victory for the players is desirable, so don't worry too much about the finish. Once the players have made their comeback, it should be obvious when the monster should die.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk. I hope this helps inform your combats and makes them more fun. Choose your monsters and encounters wisely for this, as a monster with too much or too little HP or too many abilities can wreck this horribly. I'd also appreciate any thoughts one might have about this."
8,"So you have an unwinnable encounter that the players are supposed to flee from or attempt to resolve without violence, but your players were foolhardy and started combat anyway. You're not sure if they're going to get your message but you're having a problem figuring out how to convey it without metagaming or telling the players, ""You're supposed to run, idiots!""

So they're 2 turns into this dragon fight and they're only level 2, they're going to fucking die. Ask at one point who has the highest Survival skill, or who is proficient, or both. When it's their turn, ask them to roll for Survival.

If they get more than a 5, tell them: ""Your instincts tell you that this situation is dire. If you keep trying to fight this dragon, you surely will all die.""

You've just told them the info, without metagaming, and given them the option to die stupidly. But asking for such and out of the ordinary check will hopefully get them to wise up."

8,"Count damage up. Don't subtract HP. It's faster and easier to add 12 and 6 than to subtract 12 from 37 and then 6 from whatever that was.

Ask for the players' AC, spell save DC and passive perception at the beginning of the game. This way you never need to ask a player ""Does a 13 hit?"" You know. Likewise for spells that require a saving throw. The player can just tell you ""I cast Thunderwave on these 2 guys; it's a con save and it does *rolls* 14 damage"" and you can just look and see what their save DC is while you roll. Saves everybody time.

Asking for this also gives you an opportunity to explain what these actually are to anybody who asks.

There are small comic, sci-fi, video game and anime conventions in every pissant town and city in America. The amount of crossover at these events is huge. Go there, meet people local to you that share interests, play with them.

Lastly, ask your existing friends. Sometimes you hit it off with someone new you work with--you both like the MCU movies and Evangelion. Ask that guy if he wants to start a D&D group.

This is a bad DM move.

First off, your answer whether he rolled a 4, a 14 or a 20 should have been negative, assuming there is no trap. Sometimes it's important to give the feeling that they could still be wrong, even with a high roll.

That said, giving any definitive answer like that...sucks. It destroys all tension  and drama.

If a roll is low like that, *do not give them definite information.* Do not give them a ""false positive."" **Never** tell a player that they ""do not see anything"" with a low traps or perception roll. Because that tells them what to think.

The proper response is, *""You aren't sure if it's trapped or not."" ""Maybe you see something? Maybe it's your imagination."" ""You aren't sure if he's telling the truth. There's no logical fallacy, everything checks out, but you can't get a read on him.""*

This way the player has to make a decision for themselves. It could still be trapped. He could be lying. Or maybe it's safe. Maybe he's telling the truth. You have to allow the player the ability to make up their own mind about this situation. All a roll gives them is insight, information, that their character might have that they cannot perceive, because they are at a table with paper and dice and not in a fantasy dungeon.

Even with a 20 they could decide it isn't worth it. You have to be prepared for that.

That said, if it bothers you, ask what their bonus is, and roll for them. I don't like this but it's your call."
8,"First off, to denigrate Yawning Portal as ""just dungeons"" is terrible. Players are meant to have their own goals. Like ""go get that talking sword from that mountain."" You aren't *supposed* to run it like a campaign, you're supposed to hack it up and use it for parts in your ongoing game, whether that's homebrew or a module. The Doomvault can always exist, you just need a reason to go there.

That said, Saltmarsh is more than ""just a bunch of dungeons."" The adventures in it are slightly more varied in locale, and there is an *entire* chapter on the town of Saltmarsh and it's politics, NPCs and factions that the original modules left for the DM to make up. Isle of the Abbey has a great, unique beach encounter. The Styes is basically a Call of Cthulu adventure in D&D, with lots of social interaction and investigation. Salvage Operation is a shipwreck.

The encounter stuff in the back is *fantastic* and you could literally pull it out and put it in any campaign where there is a boat sequence. Random encounters, 4e style maps for all of them, and the same area even has a couple different tiers of options so they are usable at any point in a campaign. 

There is also advice on how to tie together not just GoS but also Yawning Portal, for those who were upset at that book's supposed lack of story."
8,"I tend to run with new players for mostly this reason.

8,"Yeah, except I also use that as a CYA when I do mess up. I'm not about to fuck up the verisimilitude of my world for that, and you're not going to die in my campaign unless *you* fuck up bad."

I use whiteboard grid tiles for combat. If anyone has a problem with perceived ""lack of detail,"" they are free to run their own game and take over.

These methods also allow me to improvise anything that might happen. If the players ask, ""Is there a bookcase?"" and the layout shows no bookcase, then there's an incongeuency that sucks. But if the map isn't very detailed, or the room is just a grid, then *anything* can be in there."

Action economy.

A ""balanced,"" medium difficulty fight usually has the bad guys able to do as many actions as the party can in a regular round. I assume they were at level 1, which ALL classes are squishy at. 

If there are 4 players, then there should be 4 enemies who can make one attack per round. Thats it. If you always remember that as your baseline, encounter design is *easy.*

As you level up, monsters get multiattack which lets them make 2 attacks. This keeps them on par with players who get 2nd attack and 5th level cantrips doing 2x damage.

You CAN overwhelm a party with action economy and have them still win, but they need to be higher level and have some crazy resources, like 2nd and 3rd level spells or magic items."
8,">i rarely ever run that spell BECAUSE it prevents people who wanted to be caster to do what they want 

Yes! No shit!

That's called a challenge!

Yeah sometimes in a fight, the enemies go ""Absolutely fuck *that one guy in particular,*"" and remove them from the fight. 

The fighter sometimes gets Hold Person cast on him. The wizard ends up in the antimagic field. The paladin gets Banished so his aura no longer helps allies.

Ravnica is a MTG campaign world. I don't know what year it takes place in and I don't know why it would matter.

Ghosts of Saltmarsh marks the return of our blessed Greyhawk. I don't have my copy with me right now so I can't look and see if it gives a specific year, *but,* an indication from Mike Mearls in an interview he did on the NewbieDM podcast is like--okay.

So the original Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh does not provide you with a town. It tells you there *is* a town and tells you what you need to make for it, but does not provide this. In the 3e era, someone (Mearls himself?) updated the module and included a town, *but* it was in line with the anniversary ""Return to Keep on the Borderlands"" etc series of modules. So this is the Saltmarsh of 30 years after The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh. Mearls said in that interview that he started with *that* town and then sort of reverse engineered what it would be 30 years ago for Ghosts of Saltmarsh.

So if GoS doesn't provide a year, try to find that 3e version and subtract 20-30 years."

Maybe weapons get a small overhaul--a mace becomes 1d8 instead of 1d6 for example. Maybe some spells change or get removed and made class features like Eldritch Blast. Maybe monsters change--instead of spellcasters having spell slots and stuff they just get unique spell like abilities. Maybe two weapon fighting gets revised. Maybe the Ranger is radically different.

Source...?"
8,"A D&D oni is not a Japanese oni. 

If you try to run a D&D Gorgon as a Greek Gorgon you're gonna get real fuckin confused.

Gygax and Tim Kask and everybody pulled a bunch of spooky names from every source they could find in the 70s, often with vague or barely any context.

A wight, a wraith, a ghost--in the real world these are all synonyms. In D&D they are specific things. 

You can mitigate this in two ways:

1) Stop using monster names. Like, altogether. Instead of saying ""it's an oni,"" just describe what it is. 

2) If you say it's an oni and someone brings up a real world context thing, simply say ""How would your character know that?"" or ""That may be true here on Earth, but in [your world name] it's different.""

>  Is this a form of appropriation? 

Maybe! If it makes you uncomfortable, change the names. Instead of an oni, it's a Gurthagon."

8,"Which subclass are you? What are your friends playing as? I'm going to assume you are a standard party of 4. 

Make sure you are effectively using your Bardic Inspiration. I think at your level you should have at least +4 Charisma which gives you 4 uses per short rest. If you guys tend to do only 1 or 2 big fights in a day, you can go ""nova"" with your Bardic Inspo and give your party members a d8 to add to any d20 roll, and those recharge after just chilling out for an hour (which your fighter friends will want to do anyway).  It only costs your bonus action so in 3 rounds all 3 of your allies will have had a dice.

If you are a Swords or Valour Bard you get 2nd attack which will keep you fairly competitive in weapon damage, especially if you're smart and have high Dex and use finesse weapons (rapier, shortsword, and I think Scimitar are the best options). 

If you're a Lore Bard you can use Cutting Words to basically burn a Bardic Inspo dice to take a d8 off of any monster who hits your allies. Save this for your friends with the shittiest AC. I think it also works on damage, so if someone is like ""Hey I only have 4 hp left, I might die,"" you can use Cutting Words to stop the damage from happening up to a d8. 

If you are a Lore Bard you get your first Magical Secrets next level. Try to identify a hole in your group's spell lists and take that. For example if there's no Wizard or Sorcerer, take Fireball, it does 8d6 of damage and is crazy good. Counterspell is also the shit, if no one else can take it, but even then you might be better at them because Jack of All Trades could give you a higher bonus for your Arcana check, if needed.

As far as spells go: you are level 5 so if you still can, remember that you can swap out a low level spell for a level 3 one along with picking up a new, presumably level 3 spell. You don't have to do this but it helps, as some spells get worse as they go on or you need them less--if you have a 5th level cleric with you you don't necessarily need to carry around Cure Wounds. 

Speaking of, don't top people off with HP. Wait until they hit death saves, bring them back up, and then worry about what to do next."

If you want the mechanical benefits of a Cleric, as a Warlock, it isn't that hard to justify in story why your Warlock suddenly has more spell slots and spells. Warlock/Cleric is actually one of the easiest RP multiclasses besides Paladin/Cleric.

Also, you assume every game takes place in the same timeframe as yours does. Perhaps between levels 6 and 7 there is a 5 year time skip. More than enough time to become a level 1 monk or convert to a new religion or go back to school and learn how to spellcast."

This is fine. Also consider halflings as they are a ""common"" race in the PHB and one of the original D&D races (alongside half orcs but that's irrelevant).

If someone wants to be a gnome, tiefling or dragonborn, explain they would have to be the first or one of the first and develop that races' role in the world with them.

> And also classes and subclasses which would stay and which will not? I was thinking that since this is still a young world would some of the subclasses not be invented yet?

Don't do this, it's dumb. Classes and subclasses are game mechanics, not necessarily things in the world.

That said, if you are looking for a lower magic style game for your classes, check out 5e's Adventures in Middle Earth. It has some full non-magic classes that are ripe for the picking. Failing that, you might want to actually just run this in an OSR system."

That's how it should go. You don't need to know that elves get advantage vs charmed, the player does.

Know how movement works, difficult terrain, know when to call for saving throws. Know that 20s aren't auto success except on attack rolls.

I don't think it wasn't until Gencon 2 that Dave Arneson met Gygax and took his Chainmail rules for hand to hand combat and fantasy supplement with him. Or something like that. I can't remember the exact timeline.

The earliest gencons or other cons with actual D&D games were likely run in Blackmoor or Greyhawk. 

In those days it was assumed every DM had their own world that centered around a megadungeon that they designed. Anyone playing at a con would likely be playing in that DM's world.

By 1975 the Tomb of Horrors existed and those who attended Origins I could buy one of the original printings, with different artwork than the published module.

8,"I recently did something like this. Players spent levels 1-3 in small towns, wilderness, dungeons, doing regular D&D stuff. At level 4 they got to a major city where in 4/5s of the city, even carrying weapons is illegal, and they also aren't allowed to cast spells openly.

This has 2 provisos: First off, it is possible to get ""knighted"" and carry weapons, and get a seal from a magic guild in order to cast spells. So a long term goal is to be able to carry and cast wherever. The other thing is, the players could eventually decide, you know what, fuck this whole *city,* we're going back to the wilderness and doing something else.

Outlawing magic in the whole *world* would be difficult. Who even polices it? Do they have the budget to have magic detector guys at every shithole town on the coast? 

Consider this outlawing to be just within this kingdom/province or, fuck it, even this continent. And consider having a long term goal of ""let me cast openly.""

Decide how much this is realistic to be enforced. If they cast Prestidigitation in the shady as fuck criminal tavern, are all the criminals going to freak out and call the cops? Probably not.

Is there an underground resistance or coalition of magic users who want to take down the oppressive government? A competing, at war kingdom who wants to liberate the magic users? A powerful mage from another dimension who has ended up trapped here, unable to plane shift out due to lack of materials?

They're different skill sets. As a player you can kinda just show up on the day and play, and when it's over you move on with your life. With DMing there is *always* more to do. Building far off areas, figuring out what adventures will happen later, researching, buying and painting minis, drawing maps, creating new subclasses or races, etc. If this is your thing you might never stop thinking about it.

As far as at the table, you have to drive everything. As a player it is very easy to sit back for 10-15 minutes and say ""My character doesn't care about what's going on so I'll just hang back."" It is extremely hard to find those moments as a DM. When my players start debating a plan it's *great* because you finally can just ignore everyone for a second and get out of your own head. But, I am a weird extro/introvert who needs to recharge after I interact. I love being the center of attention at events (I play in a band too) so I am fine with basically performing for several hours. I like finding out what will be dramatic and exciting or devastating for my players and using that against them. 

I also love having to improv. I hate boxed text and I prepare less and less these days. The session I ran last week had maybe a paragraph's worth of notes besides stuff like monster stats and spells. I like giving a vague description, seeing what they ask about, and expanding on that. I like having to hold information about a location in my head for like a week and then I never have to think about it again. And after the game, there's always another one next week, I don't have to go out and try to book gigs or write new songs, there's a forward momentum that makes it easy.

There are also plenty of free adventures both official and unofficial that can get you started if you aren't comfortable with homebrew, and Kobold Fight Club will help with your encounter balance at first.

But, I almost never need to look anything up at the table anymore. I have such a good grasp on 5e's rule design that I can guess what a rule is, and if I look it up, I was right.

8,">Can the Fighter have the same kind of advantage when it comes to maxed strength and proficiency? What about our spellcasters? Do they also have as significant as an advantage compared to a rogue and their double proficiency bonus? 

In their own ways. Not usually with skill checks, no. Because those classes don't tend to focus on being skill monkeys the way rogues (the original skill class) and bards (in 1e required 3-5 levels of thief) do. But they do get their own features that make them better at what *they* do.

For one thing Barbarians get to have I think 22 or 24 strength at level 20, and their rage damage tops out at I think +4. That's a pretty significant boost, giving you up to +13 to hit. Fighters' fighting styles get to add all sorts of floating modifiers. Spellcasters already have *huge* amounts of power since they're spellcasters, they can literally stop time or just *wish* that they had Expertise in stealth. 

But you're right, we probably aren't going to agree. I think it's fine as is, and most seem to agree. This honestly changes so little that it's insignificant."

8,"Do you like this person and hang out with them regularly?

I have a pretty simple policy: I will play a game with *anyone,* **once.** Invite them in as a one off, to see if they ""fit the group."" Do not tell them they are in. Your group is very important and you have a good thing going, but your playstyles might not fit--maybe he wants to be evil and you run a good campaign or maybe he finds out he loves combat and you have entire sessions without it. 

Explaining this up front gives you an out. It's not your stutter, you just came in and tried to murder a shopkeeper--that isn't how we play and we don't want to play with someone who does that. It also helps alleviate things by it being the entire group that's uncomfortable, not just you.

This is assuming you can't be an adult about it and tell them upfront.

Even in this case, I would be honest with them *and* give it one shot anyway. You might find that they can pull their shit together for a few hours, or that it isn't as bad as you hoped, or that he actually is really fun and creative enough that you can get past it. 

I recently watched a (pretty awful IMO) documentary about Blackmoor, Dave Arneson's fantasy game that became D&D. And the guy who took over for Arneson as DM after his death, he has a huge weird birthmark all over one side of his face. I mean he literally looks like he could be a James Bond villain or something. I initially was like, ""I don't know if I could play in a game with him without it being distracting."" But by the end of the documentary I had actually gotten over it and forgot about it.

Play *a* game with him and see how it goes. Maybe you find that he isn't a fit for the group but you could start a smaller splinter group with him that plays less often."
8,"Just have her goals no longer align with the party. ""Oh you're going to Dawnharbour? I'm going to stay in Fallcrest.""

That said, just tell your DM you don't like this character anymore and want to switch out. If any of my players said this to me, I'd let them change out easily however they would like. Ideally that character just leaves or retires, but sometimes a death can work too. They may even relish in the opportunity to kill a PC scott free!"

8,"Look into a College of Valour or College of Swords Bard as well. Those could definitely be piratey, with all the flourishy swordplay."
8,This is why I give a free feat at level 4.
8,"I use a similar one and make every player take it. 16, 14, 12, 11, 10, 8.

Why this and not yours? Simple. Synergistic races allow for an 18 for the min-maxers (who could never guarantee rolling an 18 anyway and would just take point buy) whereas almost every player I've had has actually put their points so they get two 16s at level one.

I also tell everyone that they get a free feat at level 4, meaning they can almost guarantee an 18 in their main stat at level 4, something that the game basically expects if you do point buy or standard array. This way I at least keep CR a little in balance at the early levels, where it actually matters. The feat at level 4 means players have some time to develop their characters and see what they actually need, plus the game expects you to not have access to the classic GWM/PAM/SS at levels below 4. This keeps the early game power levels in check while allowing for the transition to tier 2 to feel really powerful. 

Also I make everyone roll for HP, but the minimum is half their hit dice--*not* the average, which is about 1 more, but literally half, so a d8 hit dice gains minimum 4HP/level. I just find it better, allows players to not get crippled while they still get to roll for HP."
8,"""Hey dude, I'm not having fun. I can't play in that store, and the sporadic attendence and haphazard storyline makes it hard for me to get into it. Good luck with your game.""

My group used to play at a pizza place. It started off okay but eventually there was a loud distracting TV, they would just let their kid run around asking us questions and annoying us all the time, and the owner ALWAYS wanted to talk politics (I routinely showed up earlier than some players who were always late--a different issue but whatever). I also feel like even though we never felt unwelcome I don't think anybody in the group ever called ahead on the day to let them know we'd be playing there, which if I had 6 people showing up to take up our only side room for 4 hours I'd kind of want advance notice. 

I basically had to say, ""I can't keep playing here, it sucks."" The DM understood and we all agreed to move to one of the other player's house. Suddenly the group became more cohesive and we got more done.

See if a change in environment and group cohesion will help him out. Offer your place (or wherever you usually run your game) if possible. Just because you aren't the DM doesn't mean you can't take some responsibility and offer up a space or help coordinate schedules (although if this is one of the things you find tedious about being the DM, then obviously don't do this). Ask if he needs help with these things so he can concentrate on making his game better."

8,"Insight is not Sense Motive.

Insight is your ability to put 2 and 2 together. It is your ability to use logic and see flaws or contradictions. 

My favourite use of insight ever:

Players attempted to infiltrate a secretly evil temple in the middle of the night, they got scared off by the guard dogs. The next morning they arrived during business hours and bluffed their way into the temple only to go off and explore at the earliest opportunity.

One player eventually found a room with sleeping guards and another door at the end of the room. He really wanted to know what was in that room but didn't want to risk a failed stealth roll and wake up the guards. I called for an insight check. It was like 13. 

""You haven't seen the dogs from last night anywhere. And these guys are sleeping during the daytime...?""

Player had all the information they needed to figure out what was in that room."
8,"DotMM.

Dragon Heist has its own problems, from being weirdly short and sparse to having a bunch of content you won't use because you're supposed to pick 1 villain from it and run them.

8,"Other games with lower magic already exist; most of them are D&D retroclones.

Some of these I agree with and some I don't. Some will *never* change because they're an inteistic part of D&D. Clerics will never *not* use Wisdom as their primary casting stat, because they've done so since before 1974. Bards will *always* be spellcasters.

It has possibly the best detailed town in any D&D module. It opens with exploration, intrigue and social interaction instead of ""you get attacked by goblins."" *It doesn't feature orcs and goblins,* making it very interesting even for a seasoned DM. It tells you what happens over time and lets you develop the plot. It has a cool dungeon with a neat map. It has optional locations (the temple, the bad guy inn). It holds *the fuck* up.

If I have any complaints it's that the NPC roster is a bit too male-centric and humano-centric, but I can't fault a 1981 module for that much, and swapping a few names, pronouns and racial descriptors is not hard. The overland travel section is a little rough and basically assumes you're playing in Greyhawk. I also think the gold values and treasure is a little too much for a 5e game but those are easily remedied. (For example, some of the townspeople have +1 swords, which in 5e is *ludicrous.*)

8,"Spoilers: They *do.*

A basic Martial character can attack for about 1d8 damage, maybe 1d10 or 1d12 if they're a fighter or barbarian and use heavy armour or no armour.

A spellcaster with a cantrip can do the same amount of damage with something like Firebolt.

Then, spells have spell slots, a limited resource, that allows them to do more damage, at the cost of being able to do so less times per day.

*Martial characters also have this.*

Action Surge lets you take an extra action during your turn but you can do it once per short rest. Barbarians have Rage which gives them extra damage. Paladins have Divine Smite which uses spell slots for an extra 1d8 of damage. Monks get Flurry of Blows and their variety of abilities which use Ki points. Battlemaster fighters get superiority dice which lets them use cool manuevers in battle but are limited in number.

They have abilities to do cool extra damage shit just like spellcasters, they're limited too by those resources.

If your DM doesn't like this, encourage him to run an OSR system or an old version of D&D with less character abilities."

Even without creating an account you can view the basic info and 1 subclass for *every* class on D&D Beyond. I would suggest going there instead of somewhere else because then you know the info will be accurate.

8,"> it's that this scenario is the worst thing that can happen, and it's just as likely to happen as a 10 being rolled, or a 20 being rolled, or a 5, or a 16. It's that they're all equally able to be rolled.

That's why modifiers exist though! That +11 modifier means that the ""worst"" they can do is the same as if they had rolled a 12 with no modifiers. Consider *that.* That means there is a *0%* chance they'll roll less than a 12, meaning if the DC is within the normal 1-20 range (anything exceeding DC20 is very rare) then their chances of a failure aren't equally probable. 

Let's say the DC is a 15. If he rolls a 1, he gets a 12, if he rolls a 2 he gets a 13 and so on. The maximum range of his rolls is between 12 and 31 here. There *is* still a 5% chance he will do ""the worst possible,"" of course, but in this specific DC15 example, there is only a *15%* chance of failure. Compare this to someone who has a 0 stealth modifier against a DC15, they have a *65%* chance of failure.

The modifiers skew the curve and make it easier to guarantee a higher roll. *Yes,* there is still a 15% chance of having ""the worst thing that can happen"" occur. That is why it is a *game* and not ""I just sneak past the guards with no difficulty.""

The game even has other mechanics to help mitigate this. +11 is the maximum for stealth at level 20 with proficiency and 20 Dex, *but* rogues get expertise which allows them to double their proficiency bonus, meaning you'd be up to +17 stealth if you chose Stealth as one of your expertise skills. You can have someone cast Pass Without Trace which gives you a +10 to your stealth modifier. You could have a magic item like Cloak of Elvenkind which grants disadvantage to everyone's perception checks to see you. I'm sure there's some boots in the DMG that help with perception checks or stealth rolls too. Or a magic item that grants you 22 or 24 Dex, similar to gauntlets of ogre power or something.

If I wanted my character to *never get spotted in stealth ever,* there are ways to basically guarantee that. Or any other skill check! You just need to keep it in mind and build around that or get magic items that can do that."
8,Revivify is a 5e spell that didn't exist in 1e or Basic
8,Hell no. D&D doesn't even appeal to the same tropes.
8,">It can make a super sneaky stealthy rogue regularly fail their stealth check because even if they have +11 of a modifier, they can roll any low number just as equally as any other number. 

If they have a +11, the minimum roll they can get is a 12. That isn't low. A commoner or guard with average stats of all 10s and no proficiency in Perception will have passive perception of 10 and a +0 if they roll an actual check."

8,"I don't usually find those moments hilarious. If they're jumping a pit trap and fail, that's a possible death sentence and leaving it to a dice roll is a pretty dumb idea."
8,"Here's my advice: Find and buy some of the 80s Warhammer RPG adventures. There's a very huge, extremely gruesome one called Death on the Reik that I'm sure has TONS of stuff you can mine.

It is already in the lore of the world so that part is done for you. The hardest part will be running it in 5e. You will unfortunately have to really understand 5e as a system to be able to take an adventure in another system and run it in D&D.

It isn't *as* hard as it seems, but running a 5e D&D adventure is usually pretty straightforward--""DC 15 investigation check to find the secret door."" In this case though, you'll have to ignore any kind of mechanical advice and rely purely on descriptions and objective numbers--for example ""The door is rusted shut but has a 15% chance of being opened"" translates to a rusted door with a DC 18 Athletics check. Its actually that simple.

The monsters are harder because Warhammer is not a D&D variant system the way, I dunno, Lamentations of the Flame Princess is, or a 1e adventure in 5e. Generally an orc is an orc and an owlbear is an owlbear in D&D, and *usually* you won't see a horrible game breaking imbalance between monster power levels in different editions. But Warhammer could make way different assumptions about orcs, or werewolves or vampires, or Giants, trolls, etc. This is going to involve 1 part researching D&D 5e and 1 part researching Warhammer lore--although as someone who wants to run a Warhammer campaign I assume you already kinda know your shit.

Good luck, it's easier than you think!"
8,"You're the DM, you can do anything. I recently had a god turn an owlbear into a figurine of wonderous power."
8,">Negotiating a shop keep's prices is hard to keep track of, especially when the players are all trying to barter.

Can't understand people who like this or allow it. I just have most shopkeeps say ""Prices are firm; if you think you can get it cheaper, feel free to buy elsewhere.""

On rare occasions where I think they've done good or insist they want to roll, I roll a d10 and tell them that's their % discount (roll a 2, 20% off). Then I make them do the math. Players are responsible for their own money and inventory. If they want to cheat that bad, fuck it, let them, I genuinely don't care.

> 5. I used 15 for ability checks way too much. In the future I will try and incorporate more difficulty classes.

Here's a tip: Stop setting DCs entirely. I did! 

To an outsider it probably seems like I just let certain checks go by, and in some ways, I kinda do. There are consequential checks and inconsequential ones. If it's an inconsequential check, if you even get like a 7 or 8 you will probably have a kind of partial success. You may not get the shop owner to give you a discount with an 8, *but* he might let you take a look at the *rare* goods he keeps in the back."

8,"I disagree with your assertion that Rangers weren't intended to be divine casters. They only got spells because Aragorn had healing magic. 

Of course, he had that because he was the True King of Men and not because he was a frickin Ranger, but Gandalf uses a sword so let's just ignore that."
8,"As a starter set it's okay. Obviously it has the ""can't create your own characters"" problem the normal starter set has. 

The adventure is laid out like it's written in a kid's notebook which unfortunately means everything is single column and in a faux-handwritten font. The plot is serviceable but since it's supposed to be written by kids, doesn't really have a lot of engaging or unique evocative ideas. Still, we get a handful of cool encounters and decent map geometry, you could run this as a one or two shot pretty easy."

All you have to do is describe to them the effects of the illusions, and when the inevitable reveal happens, you don't need to detail it--you can just say ""it's obvious that any physical pain you felt was caused by these elaborate devices and mechanics.""

But I'm super lazy."
8,No amount of begging me is going to make that work. **A creature is not a surface.** Spells do what they say they do.
8,"Here's the thing: 5e isn't a complicated game.

A monster is gonna have like 3 or 4 important bits of information: Its HP, AC, attacks, and special abilities.

Almost all special abilities are a matter of ""saving throw or take damage."" With that in mind, do you know offhand what saving throws even your most used spells are? How much does that matter in a game? If you know a monster's special ability is a Wis save, does that help you?

Or, in some cases, a monster has a similar ability to another monster. I can't tell you as a DM what the difference between a wraith, a shadow and a wight is. I know there's a life drain, Str drain and I think con drain in there? But that's not gonna help me as a player, and as a DM I *never* really say what the monsters *are.* It's a shadowy creature, that's it.

If your monster can be defeated by knowing what it is, it's a shitty monster. Even if they have the monster statblock in front of them, they still have to fight it."
8,"For me it is all tied to player progression.

Not character progression, *player* progression.

I throw consistently harder and harder enemies at them until they are basically fucked, and I watch them get better and better about using their resources.

When they start to chafe around *not having enough* resources, when they are finally almost always out of spell slots or always low on HP, that's when I let them level up. Then they get more health, more spells and spell slots, more abilities. Then I wait to see when they chafe against that too."

Hit dice and short rests are for this. Stop trying to break the game to kowtow around to a Final Fantasy game when there is already a game mechanic *literally designed* for this."

8,So you were around when AC wasn't a target number.
8,"Like any game system, in order to effectively create adventures, you need to be fluent in the genre that the game is portraying.

Standard D&D is a game where you go to dangerous places, fight monsters, and get treasure. Familiarising yourself with pulp genres and fantasy media will help generate ideas.

Players want to play a magical girl game? Looks like you need to start watching magical girl shows. 

The most obvious thing is to break it up into seasons or arcs and treat the first as an establishing monster-of-the-week genre. You can use Sailor Moon and the first couple episodes of Madoka Magica as inspiration, sure, but *any* high school Sentai (team) show with an episodic premise will work. There is, functionally, no difference between a Power Rangers plot and a magical girl plot. Any mecha show with an episodic arc can also help if the tone is right (Evangelion and Gundam are a little too ""realistic,"" you want something more bonkers and surreal that doesn't care so much about the ""rules"" of the real world). I think the first arcs of Bleach and Yu Yu Hakusho are great examples too. Even The Real Ghostbusters can work.

Most adventures should have a tract of some mundane real world problems that these teens are going to have to deal with. Intersocial issues, dating, homework, school extracurriculars, whatever. Then there is an obvious supernatural threat that appears. Early on, it's usually wise to somehow tie these two together if you can--for example, the girls go shopping at a new store but then the owner turns out to be an energy vampire! 

As the campaign goes on you can abandon this pretense as it becomes obvious the girls are being targeted by the bad guys, who after repeated attempts are now dispensing with all subterfuge and doing shit like having a monster roll into the town square and demand he fight the girls, possibly with hostages."
8,"You should have been around when AC got better if it got lower.

To this day I don't think anyone knows why Dave Arneson used an armour system from a naval combat wargame other than maybe ""he already knew how it worked""

> All things being equal, AC starts at 10, so with no bonuses you have a 55% chance to hit (10 to 20). It seems like it should be 50%, and it would be if you had to beat the AC and roll an 11. 

This is true of every roll in the game.

Also, a negative Dex mod can make your AC lower than 10. See: Gelatinous Cube"
8,"I feel for you here; I am also a ""write down 3 things and figure it out later"" type of player. If we start at level 1 I'll have him worked out completely by level 3 or 4. Or as it comes up! Fuck it!

Explain that a lot of the fun for you as a player is figuring out who your guy is at the table. This is how you like to play the game. He plays in your game, right? Say that you don't hinder how he plays in your game; why force you to play a certain way in his?

As far as stats go, encourage him to let you use the standard array. Explain that they put it in the PHB for a reason: To let players use it if they don't find the other methods useful."
8,"Don't draw the entire map. Draw the room they're fighting in. Should not take more than a few seconds.

I put down maps printed on a single sheet of paper. I make no attempt to cover anything else."
8,"Yeah 500gp is a lot. The solution is to make monetary rewards almost insignificant, lower than 100gp. This way, the player is only doing stuff like playing in a bar or stealing from randos *because they like doing that.* The monetary rewards are secondary. They play in bars because they *like* playing in bars."
8,Tell that to my Barb tossing dwarf rangers
8,Not even as cool as fastball special
8,"The problem is that 500g is a not insignificant amount of money.

One thing is that my table, we wouldn't argue about this at all. We didn't do shit, and we have no kind of ""party fund"" or anything like that. As far as we're concerned, that's his money. What right do we have to get it?

I also, as a DM, am always careful with how I word gold rewards. I never say, ""You find 100 gold"" unless I intend for that singular player character to keep all 100. If it is meant to be gold for everyone, I would say ""You find enough gold for everyone to get 75gp.""

Bard performances rarely get more than 100gp which, in my game with a purely gold-centric economy, is not a lot of money. I don't have a rogue right now but if I did, if they wanted to pull off side shit on the reg, it would make about the same. Bonus money. Not income. Income comes from my planned adventures."
8,Pretty sure you can't drop anything outside of your turn.

8,"Your bosses are overpowered then, or your players don't understand how to budget their hit dice, or you suck at balancing encounters. Or, your fear that you might ""overpower"" them has led you to giving them dogshit for magic items, so you're trying to rely on CR or something instead of just putting cool, terrifying shit that can kill them in front of them.

But I keep giving them magic items with zero fear that they could get overpowered, because it just means I need to make the fights harder.

I also bullshit and improvise--a *lot.* You can see that right in my notes--""Animated Armour or Helmed Horror."" Depends on how hard the fights around it have been and how hard this encounter should be.

You're the DM, it's real easy to *not* TPK them. If you see they're already banged up, you just reduce the AC or spell save DC or HP. use less spells or abilities, or cut the mooks in half."
8,">“You continue down the corridor as you pass several rooms to your left about 10ft apart. Room 1 is just a barracks with some cots and shelves. Room 2 looks to be a kitchen with pots, pans, and a few greasy countertops. In room three you run into a squad of Kobolds polishing stalagmites to a shine. Roll initiative.”

Is this how your session goes, *verbatim?* Because I see two issues.

Issue one, you have *no* interactivity and you don't appear to pause for player interaction. Where are the doors, to provide choice and tension? 

Second, in that kitchen, *should be something interesting.* Unless the entire purpose of the room is to be empty for a breather (NEVER should a room 1 be an empty breather room) but there should be something, *anything* interesting in the room.

Stop designing dungeons like they're real places and start designing them like weird death traps. The players *will not* question why a dungeon has all this weird shit in it. It's a dungeon, that's why it has weird shit in it.

Instead they should walk into an entryway with a cluster of statues in the middle. *and then you stop.* You wait to see how they react to this information. Do they want to go near and investigate? Do they care what the statues are made of? Are they interested in other exits? *They* should ask these things, and then you provide. Do not just tell them, ""It looks like a kitchen,"" unless your intent is to say, ""This is an empty kitchen, move along."" 

There should always be at least one ""friendly"" NPC the players can talk to. A prisoner, a disgruntled soldier, a goblin who fears for his life when he stumbles upon the party taking a short rest. Just because it's a dungeon doesn't mean there needs to be all combat.

I also just toss the full map in front of my players. I make no attempts to obscure anything. A dungeon that can be defeated by knowing the layout is a shitty dungeon. 

Here are my literal notes for the 2 floors of a library dungeon I ran 2 weeks ago for some level 4s. (6, 6a and 6b are separate areas of a large open library; 7a is a closet)

> 1) Entry hall; plaque with history of library
> 2) Pressure plate activates animated armour or helmed horror + animated sword
> 3) Lookout to outside bridge
> 4) 1d6+1 Grimlocks (max 6)
> 5) Mundane supplies
> 6) Bookshelf mimic
> 6a) Gelatinous Cube (comes during mimic encounter)
> 6b) Bulette (comes when they find the document)
> 7) Rust Monster
> 7a) Treasure 
> 8) trash, refuse, decay
> 9) Windows to outside & hallway
> 10) 1d6 Grimlocks
> 11) Lookout, rare paintings of Dawnharbour nobles (500g)
> 12) Broom closet, hidden bottle of Elven wine
> 13) Chapel to Deep Sashelas, Elven sea God of knowledge
> 14) Guardroom - animated armour
> 15) Cells; skeletons inside
> 16) Bookshelves & records--document location
> 17) Locked archives; NPC--undead librarian sea elf: Horinth Glyndove aka ""Books""
> 18) Books' living space

As you can see there are a few completely mundane areas with no real interesting things but they are placed between encounters, and several of them do have interesting stuff like the hidden bottle of wine in the janitors closet. 

I don't describe how big the rooms are because the map does it for me, and helps make certain things obvious. And any of the mundane rooms will come after a very interesting area or can actually sometimes just *be ignored* by the players. If they go in the locked archives and speak to Books, maybe what he says to them or does can *infer* to them that the other room is his personal living space, so they don't feel the need to check that off a list.

Dungeons should be full of cool weird shit. If they aren't, put cool weird shit in them. Grab that monster you've always wanted to use. You don't *have* to explain how a Slaad got into this place, because the players, even if they ask, might not have a way of figuring out how that happened. And if they ask the NPC, he might not know either!"
8,"Probably fix that first if you have a big story you want to run, as opposed to semi-isolated one shots."

8,You're the DM. Give him 20 levels in wizard and another 16 in sorcerer. Now he has all the spells and enough slots to use them. Done.
8,">I'm creating a item for my campaign and on a critical hit it breaks bones. What kind of hit die is that?

Hit dice are not damage dice.

Why not just treat it as a vorpal sword does? On a crit they just get their bones broken and are effectively dead."
8,You could also do it as a flashback in that case!
8,"Oh man, all I can say is good frickin luck. Solo adventures in 5e are not easy to run and if the intent is for Strahd to pop up she could die real fast.

If I was you I would honestly do it at the table with everybody else and run a half hour to hour long focus on her as Strahd shows up and kills her father. He can show up with some mooks like imps or something reflavoured into chiropteran man-bat soldiers or something like that that she can kill but obviously she can't touch Strahd.

I recently ran a ""new player gets introduced to existing party"" one shot and nobody at the table was upset that the focus was on someone else as a solo adventure for the first part. Your players are presumably adults and understand the new player needs onboarded, and doing it *at* the table makes the other players invested as they literally see what Ireena is going through. If you haven't introduced Strahd yet it's also a great way to introduce him and his powers to the party as a whole in an environment where they can't start a fight with him."
8,">A new DM already has so much to think about, worrying about wether he is leveling PCs too fast or too slowly is not a necessary burden.

I mean, if you can't feel it out, you probably do need the help."
8,"Taunt I would uh, give a saving throw. Probably base it on 8+Intimidation modifier or your passive Intimidation (which is higher) and make it Cha save. The HP I would just leave at +1"
8,"Yeah but Ritual Caster spells need to be ritual spells.

I dunno if this is the ""commonly accepted solution"" either, but it's one possible solution."
8,"Right off the bat, I hate pocket dimension bullshit so that's getting cut. Taunt has *no saving throw,* it's just ""free disadvantage x times per day"" which I don't like.

Edit: Superior HP or whatever it's called gets ridiculous at level 13. Imagine this guy multiclassed with a bear totem Barb and he's the dwarf who gets extra HP. He would be next to impossible to kill."

8,Just play at level 20.
8,"Yes, why wouldn't you? You can use greatswords, mauls and greataxes and since you don't need Dex you can get full plate and just always have 18 AC.

9,"Hello, everyone!

I'd like to take a moment to advertise our year-long project, finally completed: [the **Artifacts of the Guild**](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/272859/Artifacts-of-the-Guild)!

This beefy 88 page book (that will also be available for on-demand printing) is full of top of the line, properly balanced and playtested magical items to fit into any D&D game. It has flavorful common magic items to spice up your setting, great uncommon, rare and very rare items for interesting gameplay changes, as well as several pieces of legendary gear that would make for a great campaign arc.

We offer:

- ***10*** powerful **artifacts**, including the Blades of the Archrogue, the Sanguine Shield, and the Staff of Tiamat
- ***30*** **legendary** items (ever wanted a deployable tower full of guards?)
- More than ***50*** **very rare** items
- More than ***70*** **rare** items
- Plus almost ***100*** more **common and uncommon** items.

It has art. It has content. It's made by a huge compilation of bright creators. It's already a Gold Seller on DMsGuild! Please, consider checking out our hard work!

Thank you."
9,"When I was playing around with the ""This is your life"" rules, I've rolled up a fact that my 48 year old Rogue's wife is a 40 year old ""**Chaotic Evil farmer**"".

At first I didn't really think much of it, but when I got to the point of character creation, where I should write out my character's spouse, I got a bit puzzled. *What would a Chaotic Evil farmer be like?*

Now you could say that she's just a dick to the neighbors and envious of their success, but that is more of a descriptor for Neutral Evil rather than full-on ***chaotic*** evil.

Plus, farming is hard laborious work that needs to be repeated daily, so it's hard to imagine a chaotic person having a farm in the first place.

Thoughts?

EDIT: Bonus points for giving a reason why an old Folk Hero Rogue would settle down with someone like a ""chaotic evil farmer lady""."
9,You're allowed to do that. Look into SRD and Open Gaming License laws to learn more.
9,"> Most likely will move it to level 6, or simply add full proficiency in death saves and be done with it!

Sounds like a good change, for sure.

>In terms of free metamagic, the only options that are free for sorcerer necromancy spells are a twinned false life or ray of sickness (intended, especially if they are only cast at 1st level), or using Distant Spell, Careful Spell, Subtle Spell, or Extended Spell, all of which are decent mechanical bonuses but I don’t see them breaking anything with the options available (10 necromancy spells available for sorcerers at all).

- Free Empowered blight?
- Free Empowered Finger of Death?
- Free Empowered Circle of Death?
- Twice cheaper quickened Enervation?
- Free Subtle Blindness?
- Always Empowered d10 Chill Touch?

*And that's just a small bit of it.* You know what makes it really bullshit strong? **The fact that you get an Empowered Quickened spell for 1 sorcery point**.

So you can cast an Empowered (1-1=0 sorcery points) Quickened (2-1=1 sorcery point) Blight into an Empowered Chill Touch. This applies to any other Empowered x [Metamagic] combo.

*What costs 3 sorcery points for every other sorcerer costs only 1 point to this one.*

Your damage output **easily** outperforms any other sorcerer at mid to high levels over the course of the day. Your efficiency is insanely good. 

It's a huge power boost that suddenly turns you into the most destructive force on the battlefield. 

>I wanted sort of a World War Z vibe out of that last one, a group of undead sees you as their own, or as something totally non threatening by default, so they dont go after you.

1) This is basically the best sorcerer for multiclassing. Half proficiency bonus to all saves? Hell yeah, bro!

2) Free metamagic should not be a thing, especially not to a school as powerful as Necromancy.

3) Having undead be non-hostile is... weird. Undead aren't celestials. There are many reasons why undead would be hostile to you by default.

9,"Depends. As a straight up paladin? Usually no, that's as high as it will go without magical items. You can get more with a +3 shield and +3 armor. You can also get more if you pick up the Magic Initiate feat to get the Shield spell. That gives you another +5 AC until the beginning of your next turn.

9,">Is there any tips that I can be given, ways to play, resources, advice? 

Play the adventure from the set you have. It's got a lot of tips for newbie GMs on how to run the game. It's a bit generic, but that's a good thing, in your party's case.

Other random tips:

- Don't have more than 4 players, or 5 if you're being ballsy. If you have more than that - split and run two separate games.
- Quiet background music goes a long way to fill in awkward pauses as everyone processes the action. Find some long compilations on YouTube.
- If you have less than 4 players - be more liberal with healing potions and magical items.

>And is it possible to DM and a play a character? Really want to make a bard or warlock :)

In theory? Yes. It's called having a DMPC. However, after years of playing D&D **I haven't seen even a single good DMPC**.

Due to your meta knowledge of what is happening in the adventure:

- Your DMPC might be the star of the show with powers of foresight.
- Your DM might be a dumb mute, who just kinda follows around, which is unrealistic and boring.

Again, if you're feeling very confident in split roleplaying - go right ahead. Nobody will stop ya."

I will say this, though 

>Graz'zt 

Graz'zt is a demented murderer and a violent killing machine. 

Saying that Zelatar is a peaceful place is insanely wrong, and you'd know it if you read the Fiendish Codex. He ran the place with a protection racket. Gave merchants protection, while often breaking it himself. The city is filled with chaotic evil creatures as well.

9,Yes
9,"
>Those are blurbs, confirmed by JC, MM and CP. All of them.

All of them have also changed their mind on other aspects of the rulebook previously and have also said that their twitter posts are ""just one intepretation"".

>So what? So would a different character which is good, a different neutral character, a different evil character. The only constraints there are how important the goals are and how constraining the morals are, and *neither of those have anything to do with alignment*.

Morals are a principle of what's right and what's wrong. Unless you specifically have twisted morals (OP never specified that) - morals have *everything* to do with the alignment. 

What can argument could you possibly make to argue otherwise?

>For evil reasons. Did you forget that part? Deeds don't matter, motives do.

Motives can change on a limb. So, **by your definition**, if an evil character is caught in the act by a Paladin of Tyr, and has a longsword put to their throat and **legitimatelly** doesn't want to die and would rather not commit evil **in that moment** to survive - *his alignment momentarily becomes Lawful Good*?

I mean hey, his motives *genuinely* changed, right?

>Quite the opposite in fact, that sounds 100% chaotic. Chaotic characters believe in the individual's capacity of choice, in the individual's freedom from stifling things such as laws, expectations, traditions or hierarchy. 

Sure? Can you stop trying to finesse out of the question? We're not talking about the Chaotic part. We're talking abiut the Evil part.

>Oh yes of course, take one individual unique single character ;) and all others must be the same.

My guy is the epitome of a crazy Wizard. I agree, it's just one example. Yet can you provide me a single - **a single** - example of a pre-written NPC from any non TSR edition that was Chaotic Evil yet still comitted such good actions as resurrecting wrongly killed people, preferred fair discourse and peaceful solutions over arbitrary violence?

Looking forward to seeing how you'll be finessing out of this one.

>Let's not. Let's instead use the correct one.

The book shows the correct rules. What the designers say outside of the book is not relevant, by their definition. That's why they push the line on the PHB ranger never being changed."
9,Interesting. Thanks for sharing. How was the performance?
9,"I don't care what the project head says. We have a **rulebook** that says what the rules on alignments are. Also, the timestamp you linked agrees with *my* take on it. More on it below.

Let's read what is Chaotic Evil: (might interest /u/secretrider, too)

""*Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust*"".

OP clearly described that his character:

- ***Has morals.*** This alone makes it a tentatively neutral, because an Evil character wouldn't mind abandoning his or her morals to achieve their goals.
- **Goes out of his way** to commit good deeds, which is not something that a tyrant or any evil creature would do, because, well, going out of your way to do anything is not necessary. That's why it's called ""getting out of one's way"".
- Resurrects a wrongly killef creature **for the sole purpose of letting it live free**. Absolutely no Chaotic Evil character would **ever** do that, unless it directly helped them. Take Halaster Blackcloak (DOTMM spoilers within). >!Sure, he allows a Druid to live within his dungeon. Not only that, but he used Wish - one of the most powerful spells in creation - to give her a home reminiscent of her true home. However, as a chaotic Evil creature, he only does this to populate his dungeon and challenge those that tread his halls!<

So let's review, comparing to the PHB's definition of alignments:

- His character **doesn't** act with arbitrary violence. On the contrary, his character takes ""peaceful"" approaches and ""goes out of their way to commit good deeds"".
- His character **isn't** spurred by greed, hatred or bloodlust as they go out of their way to resurrect a creature they thought should live, purely to let it be free.

***Hence, his character isn't Chaotic Evil***.

As described, seems Chaotic Neutral at best and True Neutral at worst."
9,"The GM decides the extent of this ability.

Personally I allow this to change the shape of the illusion, but not its powers, since it'd get too confusing."
9,"Edited the comment. And yes, I do. Do you? He only fought defenseless women. He's physically strong, but I do not believe he ever showed off his skills with the blade as anything approaching particular proficiency.

He's also not a tracker, nor particularly focused on fighting or combat."
9,"Seems like an average Noble statblock to me. He only wins by surprise and subterfuge, so I'd guess that, if anything, he's a level 1 Rogue. Explains expertise in intimidation, too."

9,"PHB. That's pretty much it in most cases.

9,"By far my favorite cantrip I've ever read was the ""Capture"" cantrip. 

You can google to find its source, for sure, but the premise is that it's a cantrip that lets you take magical photos. You put your hands the right way and as an action take a mental image. You can then take a minute to imprint the mental image on a surface.

In other words, either he's evil and the others are also either evil or neutral.

Or he's neutral and is simply funny in the head, as he wants to be feared, yet is still generally pleasant about things.

Also, **being feared doesn't make you evil.** A Lawful Neutral cleric of a deity of Justice (like Amaunator) is 100% a creature to be feared, for their justice is swift and punishment is remorseless. However, since they do not commit evil acts exclusively - they're neutral."

Then you write the ending, a few pointers on how the adventure may be continued if the GM wishes to continue.

9,"It's called Play By Post.

1) Download Discord

2) Create a server

3) Invite Avrae Bot and Sidekick Bot to the server and learn their commands

4) Go to MythWeavers and make online sheets.

5) Create one ""*#general*"" chatroom for banter.

6) Create one ""*#game_name_ooc*"" chatroom (OOC stands for Out of Character) for out of character stuff: discussing the game, further actions. 

6.5) Decide on how you prefer to roll. If you wish, you could create ""*#game_name_rolls*"" chatroom and leave it ONLY for rolling, or you could perform all rolls in the #game_name_ooc chat. I prefer the latter, because you actually know what is being rolled for. 

7) Create a ""*#game_name_ingame*"" chatroom. This is for all of the in-game descriptions. Character actions, DM narration, environment description, dialogues, monologues etc. Some rooms also ask players to add ""`rolled 19 Dexterity (Stealth)`"" after their post that required a skill check, but that's not required as it just adds a lot of busywork to the game, imo.

8) Decide on the typing format. My favorite is:

- Plain text for descriptions of actions and GM narration.
- ""**Bolded text for spoken dialogue**""
- ""*Italics for whispers*""
- ""__Underlined text for telepathic dialogue__""

And off you go. Enjoy your game!

A few notes:

- Short and deadly combat is preferred in pbp games, because doing lots of math is ass in these types of games. Not impossible, but can get tedious, if done often.
- **The less players you have - the better**. I can't stress this enough. Even having 4 players may be a total pain, as you all just wait for one guy to respond that they're okay with doing something. The absolute apex of pbp gameplay is 1 player 1 GM imo, but it can be done with even more people, if...
- **...everyone has stable mobile internet connection**. The ability to quickly shoot a post while you're on the toilet at work, or are bored during a lecture in uni is absolutely crucial at running a game where stuff actually happens. Otherwise pbps can take years to complete for an average length D&D module, for example."
9,"There's absolutely 0 smoothness added to the game if you let the players roll on checks that they can not possibly succeed. The very book suggests that you only roll when there's a chance of success and/or a chance of failure.

- You ***also*** **don't roll** if there's no chance of failure (surely you don't have your players roll Acrobatics checks for every step they take, because they could trip up, right?)"

20 x 10 what? 20 x 10 feet? Meters? Miles? Candies? Also, is it 20 tall? 20 wide? 20 deep? 

>appears from the shield

What shield? Is this item a shield itself that you have to don? Or is it an amulet that boosts an existing shield?

>that protects (?) everyone behind it.

**There are no facing rules in 5e**. The concept of what is ""Behind someone"" is very confusing, because the characters are omnidirectional in this version of D&D and all others, too, as far as I can remember. 

>The barrier is your Armor class + your Strength modifier

Okay, so if my Armor class is 22 and my Strength mod is 5, that means ""*The barrier is 27*"". What does that 27 mean? Is it HP that blocks incoming damage and the barrier turns off? Is it extra AC for everyone behind it? Confusing.

>well the barrier is active your movement is half

While the barrier is active your movement speed is halved*.

>The barrier well deactivates if you us a action or an attack gets through

Define ""gets through""?

9,">Robin Hood’s ethos was to rob from the rich only

As I've mentioned, if the ethos itself is still chaotic - then it's chaotic no matter how much you adhere to it. Refer to my example with the chaos cultists.

So while Robin Hood only steals from the rich, he's still a thief committing crimes that are favored by the Chaotic gods (i.e. Mask, the god of thieves) and hurting other people. As such his alignment would be either Chaotic or Neutral, depending on other factors within his actions."

The devourers likely have the highest odds of killing someone, if people actually used them in-game. However, they don't seem to be too popular despite the fact that 5 CR2 devourers can likely kill one character in a 4 person level 20 party.

Beholders are fun because of the disintegration ray. Killed a lot of players with it. 

Liches are the ultimate PC killers thanks to Power Word Kill. However, their exceptional lethality is somewhat reigned in by the fact that they are so high CR that many parties never get to fight them."

9,">Any general advice for a new DM?

***DO NOT*** run for 8 people. There, here's the best piece of advice you can get right now.

Split those groups in half and run the dungeon twice with each group. It's short, so it's not like it's a huge commitment.

Running for 8 players is total chaos. For one, nobody will feel special, because getting the spotlight amidst 7 other people is really hard. Someone will be left out. I'm not even talking about just generally keeping newbie players in check.

Another issue is that you're running a level 1 module. Increased number of enemies may mean a lot of dead PCs. And if the Monk dies, because he was swarmed by 4 enemies, then, well, salt will flow.

Finally, you're a newbie GM. Adjusting enemies will be hard for you and you will inevitably make mistakes. Which, hey, could be fine, but could also either lead to you totally slaughtering the party, or them slaughtering the opposition.

As an extra point, the dungeon is pretty small, if you are running it with battlemaps. Running it with 8 PCs and extra monsters might get a bit... Well, tight. Especially for mages who don't want to burn their friends."
9,"> This one actually looks good visually

TTS can be made to look good visually with some time, too, but yes, this does look better, visually. Which is both a blessing (more appealing) **and a curse** (creating textures for it will be more of a pain, if you want everything to be up to a similar standard).

Yet you didn't answer it, again? I'm not asking you what happens mechanically. I'm asking you what happens ***narratively***. You're the big pants GM. Narrate things.

>But your suspension of disbelief is not only justification for why one shouldn't allow for a Time Stop to function as 1d4+1 free actions.

Oh, it 100% is. But aside from the fact that **even you literally can't describe it narratively without attacking me personally** what happens when the time stops, it also doesn't make sense in the universe, and becomes way too good mechanically, as you can just smash someone with a bunch of anvils you take out of a pocket plane or whatever.

Which is why I'm saying that *even your solution isn't good*, there are better and more elegant solution.

For example, [the way 3e did Time Stop](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/3e_SRD:Time_Stop).

It turned all creatures invulnerable during timestop (as they should be!) and just allow you to delay all spells to then be cast once time continues, allowing you to buff the party, heal them up, and also blast the enemy, all in the course of a timestop.

A powerful spell both in utility in combat AND exceptionally interesting to the Bard class, specifically."
9,"Yes, but it's an entirely different ballgame. You can't take your time to carefully murder someone in real time, because, well, combat is going on and you need to quickly move your body. In timestop? You can take all the time you need, to perfectly line up your shot, pick the right angle etc.

>There’s nothing in the rules about insta-killing someone when they are defenceless

Not really. Improvised actions do exist, though. Nobody can say that there is a rule prohibiting an improvised action to be a coup de grace."
9,"So I guess your answer is really, ""I don't know""?"
9,"> There's always a chance to slip

So you have a problem with Timestop being too goofy to fail, but don't have a problem with your master wizard slipping up during stopped time? Lol. How ironic.

>With all the abstractions and fantasy elements of D&D brings, you really can't just accept the idea of attacks functioning (mostly) as normal during a Time Stop to make it a bit more powerful?

***You are avoiding the question***.

I repeat, the wizard player wants to insert a dagger into the Barbarian's eyes. How do you respond? ""*You slip and fall, instead only stabbing them in the arm*""?

>You can't auto-kill sleeping characters

The creature can wake up, roll around, a bird can fly through the door startling you, the attack you put at full strength to instantly murder someone enters at an awkward angle, leaving an ugly wound instead of a clean penetration, the target's skull turns out to be harder than you though etc.

A billion of reasons, **all of which wouldn't be applicable during stopped time**, where you can take as much time as you need to carefully murder someone."

9,"> That's an entirely different post and a complete derail

It's not a derail, since it's literally what this thread suggests would happen.

>there's no super special bonus that negates the abstractions of health points.

Why? ***ONLY YOU MOVE*** during timestop. Nobody else. Not even a muscle. Not even a little bit. Not even an inch. Not even an iota. Not even a teensy tiny bit. There's absolutely no way for them to defend themselves. They can't blink, can't cover their eyes, can't parry, can't hold you back... Nothing!

Time literally stops.

Why ***wouldn't*** you be able to autohit anyone?"
9,"> kanabo (maul stats)

Why would a kanabo ever use maul stats? Kanabo is the textbook example of a greatclub. Don't be afraid to sacrifice some damage to achieve better fluff. The GM will likely give you a +1 version of the weapon if he sees you trailing.

>Would you guys find this character fun or is he a little silly for advertising

Why wouldn't you be able to? They literally can't move. Level 20 fighters don't have more blood in their bodies. HP isn't blood points. It's basically a combination of stamina, defenses and luck.

9,"No, that's not what my question is, because I do not prefer Tabletop Sim.

>any DMs who scratch out the bit of the text in Time Stop that says ""you may not interact with living beings""?

That means that you can literally pierce the Fighter's lungs with a dagger and instantly kill anyone within the immediate area when you time stop.

So no, that's a dummy rule. The solution is to make this spell operate in the same fashion as it did in 3e.

While you're at it, also change Wish to work like it did in 3e. And also add Miracle to the game, because Druids are also full casters.

>A) Time Stop's relative lack of power compared to Wish ensures no one would ever take it.

Wish is objectively stronger than every other level 9 spell in the game. There's literally no reason to keep it as a 9th level spell, when it should be a 10th level spell in anything, but lore. 

Time stop does have a problem, but allowing you to instantly murder everyone in the area when you timestop isn't a good solution. A good solution is to delay attacks in some way. That'd be fine, yes.

Don't alter the gold given in the modules.

>I have two druids that constantly want to use survival skill checks

I'll stop you right there. In 5e, ***the GM*** decides when and what to roll, not the players (in terms of skill checks). The player can't say ""*I'm rolling persuasion to convince the king to give me his crown*"", roll a nat 20 and then look at you expectantly. 

The players say they search for food and resources. You decide if they can find anything, and if this would require a skill check or not.

>how do I handle these ""high reward"" requests properly?

You decide. You're the GM. You're 100% within your rights to say ""**You can't find any arcane herbs around to craft healing potions with**"" after they search for an hour. No need to make them roll, when there's no chance of success.

>I will attack with my sword.For my bonus action...can I hit them with my shield or kick them with my foot? Is that considered dual wielding?

Tell the players to read the dual-wielding rules. You can only use a bonus action to attack with a weapon in the other hand if ***both*** of your weapons have the Light property. Neither unarmed attacks nor shield are Light, so no, you can't strike with them as a bonus action.

If they multiclass into a Monk, they can then use their Flurry of Blows and Martial Arts features (if they're not wearing any armor, of course) to strike the enemy with their unarmed attacks as a bonus action.

If they pick up the Dual Wielder feat **you as the GM** can decide if you'd agree that the Shield can be used as an Improvised weapon, in which case yes, they can deliver a bash with a shield, which will NOT add their Proficiency bonus to the attack roll (unless they have the Tavern Brawler feat, too), deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage if they hit and NOT add their strength bonus to the damage dealt (unless they have the two weapon fighter Fighting Style from the Fighter or Ranger).

>How did you handle your druids shapechanging?

I assume the Druid knows every beast they can turn into. It's basically not a problem starting level 7, when the druids can just Polymorph one of their party members into every beast to ""see"" them.

>they can take it to an expert smith to be sharpened

How do you sharpen a Great Club? Or a Maul? Or a Club? Or a Quarterstaff? Or any non-bladed weapon?

>Now I feel they are trying to turn it into an OP skill to do after every fight.

So remove it? Or just keep answering ""No"" to all of your questions. It was a short-sighted mechanic and as a newbie GM you should always keep the ""*Subject to retcon*"" card for homebrew mechanics you add to the game.

This is why you don't homebrew as a newbie. You can't expect to break the rules well, until you know how the rules work in the first place."
9,"Ohh. That's simply the damage modifier.

The way damage works with, say, a greatsword is this. You look up the Damage Dice of the weapon in the book. For the greatsword - it's 2d6 slashing damage.

Then, you add your modifiers. Since it's a melee weapon, you add your Strength bonus to your damage.

With 18 Strength your modifier is +4.

So your full damage formula is 2d6 + 4 slashing damage."

>What would you do? What are appropriate consequences for his character?

Well, you have three options:

- Option 1: You just let him continue playing his character, except now with two extra scars. This is nothing special, he's an adventurer, after all. Being bloodied is nothing too special. This is a heroic fantasy game so you let the player roleplay his heroic fantasy.
- Option 2: You give him a debuff for it. Horrible scar comes in as an idea. Disadvantage on Persuasion & Advantage on Intimidation attempts against creatures who see him is also a decent idea.
- Option 2.5: You also make him infected and give him a disease, because of the fact that he didn't clean his wounds, though it would be very antiheroic to use such an option.

9,[Get good.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd2Sc-C0jhA)
9,"> I don’t agree that alignments are objective

The **only** system in which Alignment could work is an objective one. Here's an example of why you're wrong:

Talisman of Pure Good is a legendary item. It is a mighty symbol of goodness that can smite evil by totally destroying it. An evil creature that simply *touches* the talisman gets scorched for a whopping 8d6 radiant damage. 

So, by **your logic**, Hitler could easily wear this amulet and kill jews as he wished, because all villains think they're heroes. Hitler thought he was doing his country a favor by removing the awful evil people who are ruining it. 

That makes absolutely 0 sense and is dead wrong. Alignment works, because alignment is objective.

Another nail in the coffin of your argument are **alignments of the multiverse**. As the PHB states, some creatures can only exist within their given alignment. You can't be a Good-aligned Fiend. The moment a fiend stops being evil - they stop being a fiend, too. Same goes for Angels, such as Archangel Zariel, who went to war on Avernus, ended up being corrupted, lost her Lawful Good alignment and became a Lawful Evil **archfiend** instead. 

So even if you *think* the Fiend means good, or if the fiend things that what it does is ""good"" - it still remains Evil, because **alignment is objective**.

>Just look at the real world where laws in one country are different to laws in another. 

Firstly, Alignment has ***nothing*** to do with the laws of the countries. You can be a monk who grew up in total isolation in the middle of a desert, but you may still have a Lawful alignment, because you closely follow your dogma, even though you might not even understand the concept of law in a country.

Secondly, real world isn't D&D and **doesn't** have objective alignment. Well, unless you talk to religious people.

>I have a Dragonborn Paladin whose laws/customs differ from those of the humans in the party.

But either case, depending on what subclasses the Cleric/Warlock picked, you might be lacking a frontliner, in which case a Cavalier might be the best at optimizing the party. You also have higher STR, which means it'd be more efficient for you.

Battle Master is good if you want to kill things faster."

> a character with a strong personal moral code that does not align with laws be LN or CG?

We can only decide on the first letter (namely if they're Chaotic, Neutral or Lawful), because we do not know WHAT those moral codes are, so we can't tell if they're Good/Neutral/Evil.

If your character is really rigid in their way of thinking and their moral code isn't inherently chaotic - then they're Lawful. 

If your character believes that dogmas only weigh you down and are ready to do what must be done in any given situation - then they're Chaotic.

1) Don't play an orphan. And if you do want to play an orphan, make sure you have some NPC(s) you deeply care about and are invested into.

Simply put, the ""dead parents"" trope immediately turns your character less relatable for most people. You're an outsider, rootless, and don't have much investment in the world. If you add NPCs your character deeply cares about, it'll make them more rooted, more believable and your character will actually have a reason not to die and look forward to a safe return home.

Investment into your party member is cool, but there's not much there for the GM to work with, because, well, you're always together already. Additionally, having *too* close of a bind with one of the characters might make you two feels as if a part of your own group, with the other party members ""just tagging along"". That won't necessarily happen, but the risk is there.

2) **Explain your training**. You are a level 1 (or higher, whatever) adventurer. That means that you know ***A LOT*** of shit. You have skill proficiencies, armor proficiencies, weapon proficiencies, access to magic and cantrips which you got down so well that you can cast them without even breaking a sweat. *All of that needs explanation*. Describe your training, who trained you and how. What sort of lessons did that training teach you. You alone, even at level 1, can oppose several armed men and come out alive. Those are skills that need explanations.

3) **Give your character a reason to adventure**. This is another important one. *Why* are you diving into danger? *Why* are you a part of an adventuring party? Why aren't you trying to settle down somewhere and live a normal and safe life away from all the ruckus?

4) What sort of connection do you have to your patron? Does it demand something of you? Are you best buddies? Did you get your warlock powers after striking a deal? Did your patron just decide one day to mess with some mortal and experiment by giving a random nobody superpowers? Or did your patron simply reward you with a gift of magic for a thing you have done for it (perhaps unwittingly)?

For example, I once played a Celestial Warlock who, together with two of his brothers, defended a dying unicorn in the forest, attacked by undead. That unicorn knew that it will die either way, so it used the last of its energy to thank us by blessing us all with a tiny spark of magic, that we three then slowly developed into a small flame after years of training and practice."
9,">The problem is that I can't seem to find the DC for this save anywhere

The DC is in the same category as the Superiority Dice. It's 8 + your proficiency bonus + either your DEX modifier or your STR modifier."
9,"> Jesus is the son/lamb of god, so he wouldnt ever be.

Damn, Teddy. Your knowledge on the Christian Lore is whack, my guy. Let me educate you a bit.

Almost every Christian denomination believes in the ""Holy Trinity"" - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. All three are ""God"". They're *technically the same thing*, even though *virtually* they are not. It's kind of fucked up and confusing, but yeah. Eastern Orthodox, Catholics and Protestants (aka biggest denominations, making up the vast vast VAST majority of christians) believe that all three make up the ""God"" as we know him and our perception of him. 

What **you're** talking about are the [***nontrinitarians***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontrinitarianism) who believe that the god **isn't** a Trinity. They make up a lot of funny little cults like the Jehovah's Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and similar. They make up a **vast minority** of christianity.

So yeah, Jesus is 100% considered to be a god by the vast and dominant majority of Christians. 

>AO is the omnipotent, omnipresent overgod like God.

You know what, you got a point, just not the point you are hoping to make. I talked about how the Father is similar to Amaunator, and how the Son is similar to Ilmater, but I totally ignored the Holy Spirit. Now the Holy Spirit is lowkey similar to Ao and would be the closest representation of that."
9,"So? OP didn't ask who's the overgod of D&D. He asked which of the existing deities is most similar to the Christian god (which is either Yahweh or Jesus). 

And Ao isn't like Yahweh or like Jesus.

So it literally doesn't matter that Ao is the overgod. Ao is nothing like the christian god, as a matter of fact, aside from the fact that he created the universe (which is literally 1% of the Christian ""lore"", so to speak). And OP didn't ask what god created the universe in D&D."

The ability works when you ***hit*** a creature. You **can't know if you hit, before you make the attack roll**.

>Are the examples of abilities that /do/ require you to make a melee attack before adding damage to it so I can compare the language?

Yes, Divine Smite, lol. I assume you meant examples of abilities that require you to apply a resource *before* you know if you hit? If so, a good example of that are the Smite Spells (i.e. Branding Smite), which need to be pre-cast."
9,"/r/HungryArtists, /r/StarvingArtists, [Artists & Clients](https://artistsnclients.com/).

Good luck!"
9,">then the enemies would take their turn

Which enemy of the many enemies acts first, though? Which acts second? Etc.

Alternatively, what would happen if all players did all actions in time? What, all players just act first, before the enemies, at all times?

How do you decide if the first turn belongs to the enemies or to the party?

>Would this be good for the game?

No.

>What would be lost?

Planning, unique and creative ideas that are born out of people thinking about what abilities they have and the situation they're in. Coming up with ""*Okay, so Johnny will cast Jump on Billy. I'm going to haste billy. Then Jacky will ready an action to put her shield up as a stepping stone. Then billy, on his turn, will charge at jacky, jacky will use her reaction and throw billy up into the air so he can get on top of that dragon and hang onto it, slashing at its wings to try and get it down to the ground*"" will be nearly impossible. You'll instead be hearing a lot more ""**I choose to attack**"", instead.

>What would be gained?

Slightly shorter combats, I guess? And tons of newbie stress. Assuming you have a well-oiled party of people who know the system, you might be able to shave off ~1-4 minutes off combat this way, I suppose.

>How could we make this work?

Introducing initiative roles to see who goes in what order, and then putting everyone on a timer, I guess."
9,"Depends on which time you're talking about, which of the many D&D settings, and which of the christian gods you are talking about (Old Testament's Yahwe? New Testament's Jesus?). Assuming Forgotten Realms:

- The old Big Daddy God would likely be **Amaunator**. He's hyper lawful, a deity of order, and is a harsh god that doesn't mind smiting and searing the flesh of those who wrong him. Then again, ""**[Ayo, Abraham, go kill your son in my honor. Lmao, just kidding, chill out.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac)**"" is something that a Neutral or even Chaotic deity could do to test their followers, so that Amaunator thing is kind of up in the air. 
- My boy Jesus MF Christ is probably closest to **Ilmater**. Ilmater is also a martyr, and he really has the same theme of helping people in need, same as Jesus."
9,So? You can reflavor things in AL. You just can't change the mechanics.
9,"Bullshit. Citation needed. You can reflavor and refluff things in any way you want as long as the GM is on board and you don't change any mechanics. 

I guess if you want to be really anal you could say that changing the neck slot into a belt slot is a mechanical change, but that'd have no effect on the rules, which say: ""*Use Common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn*"". 

Wearing three amulets or three belts 100% fits in with common sense."
9,">my character can cast charm person as a ritual

There is no rules as written feature that would allow you to cast Charm Person as a ritual. You're using a homebrew rule, so any question about that homebrew rule should be asked to the person who created that homebrew rule.

>Could I, in a party setting, cast it that way while gently interacting with the target across those ten minutes?

No, because the spellcasting components' description in the PHB is rather clear about what those components are:

- Verbal components must have the right tonality. You can't just deliver it in a quieter or louder way.
- Somatic components are forceful movements (and the RAI is that you shouldn't be able to hide a somatic component in a pocket, since you can't deliver the component even if you have a shield strapped to your forearm without right feat)
- Material components must be held

So to answer your question, no, by RAW you can't weave it into a normal conversation. As a matter of fact, that's a **subclass feature** of the College of Glamour for the bard - charming a person as a part of reciting a poem or performing a dance.

>do I have to see the target for the entirety of the casting

Yes, and they have to stay within range."
9,">That these games are born out of a desire to have fun with friends.

That's not true at all, if you go to something as simple as /r/LFG or Roll20's LFG where **people who apply literally do not know each other**. They aren't friends (yet). 

People there come because they want to play D&D. And sometimes the way they want to play D&D is very much different from how other people want to play D&D. So, *if your way of playing D&D comes at a price of having other people not enjoy D&D* - one could argue that you're playing D&D wrong, since the intention is for **everyone** to enjoy themselves, not just a single person.

>Now who's ready to discuss the mechanical use of the Blowgun?

By RAW there's almost no reez to use it, unless you're in a situation where a crack of the crossbow or a longbow would be significantly more loud than a blowgun shot.

Also, might as well use it if you're an assassin rogue who's hunting a commoner, who can be killed with a single sneak attack. And you'd only prefer the blowgun over another weapon simply because you can hide the weapon in your sleeve."
9,It functions exactly like an Amulet of Health.
9,"No, it's a RAW rare item from the DMG. Look up Amulet of Health."
9,">What belt is this?


There is no *belt* specifically, but this item is called an ***Amulet of Health*** and it sets the wearer's Constitution score to 19. The GM just reflavored it to be a belt, likely."
9,"I don't get the mechanic. You just explained how to obtain the ability, but not what it does."
9,"As I've said, grab a dungeoneering kit and off you go. Think about what your character would take."
9,I will. Dogs are d u m b.
9,">without giving me spoilers, what should i buy to help out down in the dungeon?

Why do you want to cheat by getting meta knowledge, despite not wanting to cheat?

If you don't want to cheat - don't ask for suggestions that will give you a meta advantage down in the dungeon, because your character somehow magically knew what to prepare for the delve.

Grab a dungeoneering kit and off you go. Explore, experiment, and learn from your mistakes, as your character would have done."
9,">I was wondering if anyone who has done this before could offer some guidance?

I haven't read those books cover to cover until a few months ago, years after I started playing D&D. You really don't need to read EVERYTHING, but it can definitely help you improve your games immediately. 

So you either stumble around and learn bit by bit over months and years as you learn from your mistakes, or you could just take a week to read them.

> Which books would be useful to read entirely

The PHB. Hands down. Everything else is just useful, but the PHB is **really** useful.

>how long would it take?

Impossible to tell. Depends entirely on what sort of person you are. You could read it in two days. Or you could be reading it for a month."

9,">you need at least two friends to play D&D

Not necessarily. 1 on 1 campaigns can be very fun in their own right and are very unique, compared to 1 on 4 standard campaigns. So much so that the newest D&D adventure from the Essentials Kit has rules on how to run it with 1 DM and 1 player.

>I don't have friends except school friends that have potato brains and can't understand D&D

I think I can guess why you don't have many friends. Not assuming someone's intelligence can be a solid way to gain more friends.

>I would love if someone or anyone could join me in an adventure

You're looking for /r/LFG."
9,">The game moving at a snail’s pace - particularly in combat.

What exactly is moving at a snail's pace? The GM turns? because this can totally be a player issue.

>A complete lack of pacing or energy at the table.

Once again, not necessarily a GM problem. Pacing and energy issues come mostly from players, in my experience. A lot of people like pointing at GMs for bad games, but in my opinion, good players are equally as rare as good GMs. 

Not saying you're in that situation, necessarily, but it might be that you and your fellow players are the ones not putting enough energy into the game, or players aside from you are draining it by being very passive.

>The DM isn’t really making progress on his understanding of the rules

What does he say if you bring it up?

>some of the rules that have been brought into the game feel like they’re in place just to work against the players

Why? Seems like that rule would work against monsters just as much as players. But either way, new rule changes should have been discussed at session 0.

>There’s no real “mood” to the game’s narration.

And why do you think that is?

>The humor being used at the table is always very immature. I like a humorous death for a baddie as much as the next guy, but this stuff is just sort of annoying.

Again, if you brought it up before, what was the response?

>He doesn’t call his rolls to attack, or his creature’s saves.

The vast majority of the tables work like that, so there's not much you can do about it. If this really irks you - look for another game.

>He roots against the players

That's just a preference thing. Again, if you don't like that - I'd look for another game, because this is by no means a unique thing. Rooting against the players isn't the same as having the players forcefully lose in order to feel elation. 

>He seems to be irked whenever a player says “I do this or that” and will mention that he’s the DM and decides what actually happens.

Yep, that's 100% on the players. The GM *is* the one who decides what happens and what does not. Players say what they want to do, or what they are in the process of doing. 

>On top of that, we know that the game may fall apart if we were to drop out.

You probably lived on this earth long enough to know not to burn yourself to keep others warm. If you're not feeling it - just leave. Let them solve things out. The GM clearly isn't on board with everything that's happening, too.

>You cannot improve at DMing without practice

Oh up to a certain point you 100% can. There's a lot of theoretical knowledge that comes into play when GMing. Theoretical knowledge that you simply might not reveal to yourself when playing.

>I need to figure out a way to handle this without offending the DM

If you tried talking with him before, and it clearly isn't working out - just say that you're not really feeling it anymore, you're kind of stressed playing so much D&D and say you'd like to bow out. No friendship worth a damn will be ruined over that."
9,"Precisely. And don't forget that since a Cleric is a full caster - you're not losing out on any spell slots. Sure, you won't be getting higher level spells are fast as you would if you stayed a singleclass druid, but you can still upcast spells, and cast as many spells per day as you normally would."
9,"Well, I usually use average, unless I either roll or ""roll"".

I roll if I feel like I want to show off some difference between the creatures. I.e. one goblin is more tough, one goblin is more tiny etc.

I also like ""rolling"" to show off how badass some legendary creatures are. For example, I always use the highest HP roll for a Tarrasque. Or I set a higher than average HP for a legendary Ancient Dragon in the setting."
9,"Barbarian wouldn't work, since you can't concentrate on any spells when Raging. So you'd... just be a barbarian.

9,"You haven't typed Rogue correctly even once. Don't bring up spelling correction. We should all strive to be better.

>But as a bard no matter how elaborate or creative I get I cant cast an illusion stealthily

Yep. Neither can Warlocks, Wizards, Clerics, Druids, Paladins, Rangers, Eldritch Knights or Arcane Tricksters, as a matter of fact. The only ones who can are Sorcerers through the Subtle Spell metamagic.

> Rogues* are just special and logic only applies to them

It's not logic. It's a specialized power and training that they get.

> It just doesn't make sense

It doesn't make sense that only a trained warrior knows how to move efficiently in heavy armor?

It doesn't make sense that only a specialized agent can gain expertise in a skill?

It doesn't make sense that only a learned mage can inscribe magic?

It doesn't make sense that only a divinely blessed person can evoke divinities?

It doesn't make sense that only a trained bard can magically enhance their allies?

It doesn't make sense that only a trained battle master knows how to weave attacks in a more efficient way?

No, ***it all makes sense***, because it's all a part of training as a class. It's 100% logical.

9,"Depends on how large the farmland region is, I guess.

One fun idea I had employed before was an elemental portal. So you say that the game takes place during winter. The party may be hanging about in one of the towns of the region, when they hear some peasants mention that only a single day of travel north of here, one village doesn't have any snow at all. On the contrary, it's incredibly hot in there, as if it was the middle of summer in a southern country.

If the party investigates, they might find out that a wild portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire has opened in the region, emitting mass amounts of heat around it, melting the snow. The party may deal with some mephits roaming the area, take out a wildfire caused to the tundra, and take out the Fire Elemental protecting the portal, and then dispelling it using (a scroll of) Dispel Magic."
9,"> rouge

>Why does only a specific kind of rouge get to base themselves on illusions

No rogue bases themselves on illusions. Arcane Tricksters can cast many other spells, too.

> I feel like if bard happens to take only illusion spells and builds themselves for stealth (wich I may or may not have done) they should be allowed to have stealth advantages on illusions. 

A bard isn't a specialized magical assassin that focuses on surprising enemies. ***A rogue, is.*** You want to force enemies to have disadvantages on saves against your illusions - multiclass into an Arcane Trickster.

>Stuggling with this decision, any reccomendations?

For your goal of achieving damage comparable to cantrips? Ranger is the best, because you get access to a Longbow and Hunter's Mark, however it uses up a concentration. The Rogue is better if you're okay with slightly lower damage, but free concentration and a bunch of utility through Expertise and Cunning Action."

Narcotic also isn't a damage type :P

You ***do not*** want percentage calculations in your D&D game, I *promise* you that. The whole point of 5e is to play it with as few calculations as possible, and calculating % damage would be ridiculous even in 3e and other, more number crunchy games. So no, don't do this.

>any feedback would be appreciated

Butlers aren't adventurers. All classes in the PHB require a large degree of training, aside from the Warlock and the Sorcerer, which kind of gain most of their powers through their background.

In other words - think about what sort of training would it be realistic for the butler to have. Basically, you have to extend your character. Being a butler may be his current occupation, but not his specialization, for example. Or maybe as part of being a butler he was also trained as a bodyguard. Think about it, essentially."

Everything below assumes Forgotten Realms with the default 5e rules suggested in the rulebooks.

>Is mkst of the population below that line like are all adventurers rich

Good adventurers are rich, yes. Waterdeep, the biggest city in the Forgotten Realms setting, has a ward  that is full of adventurers that struck it rich. Adventuring is a dangerous prospect, but it can be very *very* profitable.

> there are shops that sell a magic item for 5000

Yes, and that's not even the upper limit. 5k gp is about an okay price for a Rare magical item. Very Rare items may be the family treasure of a large noble clan. A Legendary item may be hidden in the deepest vaults of a large nation. Worlds-spanning wars may be waged for Artifacts. 

>1 gold is like $80

It's very hard to put that sort of metric on money. For example, a suit of plate armor right now costs around ~7000 USD. It's 1500 gp in D&D. Does that mean that 1 gp = ~4.6$? Not necessarily, because they didn't have the tools to make plate armor as easily as we do now. Then again, sometimes they did (through spells like Fabricate).

As such, it's basically impossible to compare GP to real world money.

>Questions are there mages that are like doctors? 

Depends on the setting, but yes, in FR, there are. Clerics and Druids, mostly.

> Like you give em 100 gold and they change your sex. 

Nope, that'd require a Wish spell or a magical item to switch your sex, which would cost you around a 1-10 thousand gold.

> How much for a sepcially made orc saddle

- If everyone in the party enjoys working against each other - then yes, go dedicated and sell out the rogue.
- If everyone in the party plays along, then try to play it a bit more loose with the rules. These sorts of parties don't like Lawful Stupid, either.
- If you feel like the Rogue is comitting evil deeds in your non-evil party - talk to him about it in-game and kick him out, if he's not fitting. Why would you be in a party with someone who you can't trust?

- Zariel is a warlord. She is fixated on it and judges people based on their combat prowess. So the most logical and simple thing she'd need from her Warlock is to join her warband. 
- She, as most devils, absolutely hates demons. So she might be nurturing and growing a warlock to slay powerful Demonic general for her, to aid in the Blood War.
- She dislikes political machinations that other devils participate in, so likely wouldn't desire any subterfuge from her warlock, but she might also be interested in making the warlock into a skilled general to lead lower devils in combat against the demonic hordes.

EDIT:

9,"> there's 5 diffrent types of freeze pistols, why?

In one word: **Technology**.

Look even to the real world. Sure, there are airsoft pistols. They're cool, can deal some damage. However, if you have the right permission (level), you can now grab a classic colt 1911. A reliable side arm, deals significantly more damage than an airsoft pistol.

However, if you know you'll be fighting heavily armored foes - you'll grab a sidearm with even more penetration, such as a Desert Eagle, so you can totally blow through them.

And that's just our normal average modern weapon system. In the sci fi future of starfinder, there are way more technologies. it's *most* apparent when using melee weapons:

- You can get a normal forged longsword. It's got good cutting power, but there are creatures who's carapace evolved to resist solar radiation, and heavy atmospheres, so it won't do much against those.
- You can then upgrade your normal longsword to a Sintered longsword. The powder coalesced into a blade gives harder cutting power, creating better cutting capabilities to a normal longsword.
- When that simply isn't cutting it anymore (heh), you can grab a sword made out of more durable materials with thousands of microscoping microserrations delivered by a precise mechanism, which causes significantly greater bleeding and cutting power.
- When you realize simple mechanical design won't give you many other advantages - you look to science to boost the damage output further. Grab a molecular destabilizer and forcefully agitate the molecules comprising the longsword so they make a constantly active and shifting disruption field creating a *molecular riftblade*. It's so powerful that by the lore of the setting you actually have to carry it around in a special magnetic sheath to avoid cutting yourself by just holding the blade.
- If you're fighting real space horrors, or evil corporations that utilizes the rarest minerals to create incomprehensibly hard armor, you need to get a state-of-the-art weapon to match. Enter the **dimensional slice sword**, a weapon created after years of research by the leading weapon manufacturers. The technology behind its creation is a trade secret, but the metal comprising the blade has shifted so much that it looks almost like an aura surrounding the blade's core. The agitated molecules have unrivaled cutting power, to the point that the wielder can cut a car in half with a single swing (whopping 14d8 damage).

So, that's why there's a weapon scaling - **there are different technologies**.

Same idea for the ranged weapons. Laser weapons get more powerful ray emitters, frost weapons get more powerful cryogenic crystals etc."
9,">difference between a paladin and a cleric

>the reason i dont like SF is because it seems to focus on the clunky modifier bonuses or is that just the surface?

I believe that 5e has more general modifiers than SF if you're playing your average Soldier.

In Starfinder you'll be adding you ability mod and your attack bonus to your attack roll (which is always equal to your Soldier level) and a -4 if you're making a full attack.

In 5e you'll be adding your ability bonus, your proficiency bonus and then sometimes also additional superiority dice, a -5 from GWM, and additional bonus dice from spells.

In SF your damage dice will be adding the weapon's dice + your Strength modifier, and then if you choose the right gear bonus, you'll also be adding an additional bonus modifier to the damage.

In 5e you'll be adding your weapon's dice, your enchantment dice, your ability mod, your superiority dice.

In general, it's all pretty much the same. Sometimes 5e has more modifiers (normally related to combat). Sometimes SF has more modifiers (almost always related to Skills).

Also, Starfinder currently has less feats than 5e, so there's that, too.

>it seemed needlessly complex for the story i want to tell

If you ignore the optional vehicle and starship combat rules, the system is equally as simple as 5e. Actually, simpler in some ways. Starfinder *only* has Point Buy, for example. Starfinder also has an in-universe item that lets you respec your character, too, so bad options don't completely ruin your character without the needs for deus ex machina, homebrew items, or rewriting of history."
9,">DISCLAIMER: I’ll be focusing on the bard spell list, so no Magical Secrets picks here. 

I feel like making a guide on Bardic spell picks without paying ***A LOT*** of attention to one of the most interesting and unique features in the bard's class is a huge loss and is a huge oversight that you will hopefully rectify very soon.

>Level 1 bard spells

Mentioning best level 1 Bardic spells without Dissonant Whispers is a huge oversight, once again. Sure, Faerie Fire is situationally very nice, however it uses up your concentration and also targets the most common saving throw in the game.

Compare that to Dissonant Whispers, which not only deals psychic damage, but also may trigger attacks of opportunity from every single melee character around the enemy, which can lead to an entire cascade of damage, as Rogues apply their sneak attack damage an additional time, Barbarians strike with the Great Weapon Mastery and not even mentioning the War Caster booming blades and other hijinks.

>Level 2 Bard spells

No Silence, that can totally disable some spellcasters? No Phantasmal Force? No Heat Metal? Come on, now. Invisibility isn't even that good, since you can't use it in combat too effectively.

The rest are cool. 

>Wizard Builds

*Bladesinging?* Non-heavy armor Cleric dip? These are not very optimized, if you're making a ""Top 3"" build.

- War Magic and Abjuration allows you to have a ton of survivability already.
- Pure evocation is excellent on a wizard, especially if you're playing a dungeon delve.
- Enchantment Wizard multiclassed with Sorcerer is god-tier in urban and social campaigns.

>Rogue Subclasses

Putting Thief on the 4th place is silly, without making a huge disclamer in red that the archetype is ***very weak*** if you aren't playing in a game that showers you with magical items of all kinds and types. You're supposed to be a gadgeteer/poisoner/trapper in a game system that barely has any gadgets/poisons/traps.

>Lv1 Wizard Spells

You put Shield over the classical Magic Missile? Really?

>Lv2

Again with the invisibility. It's nice, but it's not *that* great, due to how Hiding works in 5e. Being Invisible doesn't mean being undetectable!

Nope, you won't. Can't do that. Read the description of the spell: ""*If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.*""

So no, you can't dimension door into its stomach.

Also, before you say ""*But i'm teleporting into the empty space in its stomach*"" - objects inside the creature are considered the creature. You can't target individual parts of the creature, because it's all considered *a creature*, until it dies.

You also likely won't be able to slide into his stomach normally, because it's smarter than that and would just tear you apart with its massive fangs, first.

Depends on what you want, doesn't it?

- GWM will increase your greatsword damage, which is good. However, putting a -5 to an attack roll for your cantrip usually isn't a very good idea. It is excellent if you want to just haste yourself and go to town. Generally a great option if you just want to deal more damage and don't use cantrips for damage output.
- Magic Initiate gives you some more versatility, however, if you already picked your EK cantrips well, you likely don't *really* need more. A good alternative to this is the ***Ritual Caster (Wizard)*** feat, as it allows you to get high level wizard magic **at the same pace as a full wizard**. That means that even at level 5 you could have a Phantom Steed that can move 200 feet per turn. And that you will eventually be able to cast a 6th level wizard spell (Telepathic Bond). Not to mention utility stuff like Find Familiar and Tenser's Disk.
- War Caster lets you apply spells as a reaction, which, for an EK, is usually only good for Booming Blade. If your GM is gracious with Attacks of Opportunity in your game - this is an excellent pick, as it lets you save your few spell slots on concentration spells and also apply more damage on Attacks of Opportunity. If your GM rarely gives them to you - I'd go for something else as, as good as concentration advantages are, you can already likely keep the spell on through Indomitable."

>No, but you might tell him a lie he wants to hear

And charismatic intimidation works around that factor *how*, exactly? That's an issue with all intimidation attempts, no matter if you're blackmailing, strongarming or torturing someone.

>Intimidation is about obtaining the subject's cooperation in a manner that advances your goals

That's not what intimidation is. From the SRD: ""*When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.*""

So yes, literally pushing your ass to the wall and placing a huge muscled arm around your neck, capable of snapping it with ease, is 100% an example of a good intimidation attempt in 5e.

Meld into Stone specifically says you have to enter a ""*stone object*"". Animate objects specifies that ""*An animated object is a construct*"".

As such - this plan wouldn't work RAW.

Now I guess you could try to spin that meld into stone's ""stone surface"" implies that you can enter anything that has a surface and is made out of stone, but that's very clearly not intended, due to the previous thing mentioned (it has to be an object).

- Attunement is confusing. Attunement is **magical**. It's not something you learn. You can attune to an item as you practice with it, but that means that you might also need to re-practice if you lose attunement. Additionally, attunement is supposed to be entered in the same line as rarity.
- That's not the right formatting for actions and bonus actions. It should go ""*As an action, you can X*"".
- Magical items in 5e are standardly writter as if you're addressing someone. I.e. ""**You** can use the gauntlet to do XYZ"". Or ""*When attuned,* **you** *gain...*""
- 5e doesn't have standard actions.
- Ranged attack is not an action. You make a ranged attack as a part of an attack action. *Also*, all attacks in 5e have two types: they're either a weapon attack or a spell attack. No exceptions. It's better for you to rewrite it as ""*As an action, you make a ranged weapon attack at a target within range.*""
- Objects don't get grappled. They get held.
- The ""creature/operator"" paragraph is mega confusing. Needs a total rewrite. I have read it like 3 times and I still am not sure about what it does. So if you're of the same size or smaller than the creature you grappled using REACH - you can make an opposed athletics check to knock them prone. So how can a tiny quickling with REACH knock a gargantuan ancient black dragon prone with this?
- What's the DC to remove the hook?
- Why would you break the device as a bonus action? Is it the only way to release the grappled creature?
- Movement isn't an action. So the paragraph that explains that you can move twice as fast towards the creature is kinda confusing in practical terms.

If you shortened this to make this a nice and sweet 3-4 paragraphs, and talked more about your training, instead of the lore of the world, this can be a solid 8/10 (primarily because it's so ordinary and there's nothing *too* unique about it): there are good leads to backstory NPCs, good potential story hooks, personal bonds, living friends and family...

The second bonus is useless, and the first one interacts weirdly with Defensive Duelist. Attacking prone targets in melee already gives you advantage on the attack roll. There's no need to grapple.

9,"Thing is, Puzzles, Mysteries and travelling huge distances is exactly the type of stuff that doesn't offer *any* challenge at high levels. 

Moving from Luskan to Sigil is an epic storyline at level 1. At level 20, on the other hand, it's literally an action away, as you cast Plane Shift.

Puzzles can almost always be completely ignored or worked around. Not always, for sure, and they can be a very effective tool, but you need to step up your puzzle game, as well.

Mystery is nice, but it's hard to keep, when the cleric can divine pretty much everything in the world, and the wizard can hear whispers from creatures from Outer Planes.

Roleplaying is nice, and definitely is ineteresting, but I don't think it is a challenge.

The most direct way to challenge level 20 players is, indeed, combat. You just have to be very smart about it. **Conditions are the name of the game**. A GM running a lv20 game must be a total master of the art of conditions, how to inflict them and how they operate. They are the way you will bend the players to your will.

Additionally, level 9 spells are also a huge boon. Sure, the wizard is OP as fuck with his Simulacrum and Forcecage, *but enemy wizards can employ these, too*. Learning how to dispel, counterspell and incapcaitate is crucial at challenging high level players.

Finally, the GM has what I consider to be the ultimate high level tools to even the playing field - Legendary Actions and **Power Word Kill**. Sure, high level players have a lot of resurrecting options, but you actually need to be able to resurrect.

It does require you to step up your DMing game, and actually get good at weaving all the mechanics of the game, but it's 100% possible to challenge the players and make a VERY entertaining game that is significantly different from a low level experience. It feels like a totally different game."

- High level mages aren't *that* overpowering in D&D. Wizards have an issue with the fact that Forcecage, Simulacrum and Wish almost completely negate some challenges.

>I'd change fighter

Are you intentionally ignoring the weaponmaster flavor? The most classical and archetypical warrior hero, that is such a master with the blade, such a deadshot with its longbow, such a skilled defender that it becomes its own special thing? Aka a thing that has been raised in pretty much every single fantasy-themed thing... ever?

Changing the fighter is just ridiculous, frankly. Like absolutely, *incomprehensibly* ridiculous.

9,">I'm unsure how to fit in best

Here's the thing with 5e: ***literally EVERYTHING fits***. This isn't 2e or 3e. You can play literally any party combination you want - and you'll be a good party. Sure, you won't be the absolute best at everything, but finding solutions to problems is half of the fun in D&D, and can be much more enjoyable than just handwaving it with a spell, sometimes.

For example, your party ""lacks"" a healer. So, your first idea would be to go something like a Life Cleric. Except you can instead choose to go Draconic Sorcerer or Battle Master Fighter and just absolutely annihilate enemies before they can even hurt you that much that you'd need healing.

So, to answer your question: ***play anything you want***. Don't try to artificially fit into the party, because it's a very sub optimal way to play D&D.

If you're absolutely dedicated to maximizing your party - you're lacking a divine caster / healer. If you want to minmax:

- Go Life Domain cleric so you can heal people up.
- Go Lore or Glamour Bard so you can support people.
- Go Dreams or Shepherd Druid so you can both heal people up and support the party in a utilitarian sense."
9,"> ""Why can't this be a Paladin subclass?"" 

Because you change the mechanics? Change it from someone who adapts to nature into someone who is directly affected by nature and can take on some special traits based on the terrain they're in. That'd alter the class significantly, give them a class identity and you'll have your nature martial.

>its flavour would be just as troublesome to implement as the Ranger's too, because of how much it would overlap with either Paladin or Druid.

Does it matter? Rogues, Barbarians and Fighters all have a similar flavor - martial dudes that stab people."
9,">especially seeing how the wild shapes you can take when not a Moon Druid are underpowered in comparison

Wild Shape on any druid is an ***insanely*** potent utility tool. You can turn into a tiny spider and automatically become more unassuming and stealthy than a master rogue. Turning into a Bear allows you to get a strong form so you can accomplish strength-related tasks (bend bars, break barriers etc) that'd normally be impossible for your DEX druid.

I don't think I need to explain how useful it is to just fly for a while, and flying forms provide just that. It's essentially two castings of the Polymorph spell per *short* rest, on self. It's super duper useful, even if you don't wild shape in combat.

The solution isn't to remove Wild Shape, but to do for every subclass what Circle of Spores did - give every Druidic subclass an alternate option on how to use Wild Shape. I've already done it with my homebrew rework of the class, which made its entirety so much more enjoyable to play, for me and mine.

> which features in which classes don't really sit well with you

Honestly? None. I think they're all in a perfect place and shouldn't be moved or altered. I like some features less than others, but that's just details. I can't say that I think some features are out of place or forcing you in. 

I guess you could say that some of the Ranger features are kinda meh (i.e. Favored enemy), but I just **despise** the concept of the Ranger class and have hated it in every edition that it appeared in. I have an unpopular opinion that Ranger as a nature fighter should, in fact, be simply another archetype for the Fighter - more of a scout with some 1/3 nature magic. Then you replace the Ranger with a Nature Paladin, like a Warden and off you go."

>Deific Voodoo

So, this allows you to automatically hit a creature by turning someone into a pincushion? This requires playtesting. Could be okay, but could be quite broken. Especially because it allows you to easily hit enemies that are otherwise really annoying to fight (i.e. Rakshasa).

>Pure Evisceration

Again, more than half of these creature types straight up don't exist in 5e.

Uh... Yeah...

>Mark of Reassurance

Lol.

>Choose 1 of the Following: Saving Throws, Physical Attacks, Spell Attacks, when chosen, you gain Advantage on what you chose when dealing with that creature as long as you can perceive it

>Immortal

Also, nice, a better immortality feature than any other class (both Druids and Monks simply get extended life).

>Grand Protector

Shield of Faith, with no concentration, lasting forever, and also grants temporary HP? Do I need to explain why it's broken?

>Give an Recieve

A better Life Domain feature, lol.

>Radiant Surge

Bad wording. Also, dealing 4d10 damage to any amount of creatures within a huge aoe makes horde encounters pretty much completely trivial. Bad design, bad balancing and also bad wording.

>Hand of the divine

""incompacitated"". Lol.

A reaction Heal. Sure, whatever.

This one actually isn't that bad, compared to the rest of the stuff you have here.

>Binding

Bad wording, unclear what this actually does after the initial effect.

>Instant sever

""incompacitated"" lol

Sure bro, lob off enemy limbs at the cost of a level 1 spell slot. Why not.

>Celestial Assistant

Oh, a CR10 summon at level 12? With **no concentration**. When a Druid can conjure a single CR6 creature, requiring concentration and it goes berserk once it's broken? And you can then also summon two of them?

Yeah, again, ***ridiculously*** broken, but that's a theme.

>Deific Resurrection

This is fine.

>Divine Blessings

Sure, this is fine.

>Energy Sacrifice

Bad wording (didn't specify what attack). Other than that, I'm pretty certain this is absolutely broken and turns single fights into an absolute joke, especially with multiple Deity players. Needs playtesting.

>Energy Swam

36d10 autohit damage? Sigh.

>Cage

Awful to use in 5e, since battle sizes are calculated by 5 feet, so 8 feet at a side will be super confusing.

>Ship

A medium ship can't hold 30 people in 5e. Read Ghosts of Saltmarsh.

>Spell List

I'm sorry, but this class broke me. I don't have it in me to gauge the spell list.

***Overall:*** This is one of the most ridiculously and disgustingly overpowered classes I have ever seen in all of my years as a homebrewer and a member of the community. I'm talking like Top 3 or maybe even top 2. I don't want to lie to you - this is unsalvageable. You need to start from the beginning. There are *some* interesting ideas here (the way you made invocations ""stack""), but everything else is just absolutely terrible."
9,"Oh my god, this thing was a total trip. I don't think I'll ever forget this class. This is *something*.

Use homebrewery or GMBinder if you want people to take your brew seriously.

> so far it seems pretty solid and fun while not out shining the other members of the party

There's absolutely no way that's happening after level 5. I am writing this after I've written everything below, and this is **easily** either the most overpowered or second most overpowered class I have ever seen homebrewed by anyone, especially at higher levels.

The class reads as if you wanted to have a Wizard, that's also a Warlock, that's also a Paladin, that's also a Cleric, that's also a Monk, that's also a Druid. All in one, with HP stackable to a barbarian, heavy armor, and everything else.

>You are a deity

Within the lore of established5e settings, divinity makes you truly immortal. Even demigods, who technically aren't fully gods, are also immortal and can give magic to people. It makes you an exarch to a greater deity very often, which has awe-inspiring powers in and of itself.

TLDR - **it's whack lore**. Also, this should be exceptionally hard to roleplay without a massive superiority complex.

Another thing to consider is that **even level 20 adventurers aren't deities**. Not only are they not deities, they aren't even *quasi-deities*. They're just... Really strong adventurers.

My boy Vecna had to experience immense agony and bodily transformation to eventually ascend to divinity, and years before that he was forced to abandon all humanity and become an immortal lich.

So yeah, the lore, the name and the theme here doesn't really lend itself to good adventuring, in my opinion. It can also be very inconsistent with existing settings.

But let's move on to the features.

>Features unlocked at specific levels and ability scores.

Why though? Like, it's just busywork. The math is also completely pointlessly complex.

If you don't want them to have d6 HP of a wizard, nor d12 HP of a barbarian - say they have 1d8 + CON HP. There's no need for whatever you made there.

Same thing with heavy armor proficiency. If you don't want the base class to have it - **make it a subclass feature**.

>Weapons... Dependant on upbringing

Oh no you don't, OP. Either give guidelines on how to pick them, or say they have proficiency with all weaponry.

>Tools

Noting the GM in a class mechanical ability is an example of bad design 99,9% of times. This is one of those times.

Say that they can have one tool proficiency and leave it at that.

>Saving Throws

Oh no you don't. You better specify what they are, because, again, this is just confusing. You specified what your ""Main"" score is, but what's a ""Side"" score?

>Skills 

Same as the above. Also, ***five skill proficiencies?*** You get more proficiencies than an expert rogue?? And you think that's *balanced*, when you also give them the flexibility, opportunism and power of mages?

Yeah nah, guv.

>Equipment

They start with no armor?

>Divinity points

Give me *one* reason why not to remove one 0 from all divinity points used in this class? There's absolutely no need to have them in the hundreds. It's, again, bulky and intimidating.

>Three Cantrips

So not only do you get more skills than an expert rogue, but you also get the cantrips of a wizard?

>Preparing spells

Wait, so you can't restore spell slots and change your prepared spells in a single long rest? Why?

>Steal Magic

First of all, this again clashes with the existing concepts of spell casting in 5e. So are you learning magic and casting it through patterns as a Wizard, or do you have the inherent magic of a sorcerer? 

Secondly, how do you imagine players remembering what spells they casted before? Especially in longer campaigns?

Thirdly, a Wizard has to spend 2 x Spell Level **hours** AND a ton of money to inscribe a single spell. Your Divine boy can inscribe them in **minutes** and completely for free? So you're better at keeping a spellbook than a Wizard? Alright.

>You may obtain spells equal to your main ability score modifier + half prof. Bonus(rounded down)

Confusing sentence. Do you mean the number of spells? Or the level of spells?

Also, there is no ""Arcane"" check. There's an Intelligence (Arcana) check.

>Also, you may only cast lower level spells as higher levels of which you have within your available spell level range.

What does this mean?

>Unusual spell

Oh, so you also give them better flexibility than Bards, capable of choosing **literally** any arcane or divine spell at the end of a long rest?

I don't know about this.

>Divinity Point Regeneration

Wait **you what?** Let me translate this feature to, say, a Wizard:

""*As a bonus action you can restore 1d6 levels of spell slots, dividing them as you wish. This scales to 1d8, 1d10 and 1d20 spell slots at higher levels. You regain the use of this feature after a short or long rest*"".

This means that starting at level 5 you can ***cast all day long***, as you recover MORE spells than a Warlock AND gain infinite spellcasting per day after a short rest.

**I can't even begin to describe how overpowered this is.**

This feature should be completely removed. This class doesn't need Spell Recovery at all, judging by how much other power and utility you gave them.

>Tongue of Gods

First of all, you have to specify how to activate this. Action? Bonus action? Reaction?

Secondly, advantage on speech checks for free means that you're essentially getting a **significantly better Tongue of Sun And Moon** feature of the Monk. That ain't it.

Thirdly, the creature classification is very very confusing. There is no ""Divine"" creature type. There is no ""Angelic"" creature type. There are ""Celestial"" creatures and there are ""Fey"" creatures.

Finally, you didn't specify when this ability recharges.

>Risen God

First of all, in all official settings no gods will recognize your might. Greater Deities ignore even demigods, despite them *actually being immortal*, unlike this guy. 

Secondly, the feature lasts an hour. Why does the AC bonus last only 10 minutes?

Finally, spell upcasting for free is an absolute dream, making you a better spellcaster than pretty much any other spellcaster in the game.

>Godly attribute

So is it fly or levitate? Avoid ""/"" if you can.

Also, sure, give them the tempest capstone as well. Why not.

>Mortal Mistake

This is very cheap ability that rivals (and sometimes full on beats) the Paladin of Redemption **capstone**. And this is a Tier 1 ability.

>Vengeance

Why would you want to damage your ally?

>Divine Streak

Wait, so the Divinity Point cost doesn't increase? So you can get an 8d10 damage aoe attack that requires the point analogue of a 1st level spell to cast? Do I even need to explain why it's overpowered?

>Divine Deliverance

So this is a **better** Second Wind feature of the fighter? Alright man, cool.

>I am With You

So an increased chance to hit that stacks with Bless and all other features? This is bad for a few reasons.

For one, this is overpowered, because it lets you stack attack bonuses to insane numbers.

Secondly, this goes **completely** against the design philosophy of 5e to have as few floating modifiers as possible.

>Recycled Destruction

Damn. 40 temporary HP for the cost of **half** of a level 1 spell? Mkay.

>Parry

Why can't you parry a piercing attack? Also, nice battle master feature.

>Bravery

There are no saving throws against surprised condition in 5e.

>Warrior

There are no ""skill rolls"" in 5e. There are ability checks.

When are you activating this? As what action?

>Seal Of Keeping

I've read this like 4 times and I still have no idea what this is supposed to do. Is this like a bag of holding..? That you can't move?

>Smite

All people on the planet with sufficient limbs can punch and kick already. Do you mean that your unarmed attack damage increases to 1d8+2+STR? If so, the ""2"" is totally useless and your class shouldn't be a better monk than the monk.

Also, you're a better Fighter than the Fighter, since normally even fighters can't add such a decent dice to their damage.

>Chosen Weapon

Fuck hexblades, right?

>Godly Fortitude

Bad wording.

>Phasing

So is it no cost or is it 300 points? Bad wording, again.

Also, infinite Phasing is insane at **level 4??** Even Druids with their Investiture of Stone can't phase infinitely to walk through a mountain.

>Rock Wall

You didn't specify an AC, so I'm going to assume to use the PHB AC for Stone Objects, which is 17. So this is a stronger Wall of Stone. Cool.

>Soldier of Stone

Lol, at level 2 you can get an AC18, HP50 summon that doesn't force you to Concentrate, can't be Dispelled? 

>Overwhelming

Lol, another static bonus to attack that stacks with everything else? As a bonus action, no less? And something that rivals **a Channel Divinity (War)** feature? Come on, man.

>Paralysis

You ***what***? A level 4 feature that allows you to restrain and remove the action **AND** give stackable exhaustions ***with saves made at a DISADVANTAGE??????*** AND you can then have several creatures be affected, at the price of almost nothing?

Of all the things you've made, this is arguably the most broken.

Not only do you need to track *constantly changing numbers* and compare them to *other* numbers, but it also doesn't add anything to the item. Just do it as I suggested. Have it be a defensive bubble. Boosting the power of the other features also helps things.

>""don't make it too powerful, tone it down""

Yet you made the original feature (Energy Shield) significantly more powerful than I thought originally. Just buff up everything, and make everything simpler, instead of making super long and super complex items that nobody wants to use.

Also, you're making a **legendary** item. Those are inherently too powerful. That's the entire point!

>wouldnt granting Advantage on the save be better?

Define ""better""? If you're are targeted with Flaming Hands? Yeah, it'd be better to have advantage for 1 charge. If you're targeted with Meteor Swarm? I'd rather pump every single bit I have into surviving that.

Another thing I didn't think about is specifying WHEN you apply that bonus - before or after the roll.

>You're suggesting to remove the charge restriction and just all out be immune to magic missile?

Yes. Complete immunity to Magic Missile while the shield barrier is up. 

It's not even that crazy for a legendary. As a matter of fact, your original wording is **really shit** for a legendary.

Take a look at this ***uncommon*** item - Brooch of Shielding: ""*While wearing this brooch, you have resistance to force damage, and you have immunity to damage from the magic missile spell.*""

Compare it to yours, which only gives you resistance to Force when you don't use too many charges, and only gives immunity to magic missile if nobody targets you with anything else, essentially.

>could you look at the additional features posted in the post itself and provide me with feedback on that as well?

Sure.

>Overcharge

Again, just a bunch of confusion. Just say the beads can now hold up to 20 charges, as the beads turn red after all of them turned blue. You're making an **artifact**. Artifacts are supposed to be the kinds of items you could have *wars* made over. Everyone on the planet wants to have their hands on it. You can make it as ridiculously overpowered as you want, because artifacts aren't meant to be used in-game for a prolonged period of time.

>Exalted state

Depends on your setting, kinda. Maybe after you bathe the bracelet in the river Styx and the rivers of Mount Celestia? Just an idea.

>The best defense is a good offense

A weapon attack? Huh. Weird choice. So you use your strength to just whallop someone over the head with it?

>may use any attack modifier your class allows you to use

Very very bad wording. Say that you may use Strength or Dexterity. Or, better yet, say that it's a DEX save with a certain DC (i.e. 20).

Finally, consuming all of your defensive stacks to make a 15d8 attack really isn't worth it. It's a defensive artifact. Use it defensively. This is bad. Not good.

If you want an Exalted Artifact bonus - say that you can use 10 charges and extend a barrier around you in a 30-ft radius sphere. All of your allies within the bubble gain +5 AC, are immune to Force and Psychic damage, immune to damage made by the magic missile spell, and no missile can pass through the barrier."
9,"CR is only used for very loose scaling. 5 CR2 Intellect Devourers can legitimately kill at least one person in a 4-person level 20 Party. I've seen it happen before.

CR of 1 means that a single creature of that CR will be a ""Normal"" challenge for a 4 player level 1 party. Normal means that it's gonna be pretty easy, because you have to have 6-7 encounters like that mixed up with some ""Hard"" ones during an adventuring day.

**Alternatively,** and if you don't want to run a very combat-heaavy game, you can instead **run few deadly encounters**. I don't suggest doing it at level 1, because your party will most likely be totally murdered, but starting from level ~3 you can throw like 2-3 deadly encounters per day at them. That way they will spend all of their resources early to survive these powerful foes.

Use Kobold Fight Club to make a loose scaling of what sort of encounter would be Easy/Normal/Hard/Deadly."
9,"I like the Incomprehensible Genius trope. Aka a villain that does something vile and evil, but his solution is *the lesser* of other evils.

9,"First of all, **formatting.**

Secondly:

>I feel that there aren't enough conjuration spells that summon creatures

Aren't there? I think nearly every spell level (aside from the high ones) has at least one spell that conjures a creature. 

>Bee

A disadvantage on ***all*** attack rolls because of a *bee?* I-... I don't think that sounds right. Especially against creatures with Frightening Auras and whatnot.

>Summon small beast

9,">I'm completely new to Homebrew Item crafting

Why did you dive into the deep end with high rarity magic item crafting? Try to work your way up. Start with flavorful and fluffy common items, move on to mildly game changing uncommon items, to game altering rare items, to majorly shifting very rare items and only then end with the monumental legendary and artifact items.

Let's analyze this:

>Even though this beaded bracelet looks kind of flimsy, it has some serious magic imbued into it.

The lore is whack. Legendary items require legendary lore. Just saying that it has ""serious magic"" is kinda childish. Make it *feel* epic. Something the bards and skalds would talk about in their ancient stories and mysteries.

>While this magic item is inactive, it does nothing but look pretty.

Didn't you just say that it looks flimsy?

>blue-ish

Generally not the kind of language you want to be using in an item for a serious game, but I'm just being anal.

>codeword

It's usually refferred to as ""Command word"" in 5e.

>The codeword can be set during attunement by concentrating on the word during the process and can be changed after a long rest by spending half an hour with it

I don't think this really adds much to the item. You learn all the command words by the time you attune to it, so it doesn't change anything. You can just safe space by removing this. Same goes for the rest of this paragraph.

>Charges

The way the charges operate must be put **before** the effects that use them, not after them.

>Energy Shield

Very many words to explain an effect that can just be simpler: ""*If you are hit by an attack, the attack instead misses and one charge is consumed. Two charges are consumed if the attack would be a critical hit*"".

The bonus to AC is **literally useless**, if attacks still target the original AC without the bonus, lol.

>Shielded Allies

I'd call it something like ""*Shared Protection*"", but that's just my preference.

Specify it's the ""*shield* spell"". Also, by the nomenclature of 5e, spells are just written in *italics*. No need for """".

Finally - you're making a Legendary item. Just let it act as shield. There's no need to make this more mechanically complex when it really ain't needed.

>Blast Shield

""Dexterity* saving throw"". Capitalized ""D"".

""*You may expend 2 charges as a reaction to aid you in your survival*"" is just cheesy. Don't go into flavor descriptions when describing mechanics. Just say what it does. 

It's much better to say ""*As a reaction, when you are subjected to a Dexterity saving throw, you may add 1 + the number of charges you want to expend to the saving throw.*""

>Negate Magic

Again, no need to mention Shield, because Shield can actually be dispelled, and I assume that the barrier can not, since you didn't specify it.

Instead, just say ""*While the barrier is active, you take no damage from *magic missiles*, as long as the spell was cast using a spell slot equal to, or lower than the number of charges currently remaining in the beads.*""

And if I were you, I'd remember that I'm making a legendary item and just say ""**You take no damage from ***magic missile***"".

>If the shield has 7 or more charges, it grants the user resistance to Force, Psychic and Magical Weapon attacks

First of all, you changed the way you refer to the one who uses the item. Previously you used ""You"" (which is the correct way), now you refer to them as ""the user"" (which is not the standard way).

Secondly, you need to specify that you are resisted to that *damage*. ""If the shield has 7 or more charges, you have resistance to Force and Psychic damage, as well as damage inflicted by Magical Weapons"".

>Note

The note is useless and I'd remove it. There's no need to not have it work with a shield. If you **really** want the user to have a hand free when doing it - say that you need to hold the bracelet when using it in the first paragraph. However, I think all of that is entirely pointless in a legendary defensive item.

**Overall:** definitely pretty good mechanics for a first-timer! Some creative uses here and there. The grammar and the technical language are definitely still lacking. I suggest you look at the way WOTC wrote their official items and replicate the wordings.

Idk this is a strong 5 as is, but could be a strong 8 if you fix up the wording and grammar. Good job!"

9,">usually the big ""it just got real"" monsters were Beholders or (better yet in his opinion), a good old fashioned Lich.

- Beholders can kill a character in one action.
- Liches can kill a character in one action.
- Mind flayers can kill a character in one action.

All three are scary. Obviously, Liches are the scariest, because they can kill you instantly at range; Beholders are slightly less scary, because you can try to avoid their attacks; and Mind Flayers are slightly less scary again, because they actually need to stun you to instagib you first.

That being said, fighting three mind flayers is absolutely fucking *terrifying*, as they can mass stun you and annihilate you.

Worse yet, mind flayers keep Intellect Devourers as pets, and I have first hand seen 5 of these CR 2 creatures attack a 4 person ***Level 20*** party and actually manage to kill off the Barbarian in the party.

> I wonder if certain monsters were more popular/ highlighted in different editions or time periods?

Obviously. But the big favorites are always the same: goblins, fiends, undead, aberrations. Those four categories are pretty much always popular with the players.

Obviously, Mind Flayers and Beholders are slightly more popular than the rest, since they are very unique to D&D.

>What is/are your ""oh shit, it just got real"" monsters?

I don't think I can name just one. Rakshasa scare the shit out of me, because they can quite literally be immortal when you meet them.

Liches scare the shit out of me, because I know they can murder me in a single action, without any saves or anything.

Beholders scare the shit out of me, because I know that half of my party loses all powers while near them.

Dragons scare the shit out of me, because I saw tons of people die to their breath attacks.

Star Spawn scare the shit out of me, because I've read the Mangler's stat sheet (***six fucking attacks, all with advantage and extra damage at CR5??***).

Literally anything that can Dominate a player scares the shit out of me, because I know that not only did we lose a compatriot, but he's actually using up his precious resources to try to kill *us*, now.

WOTC have published a lot of really great and mechanically very interesting monsters over the years 5e was out. Use them."
9,">  feats

War Caster, Resilient (DEX), or, better yet, pump your DEX to 20 as soon as humanly possible, as it governs both your defense and your damage output. After that, I'd focus on Intelligence to bring it to at least ~16. After that, consider dipping into some feats. The aforementioned War Caster will ensure that your (few) spells do not fail you, while Resilient will mean you actually get to survive in melee. 

>Spells

The #1 spell for a multiclasser like that is ***Shadow Blade***. Shadow Blade is absolutely phenomenal, as it allows you to get a very powerful weapon for free, and bunch of advantages, to boot. If your GM decides to bless you with a powerful magical weapon (aka more powerful or as powerful as your shadow blade), you should instead focus on keeping up Haste on yourself with your high level spell slots, and Protection from Evil & Good with your low level spell slots.

Find Familiar is a no-brainer.

Minor Illusion, Firebolt and/or Prestidigitation are your main wizardly workhorses as far as cantrips go.

Shield & Absorb Elements are good to fall back on, since you have a bit more spell slots than an average Eldritch Knight.

That's about that, really.

>combos

Not *that* many. You'll be relying on Shadow Blade to deal solid damage all the time. If the GM does bless you with a magical weapon another very solid option is to **dual wield** your cool magical weapon with a Shadow Blade, dealing good damage all around.

Basically, go Shadow Blade if you want to slay and Protection from Good & Evil if you have to hold enemies at bay. With your very respectable AC **and** Fighter HP, you can definitely try playing that angle.

**EDIT:** Obviously all of this is irrelevant if you went Strength route. A Strength bladesinger is a total waste and there's literally no reason to pick this archetype. Going for Divination school would be way better."
9,"I have played many characters with 10 CON and it's 100% viable and possible to survive, as long as you don't play a frontliner. And hell, even as a frontliner it is possible to survive with just 10, if you go for specific class combos and playstyles."

This already isn't very viable, when you're dealing with literally mindless creatures that cannot speak. 

This is a fine character concept ***if the campaign allows for it***. In other words - *ask the GM.*

>Is it realistic that a character like this can survive for a long time or will he just die to the first row of archers the party encounters?

Depends on the campaign. In a dungeon delve - you're hella dead after a while. Unless...

>Is dumping stats in Strength, Dexterity and Consitution for one character viable?

Yes it is. However, with some ifs:

- Firstly, you need to start play as either Bard or Warlock, or, if you're okay with being a mediocre combatant, any class as long as you pick the Mountain Dwarf race. Alternatively, you can play as any race and any mage as long as you start your game as a Fighter, Paladin or Cleric.
- Secondly, you need to start as a Variant Human. With your free feat at level 1 you have to grab the **Moderately Armored** feat, if you aren't proficient in some heavier armor already through the first point.
- Use your magic to attack. Since your Charisma is 20, all Warlock and Bard cantrips will be very accurate and have very high chance of landing, dealing great damage (especially if you're a Warlock. Agonizing blast will absolutely melt faces).

And there you go. With half plate armor and a shield in hand you'll be looking at **18 AC**, which is very comfy. Even without a shield you can get 16 AC, which is respectable. 

With Plate armor, your AC immediately shoots up to 18. Remember - not meeting the Strength requirement for heavy armor **doesn't give you any disadvantages**. All it does is limit your movement speed, which Dwarves don't have an issue with in the first place.

So yeah, ***perfectly viable***, *with the right build.*"

That being said, cool little project you made here.

I again miss the point of how you'd make it seem like it was pulled out of the sky.

You'd need three whole actions to pull this off. That's 18 seconds of casting. First you make a marble in your hand, then you make it exude light, then you make a fake sky a few feet above the ground (that everyone will notice if they aren't in the **perfect** placement for you, and then you need to raise your hand up and open it revealing the marble.

That's the exact same thing as defense. You just put this here to make it seem bigger than it is.

> and be accurate

That's the exact same thing as attack. You just put this here to make it seem bigger than it is. Seeing right through your tricks.

And no, unlike Pathfinder, Dexterity really isn't **needed** to be accurate. Mages are perfectly fine focusing on their spellcasting mod, and martials can deal with Strength, too. Unless you are a Monk. Then you're kind of forced to go DEX. Every other martial (yes, including Rogue) can be very effective with STR as their primary.

>it bottlenecks how people could play a character. 

It does not. There are plenty of very powerful characters who dump dexterity and still are totally awesomely powerful. Shield Master Fighters, Paladins with greatswords, Barbarians in half-plate armor and two cleavers and other fun builds like that.

Sure, DEX is something you usually want to have at around ~14. But there's really no point in going further with it.

Another thing to consider is that **being strong is REALLY useful in a medieval fantasy universe**. With an Adamantine battering ram you can literally tear down walls, break down doors with ease (Rrakkma allows you to autosucceed on breaking some items as long as your Strength is high enough, so this is an actual thing you can do in D&D), bend metal bars, drop heavy shit on enemies for tons of damage and other fun additional effects.

Improvised effects can be very powerful. For example, a barbarian normally can't Restrain people through class features. However, you can tip a heavy armoire on top of someone, to restrain them underneath. Or throw a large enemy corpse on some small enemies to trap them underneath. Or knock enemies about. Nothing says you can't **literally throw** lighter enemies, too.

>I want to propose to my DnD group in the next campaign is to go by these rules.

This is not required in the slightest and a misjudgement of the system.

>Dex is only To-Hit and Dodging in terms of rolls.

What is ""dodging""? Dex saves?

I don't see why you need to nerf Rogues and Fencer Fighters like this.

>Int replaces Str on Finesse weapons.

Yeah nah, fam.

>And Heavy Weapons use Str for both to-hit and damage.

No.

>how to make Acrobatics and Nature more meaningful in the game

- Acrobatics are already meaningful. Escaping grapples.
- Nature is already meaningful. Let the players roll to discern poisonous plants, beast abilities and resistances and weather effects.

9,">using a combination of Light and Presti/Minor Illusion

Minor Illusions can't move and Light has to be cast on an actual object. Prestidigitation is loud and requires you to visibly and audibly cast a spell, so unless you also cast both spells with the Subtle metamagic, it won't be too effective. People will just see a glowing marble appear in your outstretched hand. Which, granted, is *pretty cool*, but it's not like it's particularly powerful-looking.

1) D&D isn't balanced for PVP.

2) Why do you PVP in D&D at all, let alone at session 0, which is supposed to be a bonding experience?

3) Low level play is notoriously deadly. At level 1, a wizard can down the fighter in a single spell cast. However ***a goblin can OVERKILL the wizard with a single arrow***, meaning she wouldn't even get knocked unconscious - just instant death.

>How should I handle this situation as a new DM?

Don't have players fight each other and keep playing. She's not overpowered in the slightest. If you feel like being a wizard is too easy - throw some other mages at the party that could Counterspell her and Dispel her magic.

9,">assault on an enemy fortress which is functionally going to be a megadungeon

Is a single fortress really a megadungeon? Sounds like a normal dungeon to me.

>each of these wings can be handled in one adventuring day ... it's only going to take them about 24 hours to complete the dungeon

I'm confused. How can it take them 24 hours to complete a dungeon if it takes them 24 hours (approx) to complete a single wing (which, by the way, I have no idea how that works, or why causing a ruckus in Wing 1 won't alarm people in Wing 2 and 3).

>However, from a storyteller's perspective, it ruins the fast-paced assault sort of feel that I want the adventure to have.

The feel is totally warped. You want the party to beat six increasingly powerful bosses, in addition to all the other trash mobs, puzzles and traps in the fortress. It's **completely** unrealistic as you currently put it.

>Solutions

1) Change the dungeon design. Reduce the enemy count, and have there be 1 boss. Basically, make the entire dungeon finish-able in a single adventuring day.

2) Change the dungeon's lore. Not only would this explain why there are no reinforcements from the other wings, but also explain how they have time to rest. Say that each door is sealed with an arcane spell that takes 24 hours to remove and there's a mcguffin mechanism that does precisely that. This solution is the best, but it might also not be available depending on what the actual big bad is, or what you've already told your players.

3) Set up an Altar of Rejuvenation or whatever in the main hub lobby. The altar has a slot on it somewhere. Each ""miniboss"" has a token that, when inserted, immediately gives everyone the benefits of a long rest. If the party is having too easy a time, you could reduce the number of these tokens. Maybe it's an altar of a deity that the big bad is praying to, or whatever."

- Can be something as exotic and extreme as a hive of cranium rats lead by a rat named Voice-Of-Many have settled down underneath a village, making everyone act slightly funny.

Again, really doesn't. The only interesting feat it allows you to accomplish that is otherwise impossible is to use all of your attacks with a ranged weapon, and then also kicking someone in the balls as a bonus action.

It would have been way better if:

- It gave you some kind of an aikido bonus to grappling/throwing enemies
- It allowed you to sneak attack using your unarmed attacks (essentially making the fantasy of choking people out more possible)

Hell, it's not even the most creative Monk feature. Ki is so much better. That ""double jump"" step of the wind can be quite creative.

But no, if we're talking about the most creative feature, at first I thought about the *Druid's Wildshape*, but then thought better:

Dungeon of the Mad Mage has a different issue. Simply put: ***wotc failed to write an actual story***.

The book doesn't give you a concentrated answer on what's actually going on around the dungeon.

So, the GM needs to read the entire book and basically create a plot thread that makes the module **feel like an actual adventure**, not just some random dungeoneering. The Dungeon has tons of character, which makes it very easy to wow the players, but makes it hard to make cohesive.

So yeah:

You can't put Mother Theresa (neutral good) in the same alignment as a criminal who willingly hurts people, except for a specific vertical slice of the population.

>He can’t really be lawful in any sense, simply because he won’t follow the law to accomplish his mission

Being lawful has **nothing** to do with following laws. A Lawful Good paladin of Ilmater releases slaves in a country where slavery is legal - he doesn't become Chaotic. He's still very much a Lawful character, because whether you're lawful or chaotic gauges how closely you follow your **moral code**, not the laws of the land.

>I meant I don’t think he would classify as neutral good or neutral evil.

If you're talking about Red Hood, judging by your description he's a perfect example of True Neutral. He's not particularly lawful, yet he still follows some kind of a code (not Lawful nor Chaotic). He's not a criminal with morals, yet a criminal nonetheless (not Good nor Evil)."

>you would also get to constantly mess with people via Thaumaturgy.

Thaumaturgy is cool, but it's just a trick:

- Your voice can already be amplified using technology
- We basically do not use open flames often anymore, aside from a stove
- The small tremors in the ground can already be made through other features, and unlike the Cleric, the Druid can do so silently by conjuring up a bunch of animals who just rhythmically bash the ground, while the cleric needs to **loudly cast an incantation**, which removes a lot of the fun (you're not a sorcerer with Subtle metamagic, after all)
- The instantaneous sound is probably the coolest part, but you can already do that yourself. Cast Invisibility, turn into a raven, then use the mimicry feature to create any sound you like. And unlike the beta cleric, the alpha druid can **actually** make thunder by striking the ground with lightning
- Making doors fly shut or open is something you can do with the Gust cantrip already
- Altering the appearance of your eyes can also be done with technology (contact lenses)

So yeah nah. Thaumaturgy blows.

Well, yes, but you can't force them to tell you the truth you want. First of all, they can resist your magical forces. Second of all, they can then be as avoiding as they wish. 

Meanwhile the Druid can be the most intimidating motherfucker around, as he makes a bear hold you down and drip saliva on your face, start torturing you with heat metal and other fun ways to make people say the truth.

This is the most baller thing, for sure, as it'd allow you to talk to a lot of famous dead people and ask them things. However, it is massively held back by the fact that...

>which would let you make bank as a high-priced attorney

...the answers are ""brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer"". So that could be literally quite useless. And wouldn't work too well in court, many times.

Yes! It's reflecting the human spirit of adaptability.

It's easier for a high elf to become a great wizard than for a human (higher INT bonus, spell slots recharge twice as fast), for example.

>To the same degree that nothing in D&D is ever just mechanical.

I mean, sure, they can. But that's *variant* humans we're talking about. Most people are just normal humans.

>Why?

Because it's not too strong, since other races get situationally even better bonuses (i.e. the fact that elves can fully rest in 4 hours has saved my ass more times than I could count). 

It's also not just mechanical, because you can tie a story to how you became a ritual caster and created your own spellbook. Or who trained you to fight with a polearm so well. Or what sort of grueling training you underwent to become Tough. Or what sort of an event taught you how to speak to animals, or curse people. Or etc. etc. etc.

You'd need to use your action to Ready a Bonus Action quickened booming blade, when the enemy is within reach, in what is probably the only allowed usage of a readied bonus action (since it all plays out on your turn). Then use your action to drag the enemy towards you using lightning lure, then use your *reaction* to use your bonus action to cast a quickened Booming Blade. 

Frankly I have no idea if this is within the rules. It's definitely not RAI, but I wonder if it's within RAW.

>how much a hawk trained to carry someone and fly around as they fight would cost?

Well, you'd need a Giant Hawk for this. A normal hawk would never be able to carry you around. They can lift 37 pounds, but they'd be massively encumbered by that point, letting it move only 5 feet per round.

Training-wise, **entirely up to the GM**. One could argue that you couldn't teach them that in the first place, because you are way too heavy and the hawk wouldn't want to break its claws trying to lift you up. Could be anywhere from 0 gp to 100 gp, I'd reckon."

>Weapon Wall

I don't think a cleaver should be getting Evasion. Seems entirely out of place.

>Forceful Strike

A free advantage on all following attacks for a fighter is really strong. You shouldn't be able to do this as much as you want. Should have a limiter to X times per rest.

>Reach of Titans

A weapon can't have the reach of 10 without the Reach property.

>As One

An AC bonus is, again, entirely out of place here, especially since wielding an oversized weapon is, well, awkward. Doesn't make much sense.

>Tireless 

Useless.

>Crash of Titans

There are no acrobatics saving throws or athletics saving throws. You can have ability saving throws, not skill saving throws. Say that the creatures should succeed on a Dexterity saving throw and specify the DC.

>Defensive Stance

Cute but, again, makes no sense here. You're using a huge fuckoff greatsword. How would this help you defend yourself? If anything it'd be even more awkward.

That's not how it works in 5e. 5e doesn't have any situational bonuses or negative bonuses. There is advantage and disadvantage.

If you wish to avoid the awkward control over the player actions, you can instead begin by describing them sitting and a campfire. No need to describe how they made one.

Pause. Got a problem here.

First of all, you have made the **perfect** setup for the introduction of the characters. 

1) Describe the location slightly better. More details on the location, and the general topography.

2) **Ask your players to introduce themselves here**, one after the other (clockwise or whatever) and maybe say or do one minor thing to get things rolling. So each player takes a few minutes to introduce their character, describe how they look, what they are doing at the campfire, and what sort of a person they are.

This will ***immensely*** help with the roleplaying further down the line and make the game feel more natural and real.

After that is done, and the players finish their banter, ***then*** drop the ""snapping twigs"" and whatnot on them.

> Upon inspecting him

Doom is an action shooter about killing, like 12 enemy types accross all games. It focuses on combat and slightly on exploration.

9,"> you're talking about specific things, and I want it to be a overall rule

What specific things? You can include hard hitting enemies into ***literally*** any adventure. No exceptions. I don't understand what's the point here.

Knock players out. Finish them off. There - you get dead players. Enemies know about resurrection magic and healing magic, too, and they aren't leaving people to be easily brough back into fighting shape.

>and that's my fault for not saying) my adventures don't get past lvl 10 or at max 15, so most of the spells you said aren't that valid

Level 10 is enough to throw cone of cold and disintegrate at your players. The only things that wouldn't be applicable are level 9 spel- *oh wait*. Yes they are. >!Just look at how Tomb of Annihilation throws a lich with a legendary weapon at your level ~12 party.!<

>then again i want lethality in every corner, not just in the hands of crits and high level spellcasters.

Firstly - then kill them. Focus on the weaker, less armored players. Scorch them, shoot them, kill them. Once they're down, finish them off. There - you have yourself a deadly game. **There, I just solved your problem**.

Secondly - you're playing a ***heroic fantasy game***. Making the game deadly would mean changing its entire purpose. D&D isn't meant to be a grimdark horror game. There are other, more lethal games for that.

>It is not going to nerf healing

It absolutely will. Here's the rub - you can't outheal enemy damage in 5e. This isn't 3e. Most of the healing is done from 0 HP to low HP, and when resting. The only build that can *kinda* try to outheal enemy damage is a Life Domain cleric who burns all of their slots to heal, nerfing their damage.

By letting players die when they hit 0 HP - you're making healing less powerful, because now everyone who wants to be a healer needs to be a Life Domain cleric, whereas previously a Celestial Warlock or a Dreams Druid would suffice.

>you'll need to manage your health better or else you will die

You can't ""manage your health"" in a system based purely on luck. If the dice are against you - you will die.

>I don't use the enemy lores in game since I'm not playing on the forgotten realms scenario

So hold up. Stay with me here. You want to make a **lethal** game... Yet **not** include any **lethal enemies** in it? What? O-okay?

And if you do want to include them - then what's the issue? Enemies want to kill the party. They will try to finish them off. What's wrong or exotic about that?

> i came here searching for homebrews and different rules to use

And I'm telling you that **you do not need homebrew to solve your problems**. What you need to is to learn the existing system better.

>getting chewed by a dragon might not give you a second chance

Yeah, it might not. But then again, it might. Hence the death saves.

>I'm going for a logic here

You're applying logic to a fantasy game with magic about heroes. Logic will not be applied to other, deadlier games, such as Dark Heresy and Call of Ctulhu, too.

You're applying logic to a game of dice. Come on, my guy. ***Expand your imagination***. You're too rigid. Live a little.

> I want people to get hit and die

That's not how 5e's HP works. You might not even be getting hit until you hit 0 HP. You should, again, read up on the rules.

But either case, listen, if you just want to be that anal GM that just annihilates the party and punishes every player who is dumb enough not to create a ranged character - that's fine by me. Set the players at level 1, boost enemy numbers, increase enemy CR and kill your players. Kill them all. Kill them every session every time. After all - a single hit with a weapon should be able to kill, right?

>you're living a dangerous life and a slip is fatal

Yes. That same thing happens in 5e. A slip is fatal. You fall unconscious, enemy approaches you and smacks you twice with an axe. There, you're dead now. What is the problem? You can **reliably** be killing 1 party member per encounter, even with basic 5e rules, because every hit on an unconscious target within 5 feet of them counts as a critical. And when you're making death saves and get hit by a critical attack - that counts as *two failures*. 

> that greatsword to the gut will kill you 90% of the time

Okay? So you ***don't want the players to feel like heroes***, right?

That's cool by me. **Here's a homebrew for you:**

The first enemies bearing great weapons start appearing in CR ~3. So throw CR 3 enemies at level 1 players. When the players hit 0 HP, don't have them roll death saves. Tell that player to roll a **1d10**.

On a 1 - he falls unconscious and starts making death saves.

On a 2-10 - he immediately dies.

There, enjoy. Make sure to ask your players if they're going to enjoy that too, by the way.

>I'm talking about a sprinkle of logic in your battles

There is no logic in a game based on dice and heroic and monster levels. A level 20 hero ***doesn't have more blood***. A level 20 hero is just as vulnerable as a level 1 hero. The difference is that their mastery, their skill at blocking/avoiding/parrying/dodging attacks has reached supernatural levels.

A level 1 fighter can barely block one arrow before he is overwhelmed and killed by the second one.

A level 20 fighter can be bashing arrows out of mid air, blocking them efficiently with his shield, weaving around so they miss etc. And then, finally, after the Fighter is fatigued and tired (low HP), a lucky shot eventually goes past his defense and strikes him.

The heroic fighter then falls down and clutches for his life. Sometimes the gods smile upon him, and let the warm embrace of unconsciousness take him, as his body slowly recovers. Other times, the gods are fickle and reap his soul to the afterlife.

There. That's logical in this game.

>I'm talking about a sprinkle of logic in your battles to make you scared about them and without being unfair.

You can have that in 5e. Throw a beholder at a level 10 party. It's a hard encounter, to be sure. However, that beholder can totally annihilate the party. Very likely will kill the mage. The beholder shoots a disintegration stalk at the wizard, who fails his death save, and dies immediately.

There, you just killed someone fully within the rules, in a fair and scary fight."

I do wonder what she'd say about it. I imagine she'd think that it's important for them to be represented, too, because..

Here's the thing. She supports ""LGBTQA**+**"". Now that ""+"" is rather tricky. Some folk consider that it means ""LGBTTTQQIAA"", which is to say, mostly gender and sexuality stuff.

However, other folk consider that the ""+"" means so much more than that, from otherkin, to pedophiles ([yes, really](https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/pedophiles-put-themselves-under-the-lgbt-umbrella-in-rebranding-effort)).

Now if we count Otherkin, then yes, for sure, orc representation is important. As is dragon representation, angel representation, demon representation, every single animal representation and anything inbetween.

P.S. Always found it funny how most otherkin are ""angels"" and ""dragons"" and ""wolves"", but none of them are like ""*corpse maggot-kin*"" or ""*botfly-kin*""."

9,">you can't outright die

Of course you can. If you're a total weak nerd, like a Wizard, a good solid crit by an enemy that deals a ton of damage with a single hit can definitely kill you. RIP that one Wizard that was at 5 HP after being healed by Healing Word and then got gored by a Mammoth's 8d8+7 crit.

That's also ignoring that spells/abilities that deal a metric fuckton of damage (meteor swarm, cone of cold etc.), spells that full on kill you once they reduce you to 0 HP (disintegrate) or spells that straight up kill you (Power Word Kill).

>I could remove that rule completely, and make 0 be straight death and that would make lower levels too hard

Bad idea. D&D is supposed to be a heroic adventure game, and the meta of healing is supposed to treat people.

>To be perfectly honest I'm not a great fan of the ""bleed out"" mechanic because most of the times it makes no sense, being impaled by a sword but still being alive and even being able to stabilize yourself via saves 

Did you ever get stabbed in a dark alleyway? I assume not. However, if you get stabbed, and don't take out the knife or whatever that's inside of you, there is a small chance that you will survive, as blood clots around the wound and keeps you *alive enough* for a while, until someone heals you, or until your heroic spirit allows you to regain enough strength to get to 1 HP and take it out, staunching the bleeding.

>and don't bother to bring the ""your monsters can simply attack the useless piece of meat on the ground instead of trying to defend itself from the arrows, spells and blades"" for that makes no sense 90% of the time (at least for me).

There are monsters that specifically target weak and dying targets. Devils come to mind, according to 3e lore.

>what variants and/or homebrews you guys use (or would use) to correct those points and to bring a more lethal aspect to the game

You raise up from 0 HP - you get an exhaustion point. Simple. Elegant. Gets the point across.

Also, ***learn the system***. Judging by the fact that you said that ""you can't die when you have a lot of HP"", it hints me that you don't know the system well-enough to know about how *actually* deadly it is."

>he'll also not be able to use a lot of magic items

10,"when youre reviving a zealot barb you dont need to provide the material components. if you were to twin cast it on someone else dead nearby, would they also get revived for free?

can resurrection spells even be twinned because dead creatures technically arent creatures? or would you just need the material components for the non-zealot target? if there is no zealot in the equation would you just need the material component for one casting or both creatures?"
10,"in my setting, the capital of the dwarven kingdom, Kaas Kanker, is famous for making golems (including the warforged, airships, and even an electric railroad system. basically its like a mini eberron), but i dont want it to feel like its just a regular city with golems/constructs tacked on as an after thought. what are some cool ideas i can put in this city to make it *really* fell like *The* City of Golems

should i just rip off more from eberron's cities? or maybe have it be like the Jetsons, but replace all robots with constructs and elementals? if i go with the latter, any ideas on how to do it without going *too* far into sci-fi territory?

***EDIT:*** also, the royal family made a deal with a silver dragon centuries ago so dragon magic is also pretty common with that family and those who have close ties to them"
10,"ive seen a couple of people talk about letting EK take spells from a different class list than wizard and i thought itd be cool to come up with different names for EK and AT if they were to do that. so far i could only think of one for EK, Crusader or Divine Knight for picking the cleric spell list, but im stumped for the rest of the spell lists and AT entirely

anyone got any ideas for what they might be called?"
10,"yes, thats two skills. you just pick different ones for your rogue class. you can also just pick any 2 skills of youre choice from your background since the premade ones in the book are just suggestions and it even tells you up front that you can mix and match pieces of other baclgrounds to fit your character. keep in mind you only get one background though, so you cant be a criminal urchin rogue and get all of those skills for free"
10,"yes, background skills are in addition to any others yo may get from your class, race, etc."
10,"obviously you can't pick all of them, but any of them can have a lot more use than scorching ray. you should pick your spells carefully and pick ones the emphasize whatever role you're looking to fill in the game and get use throughout as many levels as possible"
10,"invisibility, hold person (combined with action surge), mirror image and blur are way better than scorching ray. the last two combined with shield can make you really tanky"
10,"maybe grab magic initiate (wizard) for find familiar so you can cast cure wounds from a range. or the inspiring leader feat if you have at least decent CHA

as for the lack of rogue, don't feel like you need to fill ""roles"" like an MMO. besides, you can already sneak around with wild shape when needed since you're not a moon druid"
10,"the knight variant for the noble background gives you a few NPCs that follow you around, one of which is a squire. all of them use the commoner stats and will not fight or follow you into immediately dangerous places (i.e. dungeons) so they're almost entirely they're for RP"
10,"no, it specifically says ""As an action, ***YOU*** (the one who cast the spell) can dismiss your familiar..."" if the familiar could dismiss themselves, it'd say so"
10,"first off, AC formulae don't stack, you pick one or the other. second, monks don't even get light armor prof so you couldn't even be able to utilize the darkwood core proficiency bonus"
10,your monk AC and warforged AC dont stack

10,"yeah, an instakill spell with no saves, attack rolls, or anything like that *is* very useful. thats why its allocated to the 9th level spell power word kill"
10,you should be talking to your DM about this
10,"i assumed 5e, so idk how any of this works in 3.5e"
10,"not really. create/destroy water and create food & water require the water to appear either on the ground or in contained (creatures are NOT containers!). on top of that, youll need some means of preventing a creature from just moving out of the water AND youll need to prevent them from moving for a few minutes as suffocating in 5e takes a a lot longer than most combats tend to go"

10,"yes, there's nothing saying they don't"
10,"if that doesn't work, maybe a broom of flying or a flying carpet later on"
10,"just get a pair of winged boots, theyre only an uncommon magic item"
10,"no, you'll need to dedicate at least 13 levels into wizard or sorcerer to get it. there might be a magic item that you can attune to, but im not certain"
10,"im a little confused. other than everyone wanting to stay at their current level, whats stopping everyone from just voting to level up and skip straight to the higher levels?

id say just use milestone instead of this"
10,no
10,"youre better off just adjusting your perspective on what a ""hit"" is rather than make up some whole mechanic thatll change a lot of things in combat. either that or finding a different system in which armor reduces damage instead of determining a hit from a miss. yeah, its easier to make contact with someone wearing heavy plate armor, but its hard to *hit* (i.e. harm) them. a ""miss"" against heavy armor will usually involve the weapon glancing away or an arrow bouncing off"
10,its up to your DM

yes, thats the entire point of the feat"
10,"yes, use common sense over strict adherence to RAW. wolves can certainly drag someone/thing away, how else would they take food back to their dens?"
10,maybe it's like a pearl of power. as an action you can activate the item and regain one spent use of rage. it can only be used once per day
10,"you can always make a magic item for that, but resource management is just part of the game. they're *supposed* to be careful with their rages, using them on more important fights"
10,"1. the spell will tell you what kind of creature it creates/animates

2. they do whatever you command them to do

3. depends on the stay block

4. ask your DM

5. no you just need to be within 60ft to issue the command

6. ask your DM"
10,"just let them put their stats wherever they want and be whatever race/class they want. if you force them to play a character they don't like, they're gonna have a lot less fun and probably just play reckless/suicidal so they can roll up a new character"
10,"choking someone out tends to take way longer than most combats last in 5e. im pretty sure that was intentional, otherwise spells like Sleep that knock creatures unconscious would be a lot less useful than they already are. if a player wants to put someone into a choke hold to knock them out, they should need to maintain a grapple (with both hands) until the target has fully suffocated and dropped to 0. if its out of combat and the target was caught completely defenseless, then youre free to make like one or two checks rather than a few minutes' worth of athletics checks, but during combat i everyone is more alert so it shouldnt be as easy to knock them out outside of losing hp"
10,"if they have access to fire, they could totally take on 2 trolls. maybe even 2 trolls and their pet crocodile"
10,you could go battle master fighter or hunter ranger assuming your DM lets firearms count as martial weapons

10,"theyre spectral, meaning they do not occupy a 5ft square like physical creatures do. and im pretty sure you can dismiss them like a familiar"
10,"id say smith tools. you could use like metal bolts or staples to jury rig your undead together and repair them or even make new equipment for them. if you wanna get really into the upgrading part, you could take a 2-3 lvl dip into forge cleric to be able to quickly forge weapons and armor for them

***EDIT:*** if you do go forge cleric, maybe pick leatherworker's tools or weaver's tools for your warforged tools"
10,"they usually get class features that give them either more damage or more avenues for damage. nearly every martial class also gets Extra Attack at lvl 5 (or 6 if theyre a hybrid subclass like sword bard or bladesinger wizard)

the weapons in 5e can be found on page 149 of the PHB"
10,"i think its fine as is. the main thing it really does is just let you cast your highest available spells more often earlier on. if you want to balance things out, just make your encounters a bit tougher and dont let the party take a short rest after each fight

if youre worried about martials falling behind more, then just put a few more magic weapons into the game than you would with a vanilla game"
10,you really just need a table big enough for everyone playing to (comfortably) sit. if the room can fit the table without taking up all of the walking space then that's plenty. having a little extra room near the table for a shelf and/or drawers is about the most the average group might need
10,"some semi-sentient, severed limbs from the same troll"
10,">  resistances don’t work either

if youre raging you take half damage because falling damage is bludgeoning damage. it does technically ignore nonmagical resistance since its not an ""attack"", but rage doesnt care if the source is magical or not"
10,depends on what the result of the 20d6 and how much hp they have
10,i think thats what theyre talking about. theyre asking how a wild mage/wild soul multiclass would work out
10,"hes asking from a player perspective, not a DM one"
10,have your own counterspell or have spells with more than 60ft range or you/your allies do some effects that prevent creatures from taking reactions (like shocking grasp for example). you can also hex a caster and impose disadvantage on their spellcasting ability so if they need to roll itll have a higher chance of failure
10,"itd be chaotic for sure, but not a lot of synergy since wild magic procs when you cast a spell and you cant do that while raging"
10,r/lfg
10,"your slot progression is separate for both classes, but you can cast warlock spells with bard slots and vice versa. page 164-165 in the PHB explains all of this stuff"
10,it just cares about the possessions of whoever drew the card. id say that business would just lose 1/6 of its value or whatever
10,you could go hexblade/swords bard so you can do all of your blade flourishing stuff without having DEX be your top priority. or you could go GOO tomelock/lore bard to just get a ton of extra spells and cantrips
10,"1. no, they can do any kind of action on their turn as long as that action does not involve making an attack roll of any kind

2. yes"
10,">You never long rest

unless you go warforged, you need to make a CON save every 24 hours that you dont take a long rest or take exhaustion. you dont need to sleep with this build, but you still need your rest, and taking 8 1 hour long breaks isnt good enough"
10,you...swing it? it's still a melee weapon
10,"unless youre buying from like ultra-precise engineering companies, every die you get is gonna have *some* bias, even with balance tests like the salt water test. most of the time, though, those biases are minuscule at best and will almost certainly not impact the game at all"
10,"my 2nd grade english teacher just told us stalacTITES are ""held up TIGHT on the ceiling"". she didnt have a special phrase for MITES though"
10,"at least in 5e, I've never heard of any potion requiring concentration. they just last as long as they say they do. if one did say it requires concentration, then it works like regular concentration works"
10,"id say all of those would cause the caster to not be affected, but the familiar would be affected in \#1 and \#2"
10,"the game already has this sort of thing by default, its not explicitly written in the books, but this sort of thing has been reverse engineered before. its not an exact science, but i think the base damage die for a martial weapon is 1d8 or 1d10. then you lower or increase the die size for each perk or penalty respectively. so for the rapier, you start with 1d10, but it has finesse so you bump it down to 1d8. halberd starts with 1d10, you add on reach which would drop it to 1d8, but then Heavy and Two-handed bring it back up to 1d10"
10,"no, you still learn spells from each class separately, even though you share the same spell list. you still get the slots, though, but not the actual spells"
10,"roll20 does that. and even if you dont want the character sheet option, its there if you change your mind, otherwise you can just ignore it. and some features are even integrated with the character sheets so you can see how someone got a certain modifier for an attack for example"
10,"in the scenario in the OP, they just say that theyre immune to blindness. and going strictly by RAW, the tarrasque's stat block just says ""While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover, blah blah blah..."" it just says you get the blinded condition, it doesnt say ""the inside of the tarrasque's belly is darkness"", so it doesnt care about darkvision or available light sources"
10,"i guess technically yes, but i dont think itd make a ton of sense given the intent of that feature"
10,"both spells take an action to cast. you only get one action each round. even if you did have multiple actions (like as a fighter with action surge), the spells do ***exactly*** what they say they do. if Message  interacted with spells like VM or bardic inspiration, then itd say so"
10,"well, a lot of dragons can just polymorph themselves into different forms (at least in typical settings. if your dragons are more animal/feral then they might not have access to magic like that) so it isnt too difficult for them to find someone to mate with"
10,"one main tip i can give is dont get too cocky with your AC. youre a wizard first and foremost, so dont expect to have the same survivability as Fighter just because your AC is similar to theirs

if youre wanting to multiclass 2-3 levels of fighter should be all you need. dont go more than 4 though since you already get extra attack at wiz 6 and youll give up 9th level spells if you go beyond 3 fighter"
10,"you could always reskin the other races rather than outright omit them from existence. dragonborn arent even directly *born* of dragons in default D&D lore, theyre just dragon adjacent, so they can just be their own separate species of a similar vein of lizardfolk. 

> Why can't elves and dragons interbreed?

dragons can breed with just about any creature, even beasts. thats what the half dragon template is for. as for dwarves & tabaxi or other sorts of combinations, you can just say that they arent genetically compatible (also, itd be a nightmare to try to balance an actual hybrid PC race for every combination out there). theres [a chart from i think 3.5e](https://img.fireden.net/tg/image/1447/13/1447134434375.png) that might help you in this department. the way ive always heard humans being justified as the ""universal sperm donors"" is that their genes are the most compatible with the other races or that human is the base and the other races build on top of that base DNA"

10,"last week my cleric/wizard hit 22 AC. base 15, wearing a shield, and the Shield spell. if i hadnt been concentrating on Dragons Breath i could have popped Shield of Faith on myself for 24, and if i kept my blessing of the forge for myself i could get 25"
10,"i mean, you can prohibit whatever you want from your games, just dont be surprised if your players take a disliking to all of it and decide not to play. what exactly is it about the races and classes that dont fit your world and why not just tweak your world so that they fit?

> I really dislike the Tolkein approach of making certain races have certain personalities and hating certain other races cause dark lord

so give each individual a different personality. just because most goblins in D&D settings are evil and selfish doesnt mean *every* goblin has to be like that, especially in your own world

>Also I feel like certain races just wouldn't fit the story that well, like the hybrids between monsters and humans

how does someone being a hybrid race not fit the story? also, remember, its not *your* story, its the group's story. dont restrict player choices because you have a predetermined story youre wanting to tell"
10,"yeah, it says ""Attacks per Action: 2"". if you took fighter up to level 11, itd say ""Attacks per Action: 3"" then at 20 itd say 4"

10,nah I know what word I meant
10,"remind them that short rests exists for a reason. if everyone is low on hp, they could very well get back up close to full hp with a short rest before you even need to use a spell to heal them

healing spells are best used to revive dying allies, not to keep them topped up like you're playing overwatch"
10,"poison is different from acid, and if this lance just does acid damage by default, it should still stack with poison. if they still get to apply the poison from their shortbow to the lance, then it can be a pretty good item"
10,"there can be, yeah. like if there's just one goblin (or some other monster that they could feasibly kill in one round) sitting there, you could just let the players make their attacks without wasting time rolling for initiative"

10,"1. sure

2. yes, a shield is not a weapon

3. yes, thats the point of the feat. you can cast it once per long rest

if youre dipping into fighter at all, you might as well for to level 2, 3, or 5 for action surge, subclass feature, and extra attack respectively depending on how much of your late game rogue youre willing to give up"
10,"its their home usually. its where they keep their stuff. and not every ""dungeon"" has to be medieval, cellar with cobblestone walls and floors ***D***ungeon, the ""dungeon"" is where the adventure takes you"
10,"that honestly sounds like a bad idea imo. unless theres magic involved, a merchant cant just force you to buy a rug because of one die roll. and if magic is involved, they shouldnt be in business very long if word ever gets out that theyre enchanting people

now if a player *wants* to buy the rug, then maybe they could make an insight check contested by the merchants deception or persuasion (depending on how genuine they are with their trade) to determine if its a good deal or not"
10,"dont feel like you need to have all 300 pages memorized. only about 1/3 of it is actual rules, the rest are character options, spells, races, etc. and even the parts that are rules arent meant to be memorized either- its a reference manual, not a textbook. just watch a few videos of people actually playing, when they do something and you arent quite how it works, look it up in the book or online. once you play or watch a few sessions, you get the hang of how the game works"
10,you still get max at level 1 so you should have 9 hp. then when you level up you can choose to roll or take the average (5+1) and add that to your max hp

10,"if you want to pick a race that'll help in terms of ASI, firbolg or bugbear would be good picks. as for subclass, I think kensei or open hand will work well with any barb"
10,"i think barb 3 or 4/monk X should be fine. you dont need to go to level 5 in barb if youre going majority monk since monk gets extra attack anyways. id start with monk until 5 or 6, take your barb levels after that, then go the rest monk. the rage bonus wont be amazing, but itll really add up when youre doing flurry of blows. 

the main kicker here is youre going to be pretty MAD since monk requires good DEX and at least decent WIS and barb relies on CON and STR too. so unless you roll really well on stats or find a belt of giant strength or ogre gauntlets, you might only have like 13 or 14 in those stats"

10,"polymorph has a verbal component, so it's very likely they'll wake up when they hear you chanting the magic words"
10,">you have to burn your free object interaction before casting somatic spells.

that's not true. it doesn't cost anything to drop an item (or in this case release your grip with one hand) and you only need to use two hands whenever you attack with the weapon. you can just hold the weapon with one hand while you perform the somatic/material components of the spell"
10,"i wouldnt outright ban any spells from the game itself. its fine for some to be illegal within certain cities, but none of the spells you listed have an outrageously high impact, at least not to the point of being worthy of being banned entirely. legend lore is just that: it gives you lore about some part of the world. if you only know some vague details about the thing in question, you just get more vague answers; if you have more details on the thing in question you get more detailed answers. create food and water wouldnt be an issue for the same reason not everyone in the world IRL is a doctor. not everyone is as devoted to a god as a cleric is nor do they have the time to practice their faith like a cleric does. speak with dead can be easily worked around for murder mysteries, just have the killer be in disguise or attack from secret. that way the victim cant just give an objective description of the killer and ruin the whole point of the mystery"

10,"its fine, but if youre okay with having 9 STR and knocking your CHA down 1 point, you can have your DEX be 17, so you will only need to put one point from your next ASI into it. you could put the other point into CON or take a feat that gives +1 DEX instead

depending on what spells you plan on picking, you might want to bump you other scores down a little more so you can get INT closer to your DEX. before racial mods, you can have 8,15,12,15,10,11 to get you 17 DEX and 16 INT"
10,"walls, yes. ceilings, probably not, at least not without needing to make STR/athletics checks"
10,"its not OP in combat at all since its concentration and you have to be very particular about how you word the suggestion, otherwise the DM could interpret it a different way than you intended

as for the dungeon scenario, yeah, a DM could do that, but theyd be a dick if *every* dungeon were like that. if a dungeon did have that sort of trap in place, the party can just cast dispel magic on the target or trap. or just hunker down for 8 hours and set up defenses"

so you can fireball, action surge, fireball again. but you can't quicken fireball then cast another fireball"

10,"even if you do go monk, again, your unarmed strike wont really help a ton since you cant use sneak attack, and by extension the assassination feature loses a lot of its kill potential. its generally not a smart idea to build your whole character around one kind of niche scenario (that might only happen like once the whole campaign). especially if that scenario wouldnt even let you utilize your subclass' primary feature (assassinate only happens if the enemy is surprised. if you have an audience with a noble, they would not be surprised in the mechanical sense when initiative is rolled)"
10,"if all you care about is the unarmed strikes, then just go full monk or go mostly monk then dip a little into rogue for expertise and sneak attack. it wont be worth it to sacrifice your rogue powers just so one racial trait (that will get outpaced really quickly) can get use"
10,"youre probably better off with dual wielding if im being honest. monk unarmed strikes dont trigger sneak attack, and unarmored defense will be forcing you to spread your ability scores a bit thinner just to compete with studded leather or magic armors"
10,"id start with monk and take it to about 6, then go the rest rogue. that way you still two subclass features, extra attack, stunning strike, and your unarmed strikes become magical"
10,"unless the devil is hiding (i.e. theyve taken the Hide action), they can still know his general location. theyd just still have disadvantage on attacks, and all ranged attacks must target a specific space to guess the location of the target. if the devil does decide to take the Hide action, they roll a stealth check, and then someone will have to take the Search action to make a perception check; if they roll higher than the devil's stealth they know where he is, if not then they have to guess his location to attack"
10,"you can really get started for free so you can decide if this hobby is one you and your family want to put money into. [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTD2RZz6mlo&). if you and your wife like it enough to keep playing, then consider getting the PHB and Monster Manual. the DMG isnt completely necessary, but if you can get it for a good price, grab it (all of the 3 core books are frequently on sale on Amazon. during the holiday season they can be around ~$20 USD)"
10,"yes they can do that. no its not a bit much because monk attacks tend to be a bit weaker than those of fighters and this is the astral self's capstone feature. its supposed to be strong. the fighter gets other features by lvl 17 like a lot more hp, better AC, higher damage weapons (and most likely a legendary magic weapon and/or armor by then), and things like battle master maneuvers to do even more damage per hit. and the fighter's action surge is much more universal than taking the attack action PLUS they still have their bonus action afterwards"
10,"a couple of minor corrections:

en masse\*, nip it in the bud*

>Can you cast a dead magic zone? Can you syphon magic from others?? How would I do this and where can I find anything on it if there is anything?

youre the DM, anything goes. NPCs arent restricted to the spell lists that PCs are so they can do whatever you want"
10,"GFB and BB are from SCAG, but are not in XGtE. absorb elements was from the elemental evil companion and was reprinted in XGtE"
10,"honestly kinda weak. the most use I see this getting is in between combats where it doesn't matter if you don't make an attack each round. other than that, this is honestly just a worse version of True Strike since all of the turns prior to you charging up could have just been used to potentially deal more damage (especially if you have extra attack or other ranger things that give even more attacks)"
10,"actually, none of the SCAG spells made it into XGtE"
10,I don't think so in terms of RAW. ask your DM
10,"the tradeoff is that spells are meant to do extra effects that just regular attacks cant do. so yeah, a fighter can attack twice per round and can have like a +9-10 to hit by your level, but their attacks cant normally impose some other conditions like guiding bolt can and their damage is split up between those attacks whereas yours is in one go. 

and as cleric, most of your spells should focus on buffing your allies, not dealing the most damage, so having your attack bonus not be the highest possible isnt a huge deal, but you should definitely spend your ASI next level on a WIS boost to get it to 20

you should also use your spells more wisely. if you find out an enemy has good AC, dont use attack spells. if they have high DEX, dont use sacred flame or other DEX saves. save them for the moments in which theyre most useful"
10,"no, you can just cast it once per long rest. you dont have a 7th, 8th, etc. level slot to spend either. you dont even technically *know* the spell, you just cast it."
10,"> I'm not 100% sure how I would go about playing them.

thats for your DM to decide. i imagine most DMs wont allow you to essentially control 2 PCs at once"
10,">it’s undead so makes sense

its not undead. its a construct. it uses transmutation magic to animate it rather than necromancy

and the reason it is immune to nonmagical and nonadamant damage is because its a golem. thats what they do. theyre magical creatures, so only magical weapons can harm them"
10,"yup i do, i watched a video on it just now"
10,"i was under the impression that short O was ""oh"", ""toe"", ""low"" and long O was ""cow"", ""how"", ""now""

***EDIT:*** lmao fuck English"
10,"its pronounced jer-ow, ~~long~~ short ""O"". same as drowned or pound. as for if its okay to call them dark elves, id say its similar to people IRL. some drow are probably fine with either while others would prefer the proper name. i imagine some africans are fine with being called ""black people"" while others prefer to be called ""africans"" or by whatever country theyre from. likewise for europeans or asians. itll vary from person to person"
10,"blessing of the forge doesnt work on magical armor (and RAW it must be a suit of armor too so you cant just put it on your shield). and shield of faith is concentration and uses spells lots, so you cant just have it on every fight for the whole fight either. so your actual, consistent AC should be 21 which isnt terribly high at all. once you hit tier-2, monsters can hit that no problem"
10,then be the DM you want to be or find one who runs the kind of game you want to play in
10,"> Not everyone is playing a homebrew

the DM can and should still modify modules because not every encounter is going to be a good fit for their group. changing a few encounters isnt ""rebuilding"" the module around a character, and saves can affect everyone, not just the high AC characters. and even if for whatever reason they do not want to make any changes at all to a premade adventure, i imagine most modules have at least some encounters that have saving throw-based enemies at some point"
10,"if you got that AC legitimately, then you shouldnt have anything to feel bad about. your DM should just remember that saving throws exist. if you have that AC because of a shit ton of magic items, thats their fault for putting them into the game, not yours"
10,"if you dont like the default lore, you/your DM can change it"
10,">"" The object can be ***a door***, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, ***or*** another object that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.""

they could have just targeted the trapdoor without seeing the lock. i mean, youre free to rule however you want, but claiming that the door isnt locked, the lock is whats locked instead, seems needlessly semantic imo. id have ruled in favor of the players. if you push a button to lock your car, you dont say ""i have locked the locks on my car doors"", you say ""i have locked my car doors"""
10,"start with season 2. once you get close to caught up, then do season 1 if you want. they're separate campaigns altogether so you won't be missing ask overarching plot between the two"
10,"the d&d gorgon is based off of some medieval bestiary of mythological creatures (ill link a pic if I find it). the gorgon in that book is more of a cow abomination than the snake creature from Greek myth

10,"you can use minor illusion to create concealment so enemies might have a harder time hitting you or an ally. and youre at the very least proficient with a sling, so youre probably better off using that instead of the shortbow"
10,"and how would these words manifest? just by moving your lips? i assumed you meant tracing the words in the air, but then the Silence spell would be completely useless if all you need to do is mouth the arcane words rather than actually speak them"
10,thats somatic which the spell already has. it wouldnt be fair for other casters (mainly sorcerers with subtle spell) if you could just substitute verbal with hand gestures
10,"yes, you have to speak some words when you cast the spell. thats why it has the Verbal component"
10,"legolas style is fine. I neither know nor care if it's realistic, but it won't ruin the game if you do it"
10,"even if it does get thrown up, the golem is still immune to all of the tarrasque's attacks and the golem's attacks are magical so itll ignore the tarrasque's immunities. 

what im trying to say is that if the supposed ""God Killer"" has trouble taking on a single monster thats less than 1/3 its own CR, then just one or possibly even two God Killers probably wont be able to be a major threat to what are essentially a baker's dozen+1 demigods

besides, the tarrasque honestly has a pretty boring stat block. its basically just a big sack of hit points with high damage and not a ton of interesting mechanics. its essentially a dragon without the breath weapon"
10,the tarrasque can be defeated by a solo clay golem. 14 lvl 20 PCs could almost certainly kill it in less than 3 or 4 rounds
10,"if its early in the campaign, i dont see how it can screw it all up. just retcon his character being there. yeah, it might be a little awkward for the next session or two, but you will all forget about it pretty quickly"
10,id say yeah. just still ask the DM just in case theyre a real stickler for this sort of stuff
10,"sure. at the very least you can just mark off the 10gp your background probably gave you before you play or just say ""i cast find familiar"" as soon as the game starts"
10,"if hes constantly cheating, then thats even more of a reason to not invite him anymore. even if hes ""a good guy"" outside of the game, apparently, his behavior in the game is an issue. you can still be friends and *not* play D&D together"
10,"make him make a new, non-homebrew character. or better yet dont invite him to the game anymore because he apparently cant be trusted"
10,it actually made the cut from UA and was printed on XGtE (idk if any major changes were made though)
10,"some good alternatives are spare dice, coins, bottle caps, spools of thread, or really anything else you can find that'll fit on the grid. you can even [make minis out of paper](https://youtu.be/VWWu9Ny8cW8)"
10,"seeing through the familiar uses your action each round, so it's not exactly a viable option in combat"
10,"that's not chaotic, that's just being stupid"
10,the DM too. I just ***love*** playing at tables where I can somehow deal max damage to myself when shooting a crossbow at someone else!
10,"yes you have to buy one. you dont magically get the equipment of a 1st level warlock (unless that was part of your pact)

thats for your DM to decided. RAW no, not for a warlock focus"
10,"thats a half dragon, not a dragonborn. dragonborn are their own separate race and dont even need to be directly related to a dragon"
10,its a dagger
10,a couple of CR 1 creatures or one CR 1 and a few lower CR minions should be fine for 6 PCs
10,"there is no ""best"" way, just find what suits you and your group the best. heres my method: 

4d6 drop the lowest, you can put the results in any stat you want, but if you don't have at least two 15s, you start over. also, if you don't end up with at least one score that is 9 or lower, your lowest score becomes an 8. if a score is lower than 7 you reroll that score."
10,"it will vary wildly depending on the class because 5e is not balanced around PvP. PCs are designed to have low survivability and high damage output, so this fight will either be horribly unfair for the party or just be no fun because the single enemy kills them all in one hit. youre better off taking some existing NPC stat block and adding a few class features to it rather than building an actual PC from the ground up"
10,"just let them reskin find familiar. other than that, tiny servant is the closest thing i can think of, but you cant cast spells through it or use its senses or have a telepathic bond with it or any of the cool stuff that a familiar gives"
10,"just use the swarm of ravens stat block, and assuming like 12-16 birds per swarm, 50 chickens would be about 3-4 separate swarms"
10,"artificer. the description of the class outright suggests that you reflavor your ""spells"" as various magic items or gadgets that youve made"
10,"yes theyre good. theyre meant to be a skirmisher, darting in and out of combat, being a nuisance to the enemies while the fighter or barbarian are bringing the real damage. theyre there so theres another thing for the enemies to worry about rather than just ignore the meat shield for the squishies behind you"
10,"it doesnt create a creature, so it doesnt provide cover or anything like that. its just a force that you control rather than an actual creature being summoned"
10,"the necromancer in 5e gets a feature called Command Undead. they target any undead and it makes a saving throw. depending on the undead's INT it could be permanently under your control, it makes the save with advantage, it or repeats the save every hour with advantage"
10,"it's also the DM's job to make sure everyone's having fun too. if one player mind controlling another for no reason is making the game not fun for others, then the DM can tell the mind controller no"
10,"not by default. I saw ""assassin"" and assumed you were multiclassing with assassin rogue"
10,yeah don't let them do that. I imagine it won't be any fun at all for the vamp player
10,"longsword for katana. if you want sneak attack/finesse, just ask your DM if you can use the rapier but it deals slashing damage instead of piercing

10,are you the necromancer or the DM?
10,"if they're a true vamp, theoretically yes, but you can just tell them no because that'd be a dick move"

10,"if you make any kind of melee attack (even a melee spell attack), you can choose for it to have been nonlethal. aside from just dealing damage, Sleep or Eyebite are good spells for knocking out or use Hold Person so you wont have any resistance putting restraints on the target"
10,">but I’m afraid to ask how many

10,wherever you want them to go as long as you can see it when you need to see it
10,"not every god of death has to be evil, and depending on the setting, necromancy (the animate dead and withering sort) might not even be inherently evil per se, so one can certainly use those powers with good intentions"

2. that sounds like chaotic neutral. you should probably watch some youtube videos or read the section in the PHB about alignment (page 122)"
10,"if its during combat, they still roll an attack and damage as usual, then you narrate according to how they rolled. if they somehow did enough damage to kill him, then they do just that. if not, then the pirate managed to wiggle out of the way and only got a cot across his chin or arm or whatever"
10,"if youre tired of it just leave the group. trying to get back at them in game is not only petty and childish, its basically impossible because the GM is the ultimate authority over what happens in the game. if you have an issue with the game, talk to them like a grownup instead of try to get back at them in the imaginary world"
10,"on another PC, they both just act however they want. dont force either of them to act a certain way because of a die roll. if the bard is using magic to force another player to do stuff then theyre just being a dick

10,"context???

Is it present?? Or just a vague post?"
10,"not in 5e they aren't, not by default. they usually work or live in similar areas, but they're not related. not even back in 2e either, I think orcs have always been separate from goblinoids in d&d"

10,if all you care about is punching shit then drunken master or open hand are the subclasses for that
10,"yeah, bugbears, goblins, and hobgonlins are all in the category of goblinoid, but theyre also still monstrous humanoids along with those other races. theyre even listed in the monstrous adventurers section of volos"
10,"it's just how they've been categorized from the start. depending on the edition/setting (particularly in the 5e art), goblins actually tend to bear more resemblance to bugbears, albeit with less hair. the 5 goblin and bugbear have similarly proportioned ears and facial features, similar skin tone, and even similar armor, weapon, and pose in their depictions in the monster manual. not to mention they share a language

the only thing orcs tend to have in common with goblins is green skin (and even that's not necessarily the default for either race in 5). orcs have much smaller ears, and are much more aggressive in their lifestyle whereas goblinoids typically keep to their own territory"
10,"monstrous humanoids

and bugbears *are* goblinoids. orcs, gnolls, and ogres (they're actually giants, not humanoids) are their own things"
10,k
10,yes the companion can make ***1*** attack. they can't do the multiattack action
10,volos guide
10,animate dead is the main spell you'll need. the other one for animation is create undead which can be used to create a wight which can then create *their own* zombies

10,"they would be less likely to be directly targeted, but they're *concealed*, but converted, so attacks would just have disadvantage. saves are unaffected

10,"the closest i got (without dying) was the very first dungeon in LMoP, almost died to a random goblin arrow, but other than that i played pretty tactically and backed off if i ever got low while not in wild shape

but the one time i didnt play smart was the time i died though. i touched a random talking sword and it just disintegrated me. i stayed as a ghost for the remainder of that dungeon though so i wasnt just sitting it out"
10,"if you already have someone with support spells going on or youre still concentrating on your own spell, sure, otherwise, it might be better to take the hits then pop back into beast form as soon as you drop. i played a druid from lvl 1-5 and i dont think i ever use that feature once and i didnt have a hard time with going unconscious (i dont think i even went down once lol)

combat wild shape gets really useful, though, if you multiclass as barbarian since you effectively have double hp when you rage, so any healing basically has double the usefulness"

the thing about spindown is that theyre easier to fudge/cheat with, but if you trust your players and vice versa it shouldnt be an issue"
10,"the highest you can actually obtain is 30 if you read 10 Manuals of Gainful Exercise (or wait 1,000 years and read the same one 10 times) if you have 20 STR. and the tallest race in the game currently is the firbolg (8'2"" max. they used to be 10'+ in older editions)"

10,yes

10,"no, youre still limited to PHB+1. im pretty sure aasimar and the tiefling subraces arent freebies either"

10,"one way to handle PC lycans is to have the NPC stat blocks of lycans represent people who have gone completely feral and/or embraced the curse (this process could take years). if you just got bitten a few days ago or are a shifter (i think canonically theyre half-lycans), you dont get the full suite of features and immunities, but you get some of them. and thatll open the avenue to multiclass into lycan blood hunter down the line if they want to

if they dont take measures to remove or suppress/control the curse (like going blood hunter), after a few years, theyre just gonna become fully feral and basically be an NPC. after all, lycanthropy is a curse, youre not supposed to *want* it"
10,"its on page 105. its a trap, not a monster"
10,attack bonus is for the d20 roll. you add your ability modifier and proficiency bonus if youre proficient in whatever youre using to attack. for damage you just add the ability modifier
10,you just roll the damage dice and add 3 to it. thats how much damage youre doing on that hit. your attack bonuses are different from your damage bonuses
10,"no, 5e intentionally strayed away from the damage reduction of 3.5e because resistance/immunity/vulnerability is much more simple. for all of the instances of NPCs fighting lycans, you can just give them magic weapons/attacks. and another thing you could do is have monsters with nonmagical immunity/resistance to also have their attacks be magical by default. that way it solves your lycan problem and prevents the terrasque from being beaten by a solo clay golem

if a player wants to be a lycan, they should be a shifter and/or use the lycan subclass for the blood hunter"
10,broken as fuck
10,XGtE has rules for making scrolls on page 133. and keep in mind that you can only use a scroll if the spell written on it is on your class' spell list. so you cant make a scroll of fireball and hand it to the druid or cleric for them to use
10,"if you think thatll be interesting for your group, sure. i personally dont think a djinni would do that in this situation. a marid or dao probably would, though, but a djinni would probably only do that if they knew that the wizard who got the wish were definitely evil"
10,"that's what happens when you try to wish for something ambitious like that. they're lucky it wasn't a dao or efreeti. they would have just had the book contain like the *names* of all the spells, but not the actual spells themselves"
10,"I wanna say the djinni gives them all the spells that *they* know. so detect good and evil, detect magic, thunderwave, create food and water (can create wine instead of water), tongues, wind walk, conjure elemental (air elemental only), creation, gaseous form, invisibility, major image, and plane shift are added to his book. some of those aren't wizard spells, so he won't be able to cast them without multiclassing and a lot of them are too high of a level for him to cast now"
10,what kind of genie and what was their ***exact*** word of the wish?
10,"yeah, just take some existing stat block, make some changes to it (maybe add a couple of class features to it too), and give it a personality. don't bother with level"

10,"1. tell everyone to plan out their turn beforehand. if they have a question about a rule, they should have the book opened up and ready before their turn comes around

2. roll attacks and damage at the same time. maybe color or size code your dice so you dont mix up one attack's damage for another. example: your first attack is always the red d20 and your second is the blue one and the damage dice are the same color as their d20

3. for the druid, work with them to make a swarm stat block of whatever animals they tend to want to summon. give it about the same health and damage as the individual animals combined so they arent cheated out of the spell, but split its damage up into 2-3 separate attack rolls. as the swarm loses hp, give it fewer attacks. that way they can still be effective without slogging down combat to roll 16d20s and god knows how many d4s

4. tell everyone to know their shit and have most of their class features memorized. they only have one character to keep track of and 5e is pretty rules-lite in this regard

2. we just heard that the druid there might have info on wave echo cave. we were level 4 by that time so we didn't have a tough time there (though the DM removed the green dragon from the area for later use). so if the players ignore the slaves or just never get a chance to speak to them, have someone else in town know the druid and suggest they go find him

3. divide xp evenly. personally, I suggest just ignoring xp and using milestone progression if your game is more narrative focused. it removes a lot of work as the DM since you don't need to worry about putting exactly enough encounters into the game to get the players to a certain level. you just have them level up when it feels right"
10,"keep healing spells on hand but don't feel like you have to be spending them every round to keep everyone topped up. healing is better utilized during combat to bring someone up from 0 and it's better to spend your spells buffing allies or preventing damage outright when no one is dying

10,">  just for the shield, if he doesn't allow me to do that

what do you mean by ""shield""? the spirit is not a creature or object, so it cant block attacks or anything. or were you just referring to the temp hp? if thats the case then why would your DM not let you get temp hp from your own feature?

also, you can do more than just be a temp hp vending machine. use the unicorn spirit to heal others or the hawk spirit to help your allies land a crucial hit during battle (really useful for rogues, paladins, and anyone with the elven accuracy feat). and since you mentioned getting 9 temp hp, i assume youre level 4? the bread and butter of shepherd is summoning things like the conjure animals or conjure woodland beings spells. once you hit 5th and then 6th level, youll be a lot more than just a heal bot"
10,"i mean, if you have 14 allies in a fight already, adding a little bit of temp hp to them probably isnt gonna be a big deal at that point. and keep in mind that temp hp doesnt stack. you cant give them 9 one round and then give them another 9 next round for 18 total. you can just refresh the temp hp to 9 each round. also, temp hp does not revive you if youre at 0, you need actual hp to bring someone up from unconsciousness"

10,"one shots are an adventure thats supposed to take place over the course of 1 (or sometimes 2) sessions, usually with different characters and not a lot of commitment required

regular campaigns typically span months IRL and are often played one session each week or so. these require a bit more commitment, but allow for more time with your characters

organized play/AL and west march are pretty similar. theres typically a handful of DMs who run various mini-adventures or one shots with and usually have some sort of objective loot/reward system as well as some baseline rules for character creations (AL for instance only lets you use the PHB +1 other book of your choice for your character). these games are usually drop in/out meaning you can just walk into a place thats hosting one and have a good chance of just playing right there"
10,"thats just how smites work. yeah its strong, but if you only save your smites for crits, youre a lot more likely to never use them and have a surplus of slots when its time for your next long rest. and a paladin not utilizing their smites is basically just a subpar fighter in terms of damage"
10,yeah its not a blanket feature. its just something most or all undead happen to have in their lore stuff. its just in the lore parts rather than the stat block because that stuff typically isnt too important most of the time (especially during combat) so they just dont have it take up space on the block

10,"just reskin monsters. a lot of the AQ monsters are already similar to D&D monsters. drakel and dwakel are lizardfolk and kobolds respectively, sneevils are goblins, etc. i havent played AW or AQW in years, but i cant recall any monsters in either game that wouldnt have a D&D counterpart"
10,"if you dont plan on grappling, then prioritize CON over STR. besides, you might find some ogre gauntlets later on to make up for it"
10,"INT or WIS might be more useful if youre leaning more on the thief side of things for investigation or perception. if you want to be an assassin or just a silver tongue in general then take CHA. CON should take priority over STR, but if you put expertise in athletics you can be good grappler if your STR is at least decent"
10,grab spell sniper and the booming blade cantrip or just reskin shocking grasp or lightning lure
10,"if its inanimate, its an object. if it still has actions and stats its a creature. so RAW you could only cast mending on skeletons that have been dropped to 0hp"
10,"if your DM thinks its reasonable then its reasonable. its not that hard to find dead people when youre an adventurer, especially is youre morally ambiguous. id say itd probably take a couple of hours per skeleton, so this would have to be a downtime activity or basically repair one skeleton per long rest"
10,its not a familiar RAW. ask your DM
10,"yes, its accounting for every sort of armor its wearing. thats why it lists it"
10,">what is stopping an illusion wizard from casting a minor or major illusion of a skin tight adamantine mold over the head of a creature then turn the the illusion real and thus strangling the creature?

the last sentence of the Illusory Reality feature: ""The object can't deal damage ***or directly harm anyone***."" youre gonna need a reeeeeeeally lenient DM to ever have strangulation not be considered ""directly harmful"""
10,"rolling is very common. i was referring to adding the results up being the houserule. but yeah, rolling is the very first method in the 5e PHB for stat generation"
10,"thats a somewhat common houserule, but i think keeping the values and moving them around is more common since thats the way prescribed in the book, at least in 5e"
10,"for the most part, 5e has done away with penalties at character creation; only 2 official races have penalties: the kobold and orc which get a -2 to STR and INT respectively. theyre often considered the weakest races in the whole game in terms of mechanics. and the way 5e is set up, having a +2 and +1 to an ability score isnt a huge deal since, at best, it increases your modifier by 1 which is a 5% increase over someone without that bonus"
10,"~~no~~

if you can do it, so can NPCs"
10,"this is the main reason why i think just straight up rolling is a bad idea. if youre going to have them roll, i think there ought to be some criteria for your stats. like rerolling anything below 7, starting over if you dont get at least two 15s, and letting them put the results wherever they want. that way you lower the risk of people just having Captain Average in the same party as Actual Hercules

if youre going to let these two reroll, you should also give the rest of the group an opportunity as well if they dont like their stats"
10,"not in 5e. they increase certain ability scores and give a few extra traits, but do not affect level at all"
10,"thats a very narrow a restrictive way to rule it. animals are very much capable of more than that. plus, its magic. its meant to overcome the mundane language barriers. and the spell description even says what most beasts are likely to be able to respond with and its a lot more than just yes or no"
10,"i was accounting for racial modifiers. so with a +2/+1 race, you could get 17,16,12,11,10,8"
10,"its a flavor/RP spell. the whole point of it is to be able to talk to them, so the DM ruling that having 2-4 INT makes them incapable of understanding you defeats the whole purpose of the spell entirely"
10,"its a homebrew rule, you should ask the guy who made it"
10,"yeah no thats not fair. he said to roll and you rolled. its not your fault that he wasnt ready to accept the possibility of decent stats. plus, those arent *amazing*, you have one really good stat and one above average stat, but you can get ***really*** close to those stats with basic point buy"
10,"itd be strong, yeah, but if you only give these special bolts out as often as you do other consumable magic items, it shouldnt be that big of a deal. itd just be a one-and-done instance of a few more chances for damage. knocking it down to 1d8 is fine too if you want them to be a bit more common"
10,">Will it even do any damage to characters with 10 AC?

if you roll 10 or higher on the attack roll, yeah. AC doesnt reduce damage taken

id have this thing just fire a set amount of bolts. id start with it just firing 3 every time, but you only add your damage mod to the total rather than each bolt. having it be 1d4 bolts could make it basically useless 50% of the time and just about average the other half. if you only fire 1 or 2 bolts, youre not doing much more than a light crossbow and the other half youre just barely beating the regular heavy crossbow

or maybe a better way to handle a multishot crossbow could be to just have magic ammo that splits into multiple bolts. so you fire it from a heavy crossbow itll split into 3 separate 1d10 damage bolts. that way you get the multishot feel without just being flat out better or worse than a regular weapon since the usefulness will depend on how liberal the DM is with magic items/ammo"
10,you can swap out an invocation when you level up
10,reskin an imp as a celestial/angel
10,"up to the DM. they could come from a god of nature, but its not a requirement"
10,druids get their magic form nature. bards are basically like wizards when it comes to their magic
10,"i havent had a need for it. if you only care about that feature, then i dont think its worth the subscription. the main thing i would get the subscription for is the extra storage space if you upload a lot of tokens or maps"
10,"the main thing is to make sure everyone has a decent microphone and connection. other than that, roll20 works the same as any white board or graph paper you would draw on IRL. you draw maps or import pics then scale them to a grid. once you fiddle around with the setting a bit, youll get the hang of it. theres even a fog of war feature, so if you want to keep a whole dungeon/area up at once instead of making several, smaller maps, you can black out areas the players havent seen yet

also, use a separate service for voice/video chat like discord. you can even invite bots to your server that can do all sorts of things like play music, manage roles, or even just shitpost with image filters"
10,its entirely up to the DM. you can start a campaign at level 13 if you wanted
10,druids dont get shocking grasp
10,"yeah, it's always bugged me that its at a different rate than cantrips. if you're going to make any changes to the breath weapon, having it match cantrip progression should be one of them"
10,"those kinds of things are intended for NPCs. the DM is free to allow it for a PC, but it's not by default"
10,"depends on its stats and what edition youre playing. assuming 5e, just reskin any axe or the glaive/halberd"
10,"you should talk to your DM about it. they should know that this is something about your character and should try to put other things in encounters for you to do. i doubt *every* encounter is just spiders (if thats the case, thatd be very boring). if you ever are in an encounter of just spiders, just try to assist your allies when you can. taking the help action or using buff spells if youre a caster

or maybe your character has a crisis of faith and could denounce lolth and his oath to not harm a spider. either way, you should still talk to your DM"
10,"they can look however you want. subclasses dont always have to have a predetermined aesthetic or style to them, especially one as wild as wild magic sorcerer"
10,"r/characterdrawing

r/hungryartists"
10,ooooooh i misread the post my bad. i thought they were asking why there werent any games based off of the game
10,"probably, idk. i dont use dice trays since i play online mostly right now"
10,i didnt know they made a game based off the cartoon lol. i thought the show didnt do very well back in the day?
10,"get more sets of dice. if you cycle around your dice enough, it could be yeeeeeears before you notice any wear and tear on any of them. also rolling softer surfaces, like a felt-lined dice tray, can help too"
10,"Neverwinter MMO, neverwinter nights, baldurs gate, a ton of DOS games for AD&D, a plethora of AD&D ripoffs/inspired games on the NES, etc."
10,"they dont speak any languages in 5e. you could certainly teach them commands in draconic like a dog, but they dont have the capacity to speak or learn an actual language as a whole"
10,"no, they determine your modifier which can make beating DCs easier and if any of your features has a DC, increasing that ability score will also increase that DC"
10,up to you/the DM
10,"depends on the source. class features and spells depend on the class, theyll tell you when they come up. monsters and their abilities have the DCs on their stat block. anything else is just made up by the DM depending on the circumstances

***EDIT:*** you flaired the post for 5e, but said youre playing 3e in another comment. i have no clue how DCs work in 3e"
10,"i think all the giant-kin are lumped into the same rank officially, but it makes sense for CR to play a part. obviously an average ettin it much stronger than a regular ogre, and a troll can mop the floor with them if theres no fire involved"
10,[heres a good way to get started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTD2RZz6mlo&)
10,temp hp does not stack. no its not broken
10,care to elaborate?
10,"only if you go out of your way to make a terrible character, like an orc wizard and you put INT as your lowest stat. tiefling druid isnt terrible at all, youll just be about 5% behind the rest of the party in exchange for a cooler story and some extra spells"
10,"yeah, but this isnt skyrim. enemies will catch on and then try to rush you or theyll hold their action for when you pop out. in a vacuum, yeah it sounds kinda cheap, but the DM can have other threats come from other directions if needed"
10,"1. no, but ive heard its just as good. the roll20 drama is almost a year ago so its blown over by now

2. just go with whatever the DM says. take a ""yes and"" approach to it

3. like, its strong, but its definitely overrated and i have yet to see it stifle creativity or strategy. with hundreds of spells in the game, there are bound to be some that are better than others. fireball is just one of the heavy hitters for AoE at its level. and there are plenty of other, just as useful options for an arcane caster's 3rd level spell. counterspell and dispel magic can come in clutch and be way more helpful than a fireball could have been. see how a rule or ability works out in game before touching the ban hammer (imo, nothing in default 5e needs nerfing. not even flying PC races)"
10,">Did WotC change the lore for 5th edition?

probably. you can just use whichever one sounds cooler to you. maybe its both. the ettin have existed for so long, that theyve gained status in the Ordning, maybe one rung above ogres, but not quite as high as trolls. even the weakest of hill giants has superiority over the strongest ettin

i stick with the orc/demogorgon lore because it makes sense in my setting"
10,"1. roll20 (a free virtual table top) and discord (skype but a lot better) is a good combo

2. i havent bought anything from Beyond before so idk how the books work, but you can just access the various rules. and in order for your players to see it, youd need to pay for the subscription (its only like $5 USD per month i think) so that players in your campaigns can see the stuff youve bought. as for a german translation, idk if thats available on the site

3. dont worry about knowing all of the rules before you start playing, just get the basics understood and wing it as you go. after a session, you can look up rules and then go into the next session with that knowledge (dont worry about retconning things, just go with the flow)

4. it takes you from level 1 to about level 5. id recommend trying a one shot adventure [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTD2RZz6mlo&) before deciding if this hobby is one you and your friends want to put any money into

5. r/lfg

6. id stick with the rules as written for a few sessions before implementing homebrew or changing anything

7. no, dont nerf fireball. its supposed to be strong. its just part of D&D

8. freezing sphere does more damage, but youre usually more likely to encounter things that resist cold than you are for necrotic. but yeah, some spells are just better than others like mordenkainen's sword is just a shitty version of spiritual weapon

9. if youre playing online, roll20 will do that for you. if youre playing IRL then just get some graph paper or a dry erase board and draw maps on it. for minis you can use spare dice or coins or whatever you want. some people use candies for enemies and when you defeat one you get to eat it

10. you can make your characters however you want. if youre all new, its perfectly acceptable for your characters to basically just be yourselves"
10,[heres a good way to get started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTD2RZz6mlo&)
10,"none of them are really ""best"". if your breath weapon deals an uncommon damage type, youd also have resistance to that uncommon damage type. and lines and cones have their niches to fill. cones are shorter range, cover a wider area, but have a higher risk of friendly fire. lines are a longer range, but narrower area, but have less risk of friendly fire and are most useful in narrow hallways or if youre ambushing people at a conga dancing competition"
10,"i found the link, but it literally says that by RAW cantrips are permanent. if you want to homebrew letting players swap them like other spells or as you level up, thats fine, but claiming such a rule is RAW if just false"
10,r/lfg
10,"im really confused on your stance. you say theyre overpowered, but then say theyre underwhelming. those contradict one another

>not needing air to breathe

thats honestly only useful in very niche situations. it wont make you immune to spells like cloudkill

> immune to diseases

disease is already an underutilized mechanic and is very easy to cure to begin with. a handful of classes even become immune to disease and you just need a standard lesser restoration to remove diseases

their bread and butter: the integrated protection is also strong, yes, but it has quite a few drawbacks. youll basically never be able to benefit from any magic armor you come across, and you already need proficiency with the various levels of your protection anyway to benefit from them. your AC is capped at 22 (or 24 with a shield) assuming no other bonuses, which honestly isnt outrageously high considering. by the time your prof bonus gets you to that AC, enemies can hit 20+ AC no problem"
